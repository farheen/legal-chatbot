A full and comprehensive statement of the incidental facts involved in the case may be found in the opinion of this court filed in said first cited case, to which reference is hereby had. It is not thought necessary, for the purposes of this opinion, to set them forth here any more fully.</p>
    <p id="b841-5" data-blocks='[["BL_841.4",841,[80,588,1315,288]]]'>The Board of Appeals stated in its decision that in the cases just cited and referred to, <em>“ </em>the production of the ether of cellulose was of a general nature but the disclosures related more particularly to ethers that may be regarded broadly as the ethyl type. In this interference the subject matter of the counts is limited to benzyl ethers of cellulose.”</p>
    <p id="b841-6" data-blocks='[["BL_841.5",841,[80,890,1318,954]]]'>It is argued by Dreyfus that Lilienfeld is not entitled to priority on count 1, because of the fact that the Austrian application, A-2709-19, filed on August 1, 1919,'does not disclose the subject matter of said count. The principal point which is made in this respect is that Lilienfeld included in his said application two examples of how he proposed to make his particular product, and that it has been established by the testimony of experts shown in the record that these examples are inaccurate and inoperable. Arguing from these premises, Dreyfus contends that the disclosure is insufficient'. The particular fault which Dreyfus finds in this respect is that the applicant in the Austrian patent A-2709-19, in his examples, proposes : First, to impregnate 100 kilograms of cellulose with 500 to 1,000 kilograms of 18 per cent caustic soda solution and permit the same to stand for from one to three days, and to then press, centrifuge, or suck the same to a weight of 180 to 200 kilograms. Second, to impregnate 100 kilograms of cellulose with 500 to 1,000 kilograms of 30 per cent caustic soda solution, permit this to stand for from 6 to 48 hours, and then press, centrifuge, or suck the same to a weight of 90 to 120 kilograms.</p>
    <p id="b841-7" data-blocks='[["BL_841.6",841,[84,1847,1315,198]]]'>Lilienfeld’s United States application here involved gives nine examples, the first one of which is exactly the same as example 1 of his Austrian application above referred to.

    <p id="b841-8" data-blocks='[["BL_841.7",841,[84,2047,1324,250]]]'>Dreyfus contends that Lilienfeld afterwards, in his application of September 26, 1919, corrected these examples, thus admitting he was in error in giving them in the first instance. From this he argues that Lilienfeld should be held to be the junior inventor because of' Dreyfus’s application of September 1, 1919.</p>

We are of opinion, however, that a consider<a id="p1524" href="#p1524" data-label="1524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1524</a>ation of the evidence will lead to the conclusion that we are not justified in reversing the decisions of the .Patent Office. The experts who have testified differ on this question, and we shall therefore not distúrb the finding of the Board of Appeals on this issue. Example No. 1, at least under the evidence, should be considered as operable.</p>
    <p id="b842-3" data-blocks='[["BL_842.4",842,[243,498,1320,599]]]'>Inasmuch as the party Dreyfus has challenged the right of the party Lilienfeld to priority upon said count 1, it becomes important to ascertain what disclosure was made by said Austrian application, A-2709-19. It is contended by Dreyfus that Lilienfeld should not be entitled to the date of this Austrian application as it makes no disclosure of the subject matter of the count. It will be observed that all the counts of this interference are general in character, and give no specific proportions of the respective chemical substances which are to be used in the process or products obtained. Therefore, if the Austrian application in question teaches the process in a general way, it is sufficient upon which Lilienfeld may base his contentions. We find, in said application, the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b842-4" data-blocks='[["BL_842.5",842,[246,1143,1318,64]]]'>A PROCESS FOR PREPARING- ALKALI CELLULOSES WHICH CONTAIN AN EXCESS OF CAUSTIC ALKALI AND ARE POOR IN WATER</blockquote>

We are well aware of the rule which requires the disclosure of a foreign patent to be so full and complete that no experimentation is required to follow it. However, this count of the interference being so broadly drawn reads, upon this Lilienfeld disclosure.</p>

We are unable to find anything in the various Austrian applications of Lilienfeld which amounts to a statement that he proposes the treatment of a cellulosic body “ not soluble in alkali.” As it does not appear to be questioned that Dreyfus does not show this, this count of the interference, as well as other counts, being taken from Dreyfus’s American patent No. 1451330, granted April 10, 1923, on an application filed <a id="p1525" href="#p1525" data-label="1525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1525</a>August 5,1920, it follows that Dreyfus was properly awarded priority as to this count.</p>

In an attempt to sustantiate the claim of counsel in this respect, a statement is made in the brief that communication has been had with Lilienfeld since this material was submitted, and that he has stated that he used a cellulosic substance not soluble in alkali. Such a statement is not supported by the record and is highly improper, and will not be considered by the court.</p>

The examiner of interferences held, and Lilienfeld contends, that his Austrian application, No. A-2703-19, filed August 1, 1919, was a sufficient disclosure of the subject matter of these counts. In the specification of this application we find the following:</p>

Said patent 1483738 was issued on application No. 436380, filed January 10, 1921. The Austrian patent, based on said application No. A-1141-19, had been issued, according to the uncontested statement of the examiner of interferences, prior to the issuance of said American patent.</p>

These bridging United States applications are in the record, and although they may not have been specifically called to the attention of the examiner, they were at all times within the judicial notice of the tribunals of the Patent Office.
