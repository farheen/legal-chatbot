Later that day, appellant and Rodriguez argued once again in front of Rodriguez’ home. When Rodriguez’ sister, Diane Hernandez, attempted to block appellant’s path and prevent him from entering the house, appellant kicked her in the stomach and knocked her to the ground. The police were called and soon arrived. Although they attempted to arrest appellant, he was able to elude them by jumping out of a second story window and fleeing the area.

Appellant argues that the trial court’s denial of his severance motion impermissibly allowed the Commonwealth to proceed against appellant for the murder of Officer Montijo in the same trial that it prosecuted appellant for his assaults against Jose Rodriguez and Diane Hernandez. Appellant argues that the admission of the facts and circumstances of the earlier assaults was unnecessary for the Commonwealth to prove any issue related to the killing of Officer Montijo.

Appellant argues that since no such nexus was established the evidence had no probative value, or, in the alternative, that the photographs still should have been excluded because the prejudice caused by the introduction of those photographs far outweighed their probative value.

The wall of appellant’s room was covered in graffiti and included the words “Fair-hill Street Gang” (referring to the street on which appellant lived), and “Fuck the Police.” These writings were signed “Spock,” which was appellant’s street name. After the murder, the police returned to Room 161 and took photographs of the graffiti and these pictures were subsequently introduced into evidence. The expression “Fuck the Police” clearly reveals appellant’s generally malicious attitude toward police officers. The photographs of the graffiti, therefore, were relevant to show that appellant had a fixed bias against police officers and that such bias could have contributed to appellant’s motive for and malice in shooting Officer Montijo, a police officer.

First, appellant asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct when, over defense counsel’s objection, he asked a defense expert psychologist if his opinion that appellant felt remorse for Officer Montijo’s death would change if he knew about a post-verdict exchange between appellant and Officer Montijo’s family. The basis of this argument is that post-verdict, appellant made an obscene gesture at members of the victim’s family by raising his right middle finger to them and told them that the slain officer “got what he deserved.” During the penalty phase, appellant presented this psychologist to testify that appellant felt remorse for Officer Montijo’s death in an effort to persuade the jury to mitigate their consideration of appellant’s <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>penalty for Officer Montijo’s murder. Appellant argues that the hypothetical was improper because there was no evidence of record supporting the hypothetical as required by <em>Commonwealth v. Petrovich, </em><a href="/pa/538/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="538 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="475529" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0369-01">538 Pa. 369</a>, 372, <a href="/pa/538/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="648 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="475529,7874552" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0369-01,/a2d/648/0771-01">648 A.2d 771</a>, 772 (1994) (an expert may give his opinion in response to a hypothetical, provided that the set of facts assumed in the hypothetical is eventually supported by competent evidence). However, the issue of appellant’s remorse (or lack thereof) for Officer Montijo’s death was not introduced until the defense put its psychologist on the stand. The prosecution, therefore, had no opportunity to present the testimonial evidence of appellant’s confrontation with Officer Monti-jo’s family before posing the hypothetical to the psychologist. At a sidebar conference, the Commonwealth informed the trial court that it was prepared to offer the testimony of 20 potential witnesses to prove the occurrence of the post-verdict event. Upon learning of the basis of the Commonwealth’s hypothetical, the trial court ruled that the Commonwealth’s question was proper and that the Commonwealth could present the evidence on the incident if the expert testified that it might alter his opinion. The prosecutor committed no misconduct on this point because a good faith basis for the hypothetical existed at the time the question was posed. <em>Petrovich, supra. </em>After the sidebar discussion, the expert, upon further cross-examination, refused to apply the term “remorse” to appellant’s feelings regarding his murder of Officer Montijo. On this basis, the trial court ultimately ruled the issue moot and declined to let the prosecutor continue to proceed with this line of questioning. Under these circumstances, the prosecutor clearly did not commit misconduct merely by posing his hypothetical question to test a defense expert’s opinion.</p>

The prosecutor attempted to expand the jury’s focus from the punishment of appellant on the basis of one aggravating circumstance (i.e., that appellant killed a police officer acting in the line of duty), to punishment of appellant on the basis of society’s victimization at the hands of drug dealers. The essence of the prosecutor’s argument was to convince the jury to sentence appellant to death as a form of retribution for the ills inflicted on society by those who sell drugs. The prosecutor prejudiced the jury by forming in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward appellant with these highly prejudicial statements. We believe the jury was unavoidably unable to dispassionately and objectively evaluate the evidence in a sober and reflective-frame of mind.</p>

This, we believe, went far beyond the permissible limits of oratorical flair and aggressive advocacy. <em>See Commonwealth v. Chambers, </em><a href="/pa/528/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="528 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1829794" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0558-01">528 Pa. 558</a>, 584, <a href="/pa/528/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="528 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1829794" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0558-01">599 A.2d 630</a>, 643 (1991) (prosecutor’s statement to jury during closing argument of sentencing proceeding that the Bible says “and the murderer shall be put to death” was prejudicial error). Because appellant correctly argues that the prosecutor’s comments during the penalty phase were so prejudicial as to deprive him of a fair penalty determination, we find that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to object to these comments which left the jury with a fixed bias against appellant based upon comments not grounded in evidence of record. Further, we believe that counsel’s failure to object was more susceptible to causing an unfair penalty determination since, here, the jury found two mitigating circumstances and only one aggravating circumstance. The prosecutor’s comments were such that they could have impermissi-bly shifted the balance in favor of a death sentence. Therefore, since trial counsel could not have had a reasonable basis for not objecting, we find trial counsel ineffective. <em>See Commonwealth v.
