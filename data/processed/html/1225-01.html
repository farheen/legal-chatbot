The trial justice found that the children had initially been removed from the parental home due to their mother’s intoxication. He found that, although the children could have been placed with respondent, he was “unavailable,” due to the fact that he was incarcerated on multiple occasions when placement was necessary (including a period of incarceration beginning two days after Cullen’s birth).</p>

The trial justice noted that, although respondent contended that he had insufficient funds to pay for treatment, he had never sought financial aid or reimbursement with respect to the cost of the required treatment. He further found that respondent had failed to complete an initial assessment with respect to his parenting skills and was therefore terminated by the pertinent agency.
