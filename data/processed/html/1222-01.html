Pa.R.A.P., Rule 1701(b)(2), 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. Ann. Appellees argue that the principle espoused in Rule 1701(b)(2) is also applicable to the stay pursuant to Rule 341(c). We disagree.</p>

Pursuant to Rule 1701, the length of time the trial court proceedings will be delayed is indefinite and outside the control of the trial court. Under such circumstances, the power embodied in Rule 1701(b)(2) is necessary to allow the trial court to enforce its orders to prevent Appellants from using the appeal process merely as a vehicle to evade compliance with valid trial court orders.</p>

Furthermore, the trial court has the power to end the stay at any time prior to 30 days by simply ruling on the application. Pa.R.A.P., Rule 341(c)(3), 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann.

However, the word “stay” is used in other areas of Chapter 17 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. In the subsection that explains how to obtain the stay or superse-deas mentioned in Rule 1701(b)(2), the Rules state that an “[application for a stay of an order of a lower court pending appeal ... must ordinarily be made in the first instance to the lower court .... ” Pa.R.A.P., Rule 1732(a), 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.

As a result, there is no final order in this matter, as defined by Pa.R.A.P., Rule 341(b), 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. ANN.

Our hesitance is reinforced by the fact that the denial of an application for determination of finality has been explicitly entrusted to the discretion of the trial court. The issue of the proper standard of review of a determination of finality has not previously been explicitly addressed by this Court. <em>See, e.g., Pullman Power Products of Canada, Ltd. v. Basic Engineers, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/713/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="713 A.2d 1169" data-case-ids="11828004" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/1169-01">713 A.2d 1169</a> (Pa.Super.1998) (reviewing a trial court’s determination of finality without stating a standard of review). However, the rule itself does explicitly provide that the <em>denial </em>of an application will be reviewable only for an abuse of discretion. Pa.R.A.P., Rule 341(c)(2), 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. Accordingly, we must remand these matters until the Application for Determination of Finality has been addressed. The 30 day period for deciding the Application for Finality shall begin to run as of the date of this opinion.</p>

We acknowledge that, as a general rule, the failure of an appellant to file a concise statement when ordered by the trial court acts as a waiver of all issues on appeal. <em>Everett Cash Mutual Insurance Company v. T.H.E. Insurance Company, </em><a href="/a2d/804/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="804 A.2d 31" data-case-ids="11416740" data-case-paths="/a2d/804/0031-01">804 A.2d 31</a> (Pa.Super.2002). This Court has previously held that providing the statement to the trial judge, but not filing it, also acts as a waiver. <em>Bryant v. Glazier Supermarkets, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/823/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="823 A.2d 154" data-case-ids="9122178" data-case-paths="/a2d/823/0154-01">823 A.2d 154</a>, 156 (Pa.Super.2003). In this case, however, unlike the situation in <em>Bryant, </em>Appellants not only timely provided the concise statement to the trial judge, they also filed it, albeit late. In Judge Friedman's opinion in support of her order granting summary judgment, she stated "[i]n their Concise Statements of Matters Complained of on Appeal, Plaintiffs raise similar issues as to both cases.” Trial Court Opinion, 12/18/2003, at 5. Therefore, it is evident from the certified record that the trial court received the concise statement. As stated above, the statement appears of record in the supplemental certified record. Therefore both Roth and Shenango have properly preserved their issues on appeal.</p>
