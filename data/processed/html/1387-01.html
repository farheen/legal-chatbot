It has historical importance for its use as the Masonic Temple from 1870 to 1908. Its location opposite the Old Patent Office (now designated the American Art Portrait Gallery) enhances its importance to the architectural and aesthetic integrity of the city.</p>

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 8,1974, and, as a Category II Landmark, on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites since the Inventory was first established in 1964. The building was subjected to substantial architectural changes in the 1920’s to make it more suitable for commercial use, acquiring at that time the name “Lansburgh’s” in reference to the store which occupied it. It is now unoccupied, structurally sound, and in a poor condition of maintenance and repair. These facts are uncontested by all parties.</p>

That agreement provided for an exchange of land then held by petitioner for the property on which the Building is located plus additional sums of money. The YWCA held a lease and an option to purchase on the Building and its site. A fixed sum ($594,000) plus an additional sum of up to a maximum of $48,000, payment of which was contingent upon the speed and ultimate success of petitioner in obtaining the requisite authorization to demolish the Building, was to be paid by the YWCA to appellant in addition to the property exchange. The exchange was effected according to the agreement, except petitioner, and not the YWCA, made the purchase of the Building and its site directly from the then owner of record under the option to purchase.</p>

As prescribed under that earlier Regulation, the Joint Committee on Landmarks considered the application for demolition and advised against it. The Mayor subsequently entered an order on March 2,1979, delaying demolition pending negotiations with civic associations and public agencies with regard to ways in which the Building might be saved.</p>

The Mayor was required, prior to determining to issue the demolition permit, to hold a public hearing.

This is not such a case. The mere sale of a property does not expunge the rights of the prior owner, which become vested in the new owner, to compensation for taking its property. However, in this case, we must weigh in our calculations the listing of the Building on designated historical preservation rosters, the difficulties encountered by a prior owner in securing a permit for demolition of the Building, the terms of the agreement between the YWCA and appellant which contemplated the possibility that obtaining a permit to demolish the Building would be neither swift nor certain, and the publicized efforts of the City Council to enact a more stringent historical preservation statute.</p>

Purchases of land such as in the instant case are, by their very nature, speculative and profits on use of the land, if indeed there are any, or its appreciation in value, must necessarily be conjectural. If, as petitioner states in its brief (Petitioner’s Brief at 9), its transaction with the YWCA constituted, in part, a virtual charitable contribution, any analysis of the expectation of profit is necessarily even more unascertainable.</p>

Petitioner also argues that certain prescribed safety renovations were required by statute, or at least by concern for public safety, before other uses could be made of the Building.

The fact that the Mayor’s Agent adopted some of the language from the Proposed Findings of Intervenor Don’t Tear It Down, Inc., does not make the Mayor’s Agent’s conclusions invalid or unacceptable. In the recent case of <em>District Concrete Co., Inc. v. Bernstein Concrete Corp., </em>D.C.App., <a href="/a2d/418/1030-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="418 A.2d 1030" data-case-ids="7965012" data-case-paths="/a2d/418/1030-01">418 A.2d 1030</a> (1980), this court found in a similar situation, where the trial court had rejected at least one portion of the party’s proposal, that “the essential inquiry on review in such a case is whether these ‘findings and conclusions ultimately represent the judge’s own determinations.’ ” <em><a href="/a2d/418/1030-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="418 A.2d 1030" data-case-ids="7965012" data-case-paths="/a2d/418/1030-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/418/1030-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="418 A.2d 1030" data-case-ids="7965012" data-case-paths="/a2d/418/1030-01">at 1035</a>, <em>quoting Sullivan v.

This principle is applicable to administrative settings and, therefore, the adoption by the Mayor’s Agent of substantial portions of the Intervenor’s Findings of Fact is not, per se, objectionable. We need not directly address the application of that principle in the instant case since our decision rests upon grounds, i. e., alternative economic use rather than reasonable profit, that make many of the Mayor’s Agent’s findings inessential to a determination of the case. We note, parenthetically, that the Mayor’s Agent obviously did much more than adopt uncritically the proposals of the intervenor.</p>
