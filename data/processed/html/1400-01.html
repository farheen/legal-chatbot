        <em> </em>The examiner’s use of the terms “colorable distinction” and “colorable difference” shows how unsatisfactory the word “colorable” is as a means of communicating a clear idea of the ground of rejection. The examiner says the “same Invention” Is being claimed as Is claimed in the patent. What then does he Intend by the term “colorable”? Does he mean there Is <em>no </em>difference or distinction or does he mean that the difference— the use of Y-type zeolite — is <em>obvious 1 </em>If he does not intend the latter meaning, then why does he rely on Rabo et al? It does not take a reference to show that there Is no difference. It may take one to show that where there Is a difference, the difference is not such as to render the claimed invention as a whole unobvious.
