Mark’s death was investigated by the Pennsylvania State Police on behalf of the District Attorney. Thereafter, Hughes ruled that Mark’s death was a suicide. Nader, not accepting Mark’s death to be a sui<a id="p749" href="#p749" data-label="749" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*749</a>cide, engaged the services of an attorney and a private investigator. Nader, after an investigation by the private investigator, asked Hughes that a coroner’s jury be impaneled for the purpose of determining the manner of Mark’s death, which request was denied. Nader alleges that he has suffered “incalculable stress and mental anguish ... over ... the refusal of ... the Coroner’s office to act responsibly” and that he, Nader, has an intense interest, “both religious ... and social, in clearing the stigma of suicide from the family and the deceased.” The relief sought by Nader in the mandamus action was for the trial court to enter judgment against Hughes, commanding him to impanel a coroner’s jury and conduct an inquest into the death of Mark.</p>
