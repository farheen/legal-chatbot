    <p id="b583-7" data-blocks='[["BL_583.6",583,[152,643,754,297]]]'>¶ 1 D.D. (father), appeals from the order entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Juvenile Division, which, following a hearing, adjudicated his teenage daughter, K.A.D. (d.o.b.5/14/85), a dependent child. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b583-8" data-blocks='[["BL_583.7",583,[152,967,753,664]]]'>¶2 The record reveals that mother and father of K.A.D. divorced when she was three years old. She has been in the primary physical custody of mother since that time. Although a custody order grants father partial custody every other weekend, K.A.D. has not had an overnight visit with father since 1993 and during the twelve month period prior to the dependency hearing, father visited with K.A.D. a total of fifteen hours. Father had no visits with K.A.D. for seven consecutive months prior to the hearing.</p>
    <p id="b583-9" data-blocks='[["BL_583.8",583,[152,1658,754,873]]]'>¶ 3 K.A.D. is diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Depression. She is treated with anti-depressants and counseling therapy but has been non-compliant with her medication regimen and therapy appointments. K.A.D. has had numerous instances of runaway behavior and staying out all night. Her mother reported her missing to the police seven times between June of 1999 and September of 2000. K.A.D. has frequently been truant from school. When she attends school, she is habitually tardy (71 episodes of tardiness during the 1999— 2000 school year, 68 of which were unexcused). K.A.D. abuses drugs and alcohol.</p>

In September of 2000, CYS filed a petition seeking adjudication of dependency on the statutory ground that K.A.D. had “committed a specific act or acts of habitual disobedience of the reasonable and lawful commands of [her] parent, guardian or other custodian and ... is ungovernable and ... in need of care, treatment and supervision[.]” 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 6301(6). The petition also sought adjudication on the basis that K.A.D. “while subject to compulsory school attendance is habitually and without justification truant from school[.]” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6302(5).</p>
    <p id="b583-14" data-blocks='[["BL_583.11",583,[951,1108,755,1183]]]'>¶ 5 A hearing on the petition was conducted in which father participated by telephone. He testified that he opposed the petition on the ground that he was “ready, willing and able” to take custody of K.A.D. He testified that if custody were transferred, he would provide greater discipline and supervision than mother. Father testified that he is twice divorced and has three other children, none of whom live with him. He is currently single. He testified that if given custody, he would search for suitable housing for himself and K.A.D. Father stated that he and KA.D. could live temporarily with father’s parents until he could find suitable housing. K.A.D. testified that she is afraid of father because he allegedly abused her in the past. She testified that she didn’t want to live with father, but wanted to stay with mother and she promised the court that she was going to behave more appropriately in the future.</p>

In <em>In re M.L., </em>mother and father were never married and mother had primary physical custody of the subject child with father having partial custody every other weekend. Mother suffered from psychological difficulties which rendered her unable to properly care for the child. The trial court, on petition from Cambria County CYS and after a hearing, adjudicated the child dependent and awarded custody to father. For the purposes of appeal, our supreme court considered the first definition of “de-pendant child” as contained in subsection (1) of section 6302 of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301 <em>et. seq. </em>It limited its review “to the issue of whether a court may properly adjudge a child to be dependent where the non-custodial parent is ready, willing and able to provide the child with proper parental care and control.” <em><a href="/a2d/757/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="757 A.2d 849" data-case-ids="11243635,225992" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0849-01,/pa/562/0646-01">Id.</a></em>

Clearly, the statutory reasons K.A.D. was adjudicated dependent differ from those upon which the subject child in <em>In re M.L. </em>was adjudicated. In <em>In re M.L., </em>the child was found dependent due to the inabilities of the custodial parent to provide proper care pursuant to § 6302(1).
