    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[208,568,753,571]]]'>This is an appeal by the Waterville Urban Renewal Authority, the defendant, from the assessment of damages by a jury for the taking of plaintiff’s property by eminent domain. 30 M.R.S.A. § 4807. In the words of the defendants’ counsel “The sole issue in this case is whether or not the expert witness engaged by the condemning authority to appraise the premises in question should have been allowed to testify as an expert in behalf of the opposing party to this action, namely the landowner.”</p>
    <p id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[207,1192,752,424]]]'>The facts are not in dispute. Mr. St. Pierre, called by the plaintiff in rebuttal, testified that he had made an appraisal of the plaintiff’s property in January 1963 for the defendant, and that in his opinion the fair market value of the property was then $27,500. The witness was offered for the purpose of impeaching the testimony of an expert offered by the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b344-7" data-blocks='[["BL_344.7",344,[202,1670,754,471]]]'>Objection was made by the defendant to the use of the witness by the plaintiff on three grounds: (1) That the witness had made the appraisal for and at the expense of the defendant, (2) that by contract with the defendant the witness was prohibited from divulging any information which he gathered as a result of his appraisal, and (3)that the opinion of the witness was a privileged communication.</p>
    <p id="b344-9" data-blocks='[["BL_344.8",344,[204,2186,751,233]]]'>The defendant contends that the evidence was privileged (1) under a privilege analogous to that of an attorney and client, and (2) by virtue of Rule 26(b) M.R.C.P. relating to Discovery and Depositions.</p>

A privilege existing on the facts before us prohibiting the witness from testifying without the consent of the defendant would extend the rule of privileged communication far beyond its present bounds.</p>

The reasons for the privilege in the attorney-client relationship are not present in the expert witness area under consideration. There is nothing about an opinion on the fair value of real estate that requires secrecy. Surely with no physician-patient privilege and the priest-penitent privilege only by statute, we cannot expect to find, and we do not find, an employer-expert privilege excluding the opinion on the value of real estate by the expert.</p>

The reason for this is plainly to prevent a party from obtaining without cost the benefit of an expert’s opinion for which his adversary has paid in preparation for trial. It stems from the same principle that protects the attorney’s working files from discovery. The policy behind the rule applies equally to the taking of an expert’s deposition.”</blockquote>

No new privilege operative to keep otherwise admissible evidence from the Court and jury was thereby created. The Rule was designed to regulate the discovery and deposition process before the trial and as a part thereof to protect a party against the necessity of disclosing the “work product”, so-called. The opinion of the expert, although it might be admissible at trial, was for purposes of Rule 26(b) placed in the category of the “work product”.</p>

He remains a live person, available to give testimony and in particular to give his informed opinion. The fact that the opinion was obtained at the expense of the defendant and for its information and use only, does not force the conclusion that the expert may not testify from the stand at the request of the opposing party without the consent of his employer.</p>
