There is overwhelming support in the record for the judge’s resolution of that question in the affirmative. Each of the homeowners was drawn to the appellants by advertising which promised the availability of “money to lend” to stop imminent foreclosure. When the homeowners asked for the loans which they believed that the advertisements were describing, and then posed questions about the form of the transactions, the appellants couched their answers to these questions in language which confirmed to the complainants that they were receiving the very loans for which they had come. The appellants often simply calmed the inquiring homeowners’ fears by pretending that it was usual practice, perhaps required by the accountant, to sign instruments transferring title to the homes. The trial court credited the homeowners’ testimony and gave a comprehensive and persuasive explanation for having done so. An appellate court may not disregard the reasoned resolution of issues of credibility on the part of the trier of fact.</p>

When a homeowner sells his home, which is usually his most valuable possession, one would expect at least some measure of bargaining over the sales price. Here, there was none. In each instance, what the appellants characterize as the “sales” price bore no relation whatever to the value of the equity. It is absurd to suggest that Mrs. Carroll would knowingly sell her home, in which she had an equity of more than $36,500.00, for $8,100.00. None of the “sellers” had placed his or her home on the market or expressed the slightest interest in selling it. Each “seller” remained in possession after the purported sale, and appellants were indeed depicting their service as one that would enable their clients to “save” their homes from foreclosure. Although the transaction also lacked one of the common characteristics of a loan — an evaluation of the borrower’s credit — no such investigation was needed because the home itself, which in each case was worth far more than the amount expended by the appellants, served as their security. It was therefore altogether reasonable for the trial judge to find that the depiction of each of these transactions as a sale and lease back was a transparent sham which masked an unlawful loan.</p>

There is, however, nothing in the language of § 26-701 or in the parallel Regulation, 16 DCMR § 201.1, to support such a limitation. Moreover, appellants’ contention is foreclosed by the decision in <em>Hartman v. Lubar, </em><a href="/citations/?q=77%20U.S.%20App.%20D.C.%2095" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="77 U.S. App. D.C. 95">77 U.S.App.D.C. 95</a>, <a href="/f2d/133/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="133 F.2d 44" data-case-ids="3649659" data-case-paths="/f2d/133/0044-01">133 F.2d 44</a> (1942), in which the principal authorities relied upon by appellants are carefully explored and distinguished.</p>
