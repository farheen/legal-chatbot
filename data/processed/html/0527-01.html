Two weeks later, he paid his initial premium to appellant’s soliciting agent and was told that his coverage commenced as of that date. In return <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>for his payment appellee received a receipt which stated, in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[240,371,705,178]]]'>No obligation is incurred by said Company by reason of this payment unless said application is accepted and a policy issued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[202,594,746,328]]]'>On February 4 appellee was injured in an accident. He was hospitalized and incurred expenses of the type covered by the policy applied for. Shortly thereafter, on February 15, United issued a policy to Collins which, by its terms, provided coverage for losses arising on or after that date.</p>
    <p id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[198,958,748,425]]]'>Collins brought suit against appellant in the trial court claiming benefits under his policy for the hospitalization and related expenses resulting from the accident on February 4. After hearing testimony and receiving exhibits, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that appellee was covered by the policy and awarded him a judgment of ‘$647.50.</p>
    <p id="b564-7" data-blocks='[["BL_564.7",564,[194,1422,749,328]]]'>Appellant argues that the language of the receipt and policy specifying that the insurer accepts no obligation until issuing a policy is clear and unambiguous, and that the trial court erred in finding that coverage began prior to the issuance of the policy. We agree, and reverse.</p>

This is especially true where the restrictions upon the authority of the agent to make contracts or waive conditions contained in the application are known or should be known to the insured, or where the agent was wholly unauthorized so to agree, and the agreement was unwarranted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
