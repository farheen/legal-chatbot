Duval appeals from a judgment entered in the Superior Court (Hancock County, <em>Beaulieu, J.) </em>on a jury verdict convicting him of theft. Duval contends <em>inter alia </em>that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on the elements of theft by unauthorized taking pursuant to 17-A M.R.S.A. § 353 (1983) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> when the indictment charged Duval with theft by deception pursuant to section 354.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Duval argues further that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Finding no error in the court’s instructions and the evidence sufficient to support Duval’s conviction, we affirm the judgment.</p>

Although at the outset the parties intended to complete the inventory before beginning to sell the antiques, soon after Duval began the inventory he commenced to sell some of the antiques to local dealers. Although Du-val had McDonald’s permission to sell at least some of the antiques, Duval failed to remit ninety percent of the proceeds to McDonald.</p>

Duval suffered no prejudice because of the variance between the indictment and the proof or because of the court’s instruction as generated by the evidence. <em>See State v.

The record in this case contained sufficient evidence to support a finding that Duval had committed theft by deception or theft by unauthorized taking. The evidence established that Duval represented himself as an experienced antique dealer, that he knew he was not an experienced antique dealer, that McDonald relied on his representation, that as a result of his representations Duval received from McDonald property of value, that Duval sold the property to various antique dealers, and that he did not remit the proceeds of the sales to McDonald. While Duval testified he had never taken any property from McDonald without express permission and that he intended to pay her according to their agreement, the jury could have inferred from his inability to recall the terms of the agreement and from his failure to make more than token payments to McDonald that he never intended to honor it. In its assessment of witness credibility the jury was free to discount Duval’s testimony and place greater weight on the testimony of the State’s witnesses. <em>State v. Lee, </em><a href="/a2d/583/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="583 A.2d 212" data-case-ids="7372547" data-case-paths="/a2d/583/0212-01">583 A.2d 212</a>, 214 (Me. 1990).
