    <p id="b1047-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1047.6",1047,[192,1514,1325,388]]]'>We think the present application is insufficient to teach one skilled in the art to carry out its objective for substantially the same reasons. It is true that the excerpts from Rougeron cited by appellants set out values of temperature and pressures to be attained in an atomic boiler. However, the reference does not disclose procedures which satisfy us that one skilled in the art would be enabled by appellants’ disclosure to provide a pool of molten salt from which a useful amount of energy could be attained.</p>
    <p id="b1047-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1047.7",1047,[194,1919,1323,550]]]'>Also, the reference in the AEC Report to leakage of steam in the Project Gnome explosion leaves serious doubt that appellants’ disclosure would enable persons skilled in the art to maintain steam pressure in the cavern. Appellants’ argument that their specification would cause a person following it to “do his utmost to thermally and pressure insulate the cavern” is not convincing since the real question is whether such person following the teaching of the specification would be able to seal the cavern effectively, not whether he would try to do so. The record does not satisfy us that the question can be answered in appellants’ favor. In Project Gnome steam escaped although only a 5 kiloton explosion was involved.</p>

      <em>* </em>* * as to claims 1 through 12, the novelty <em>* * * </em>resides in using a salt dome or salt formation as the site for the nuclear device. The issue, therefore, is whether the use of the salt dome or salt formation imparts patentability to claims 1 through 12.</blockquote>

One of ordinary skill in this field who contemplates utilizing underground nuclear explosions to obtain useful energy at the earth’s surface would be expected to have some knowledge of geology. Statements in Eougeron that an underground thermonuclear boiler can be adapted to any soil and that any insufficiency in the boiler formed in granite can be overcome by using more compressible calcareous rocks or sedimentary soil would not be ignored by such a person contemplating formation of an underground boiler. The existence of salt formations being known, as well as the fact that water elution techniques permit forming a cavern therein, it seems clear that one of ordinary skill in the ai't would conceive of using such a formation as the site for the boiler.</p>
