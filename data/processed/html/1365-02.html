    <p id="b1433-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1433.24",1433,[995,1444,750,563]]]'>After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that the Family Court had jurisdiction pursuant to G.L.1956 (1985 Reenactment) § 8-10-3 to enforce a property settlement agreement even after divorce between the parties had become final. Although we believe that the defendant’s appeal was interlocutory, we have decided that the interests of both parties require us to address the matter of subject matter jurisdiction on the merits.</p>
