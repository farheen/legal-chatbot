The Governor acknowledged Judge Heckler’s resignation by letter of February 2, 2009, noting that his resignation would become effective at the close of business February 10, 2009.

Two vacancies were created by the resignations of Judge Kenneth Biehn, effective July 7, <a id="p1279" href="#p1279" data-label="1279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1279</a>2007, and Judge Mitchell S. Goldberg, effective October 30, 2008. The third vacancy was created by the fact that Judge John J. Rufe will reach the mandatory retirement age for judges in 2009. Secretary Cortés’ notice did not identify the fourth vacancy created by Judge Heckler’s resignation. Relying upon Article V, § 13(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Secretary determined that a judicial office vacancy must exist ten months before the November election in order for that vacancy to be filled in the same year. This year’s Municipal Election will take place on November 3, 2009, and, therefore, a judicial vacancy had to be created no later than January 3, 2009, in order to be filled in the 2009 Municipal Election cycle. Because Judge Heckler’s vacancy was created on February 11, 2009, less than nine months before the 2009 Municipal Election, the Secretary determined that Judge Heckler’s seat must be filled by appointment of the Governor to serve until the 2011 Municipal Election.</p>

Specifically, he urges the Court to construe the Pennsylvania Constitution as setting up only a presumption that a judicial vacancy must occur at least ten months before a municipal election in order for the seat to be filled by election that same year. This presumption can be rebutted by a litigant who persuades the Court that adding vacancies to the ballot less than ten months before the Municipal Election will not cause prejudice. Accordingly, vacancies can continue to be added to the ballot throughout the ten-month election period until such an addition would cause prejudice. Candidate Otter further explains that the Secretary may continue to use the ten-month vacancy rule when preparing his notice to the County Board of Elections; the Secretary’s notice will remain legally effective unless and until challenged in litigation.</p>
    <p id="b1307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1307.6",1307,[923,823,754,608]]]'>Intervenor, Chairman Fawkes, also seeks to have four judges elected to the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas in 2009. The Chairman does not agree with Candidate Otter that Article V, § 13(b) establishes a mere presumption that, if rebutted by a litigant, allows candidates to be added to the ballot at any point up to the date of the November election. The Chairman offers a different proposal for implementing the mandate in Article V, § 13.</p>

In this case, that date was February 17, 2009, which fell after Judge Heckler’s resignation became effective. Accordingly, Chairman Fawkes’ rule would allow the listing of four vacancies on the ballot for judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County. In support of his proposal, Chairman Fawkes observes that the ten-month rule recited in Article V, § 13(b), is not sacrosanct, noting that our Supreme Court has already recognized an exception for judges who are facing their mandatory retirement in a Municipal Election year. Indeed, as noted by Chairman Fawkes, because Judge Rufe will serve as a judge in Bucks County until the end of 2009, there will be no vacancy for his seat until <em>after </em>the 2009 Municipal Election. <a id="p1280" href="#p1280" data-label="1280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1280</a>Nevertheless, the replacement for Judge Rufe will be elected this year in accordance with Supreme Court precedent.</p>

The Secretary observes that in addition to Bucks County, other judicial vacancies have been created by death and resignation since January 3, 2009, in Delaware, Greene, Luzerne and Philadelphia Counties. From now until election day, judicial vacancies may continue to occur. Accordingly, the Secretary, and the public, need certainty on how to handle unanticipated vacancies that occur less than ten months before the election scheduled for November 3, 2009. The Secretary rejects the proposal of Candidate Otter to have ballot positions for unanticipated vacancies determined by litigation, as completely at odds with an orderly election process. Further, it will result in an election process that will vary from county to county, depending on whether litigation is initiated. The Secretary also rejects the bright line rule proposed by Chairman Fawkes because it will give prospective judicial candidates nine months, not the ten months contemplated in Article V, § 13, to participate in the election process.</p>

At present, the electorate and putative future judicial candidates believe there will be one judicial vacancy in Delaware County filled this year and two judicial vacancies filled in the 2011 Municipal Election, as a result of the death of one judge and the resignation of another that took place after January 3, 2009. If the Secretary is required to adopt either Candidate Otter’s or Chairman Fawkes’ rule, then Cordes and other putative candidates will have to work with undue haste to qualify for placement on the 2009 primary ballot, to establish a campaign committee and to make arrangements for a major career change.</p>

      <em>Jackson </em>is the Supreme Court’s most recent exposition of Article V, § 13(b).

Jackson initiated litigation to have this vacancy filled in the 1985 Municipal Election, invoking <em>Berardocco </em>and <em>Barbieri </em>as standing for the principle that where a vacancy arises “before the commencement of the electoral process,” it must be filled by election. <em><a href="/pa/507/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="507 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="1792385" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0626-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/507/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="507 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="1792385" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0626-01">at 632</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="507 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="1792385" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0626-01">493 A.2d at 690</a>.

The petitioners sought to increase the number of offices on the ballot from seven to eight. In support, they noted that candidates on 25 nomination petitions had been certified to appear on the primary ballot as Democratic candidates and eight had been certified to appear as Republican candidates. Accordingly, there were enough candidates to justify petitioners’ proposed increase in the ballot positions. This Court agreed and issued a writ of mandamus to the Secretary, noting that the ongoing election process ensured “a full slate of candidates endorsed by both parties to fill the seat vacated.... ” <em><a href="/pa/582/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="872 A.2d 170" data-case-ids="650266,8975042" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0423-01,/a2d/872/0170-01">Id.</a> </em>at 801 n. 8.

Because of <em>Brady, </em>Cordes cannot rely on Secretary Cortés’ February 17, 2009, notice to the County Boards of Elections as dispositive of that question.
