Appellant Mann’s application<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was filed February 14, 1958. Two interferences were declared, with Mann as the junior party in each.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In separate decisions, the Board of Patent Interferences awarded priority of invention to appellees in both interferences.

Accordingly, both appeals will be disposed of in this opinion.</p>

Consequently, the issue here, as it was before the board in both interferences, is whether Mann has proved actual reduction to practice of the inventions of the counts prior to appellees’ filing date. To prove an actual reduction to practice, Mann introduced the testimony of a number of witnesses, as well as numerous exhibits. After a detailed consideration of this evidence, the board concluded that, as to the single count in each interference, Mann has shown utility for the compositions and had established, in every particular save one, actual preparation of the compositions. According to the board, the missing link in Mann’s chain of proof was that the evidence failed to corroborate his assertion that one of the starting materials was in fact polybutadiene, a material called for in each count. In each case, board member Willner dissented, taking the position that the record as a whole provided sufficient corroboration of Mann’s testimony regarding the starting materials and that actual preparation of the compositions of the counts had thus been proved.</p>
    <p id="b904-3" data-blocks='[["BL_904.4",904,[294,1096,1329,387]]]'>Accordingly, the only question presented on this appeal is whether the record evidence supports appellant’s assertion that polybutadiene was one of the starting materials used in preparing the compositions of the counts. Our review of the record has convinced us that the board erred and that the position of the dissenting examiner is in accordance with prevailing law. For the reasons set forth below, therefore, we find it necessary to <em>reverse </em>the appealed decision in each case.</p>
    <p id="b904-4" data-blocks='[["BL_904.5",904,[294,1500,1326,551]]]'>The record shows that during the time of the alleged reduction to practice, Mann was employed as a chemist in the General Laboratories of U.S. Rubber at Passaic, New Jersey. Under the direct supervision of Mann at that time were one Herbert Maguire and his assistant. Stanley Buj as. The record clearly establishes, and the board so found, that Maguire and Bujas, in May 1956, carried out bottle polymeriza-tions wherein a substance alleged to be polybutadiene latex was utilized as the substrate in the preparation of the compositions of the counts. The determinative question is whether the record contains sufficient corroborative evidence to prove, by a preponderance of all the evidence, that such substance was indeed polybutadiene latex.</p>
    <p id="b904-5" data-blocks='[["BL_904.6",904,[295,2058,1326,397]]]'>The critical bit of documentary evidence on behalf of Mann is Exhibit 2, which is a printed form titled “Chemical Processing Job Ticket” and bearing identification number “01228.” It purports to be an order, submitted by Maguire, requesting the production of a polybutadiene latex for use in preparing the compositions of the counts. Mann relies upon this document, along with testimony of various witnesses, to corroborate his allegation that a polybutadiene latex was actually made and delivered to his co-workers. .</p>

The Pilot Plant was, in the words of its supervisor, Walter Dunn, “a small group that was preparing—essentially doing a service job, preparing polymers for different departments in the Research Center [General Laboratories].” It was located in a smaller building separate from the one in which Mann and his associates worked.</p>
    <p id="b905-4" data-blocks='[["BL_905.4",905,[181,779,1321,350]]]'>The job ticket form, as initially filled out and signed by Maguire, contained a detailed list of materials, including quantities, and a seven-step “loading procedure.” Under “Type and Purpose” on the form there is the notation “Polybutadiene for MMA Grafts (Planner’s ref. P-201-1),”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and the last step of the loading procedure reads “Deliver to planner as latex.” In this instance the planner was Maguire, since he submitted the job ticket to the Pilot Plant.</p>
    <p id="b905-5" data-blocks='[["BL_905.5",905,[180,1135,1322,596]]]'>One Franklin Miller was the chemical operator in the Pilot Plant who was assigned the job of weighing out the various materials called for in job ticket 01228. Miller testified that he had been working in the Pilot Plant since 1953, and described in some detail how he went about his work, the loading procedure, where various ingredients were obtained, etc. The ticket bears his initials under a column headed “Weighed By.” We think the record fairly establishes that one of the materials which Miller loaded into a reactor to start the polymerization reaction was in fact butadiene. Miller testified he got butadiene gas from a tank in which it was normally kept, the tank being marked “Butadiene.” On cross-examination, Miller testified further as follows:</p>

    <p id="b908-14" data-blocks='[["BL_908.14",908,[318,2206,1325,247]]]'>We think this testimony shows that Maguire got the material from someone, and after six years was simply unable to remember the details of that particular delivery.

As pointed out previously, Winslow, who suprvised the preparation of the material in accordance with job ticket 01228, stated that it was “very standard procedure” and that he had no reason to believe “that Schreiber had not, in fact, delivered the latex.” Mann also testified regarding the well-established delivery procedure:</p>

I will ask you merely to tell us, based on your experience with Chem Engineering, with initiating job ticket requests, what the ordinary practice would have been in returning this finished polybutadiene to the planner. A. One of the operators would carry the latax in a can from the Pilot Plant to the main laboratory building. He would probably send it up—we were on the third floor—send it to the third floor on the dumbwaiter. If he were coming to the third floor himself he would take it off the dumbwaiter and give it to Maguire. If he were not, he would call Maguire and tell him his latex was available.</blockquote>

However, in our opinion the basic question is not so much to whom. Degering returned the irradiated bags, but whether, the evidence establishes that the solutions of ammonium acetate which Murr analyzed were the same solutions which Degering irradiated. We think the evidence fairly supports the conclusion that the irradiated solutions and the analyzed solutions were the same.</blockquote>

Dunn, who further testified that the group “started to do polymerization work at that time” “about 1942” on “butadiene, styrene, G.R.S. development.” Maguire had, in my opinion, about as reasonable an expectation of getting polybutadiene latex on his order to this department as if he had ordered the preparation done by Firestone or some other rubber company. Before using the latex that went into the P-20S compositions Maguire had some tests made to assure himself that it had the per cent gel and the swelling index and viscosity in benzene that he expected and desired. * * * In my view considering the whole record, the evidence adduced in behalf of the party Mann provides under the burden of proof by a mere preponderance of evidence a reasonable prima facie case on the use of polybutadiene to prepare the eight gum plastics alluded to. * * *</blockquote>

        <em> </em>Mann’s Exhibit 1 is a substantially identical job ticket, bearing' number 01221, submitted by Mann. On this ticket the planner’s reference is P—201. Mann testified that “The 201 is my code. Dash-one means that it was done over again.” When asked what happened in connection with job ticket 01221, Mann stated : “The reaction proceeded. We formed our polymer. We got some flocculation toward the end of the run and threw it out, discarded this batch. We wanted to use it as latex, so the premature coagulation of some of the polymer would spoil it for that purpose.” This explains why it was necessary to have the Pilot Plant repeat the procedure originally outlined in ticket 01221.</p>
