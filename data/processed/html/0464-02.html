Code § 20-1002(2) (placing a limit of $10,000 per year on contributions from a business to a mayoral candidate’s campaign).

On January 25, 2007, Robert Brady, a member of the United States House of Representatives from the First Congressional District, formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination to serve as the Mayor of Philadelphia. The primary election for the mayoral race was to be held on May 15, 2007. Prior thereto, Brady’s candidacy was contested by Thomas Knox, who was also campaigning for the Democratic Party mayoral nomination. Knox alleged there were defects in Brady’s statement of financial interests, which Brady was required to file as part of his nominating petition. In defending against Knox’s challenge, the Committee hired the Firm to represent Brady in the election litigation. The Firm successfully litigated the challenge to Brady’s nomination and he remained on the ballot, but lost his bid for the nomination.</p>

In order to determine how it could legally retire the outstanding debt following the conclusion of the election, the Committee requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Board as to whether payments received by the Committee after the election would be subject to the campaign contribution limits set forth in Sections 1002(1) and (2) the Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Thereafter, on March 3, 2008, the Firm filed a declaratory judgment action on its own behalf naming the Ethics Board and the City as defendants and seeking a declaration that post-election contributions were not “contributions” as defined under Section 1001(6) of the Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In its complaint, the Firm specifically alleged that “an actual case and controversy of a justiciable nature exists between Plaintiff and Defendants” noting that, because of the ruling made by the Ethics Board, the Committee “has been improperly restricted by Defendants in its ability to raise funds to pay off post-campaign debts and [the Firm], according to the defendants, cannot forgive the debt without violating the election laws.” Complaint at 3, paragraph 8.</p>

In the alternative, the Ethics Board and City argued that if the advisory opinion was deemed to be a final, appealable order, the Committee, the only entity party to the decision, failed to file a timely appeal within thirty days after the entry of the “final adjudication.” Finally, the Ethics Board and the City argued that regardless of whether the advisory opinion was reviewable, the Firm, in its own right, lacked standing to pursue a declaratory judgment action because it was a mere unpaid campaign vendor which lacked the direct, substantial or immediate interest needed to confer standing to challenge the Ethics Board’s interpretation in its advisory opinion.</p>

The court did so on two bases. First, the court concluded that an advisory opinion, such as that of the Ethics Board, is not a final adjudication subject to review by the court. Second, the court ruled that the Firm lacked standing to prosecute the case, concluding that the relationship between it and the Committee regarding the debt is too tenuous to constitute a direct interest in this litigation.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth Court likened the position of the Firm to that taken by a nursing home operator in its prior case, <em>Beverly Healthcare-Murrysville v.

There, a nursing home provided care for a patient and then challenged the denial of the patient’s application for state-funded medical assistance that would have paid for the services. In holding that the nursing home lacked standing to bring such a challenge, the Commonwealth Court held that because the medical assistance program was intended to benefit recipients and not providers, the interest of the nursing home, as a creditor against the patient’s estate, in the outcome of the determination of eligibility for medical assistance was neither direct or immediate for purposes of the test for standing set forth in <em>Wm. Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">464 Pa. 168</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">346 A.2d 269</a> (1975)(providing that a person asserting standing must be aggrieved which requires a showing of a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the outcome of litigation). The court noted that the nursing home’s collateral concern in the outcome of the appeal did not satisfy traditional standing requirements. In this case, the Commonwealth Court concluded, as in <em>Beverly, </em>that the Firm, likewise, as a mere campaign creditor, had no direct or immediate interest in how, or if, the Committee could legally raise funds to pay off its debt to the Firm.</p>
    <p id="b521-7" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[936,639,751,1030]]]'>The Firm then filed a petition for allowance of appeal to this Court, asserting, as is relevant here, that the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding it lacked standing. Specifically, the Firm noted that the Commonwealth Court improperly viewed its claim as one based solely on its desire to determine whether, and how, the Committee could raise funds post-election so that it could be paid. The Firm, however, noted that in addition to seeking clarification of the Philadelphia campaign contribution law so that it could determine how the Committee could legally raise monies to pay off the debt, it also sought such clarification so that it could, in its own right, forgive the debt at issue at one time and in <em>toto. </em>Thus, the Firm sought, before this Court, a ruling that it possessed standing in this regard.</p>

Specifically, the Firm notes that if it were to forgive the total debt at one time, it would be at risk for substantial penalties and fines given the Ethics Board’s interpretation of the pertinent laws. It notes that pursuant to Code Section 612, the Firm would be subject to non-negotiable civil penalties for violating the campaign finance laws and, potentially, members of the Firm would be barred from holding elective office.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, it maintains that it pursued the proper and prudent course by seeking a declaratory judgment in order to determine what course it could take under the campaign finance laws given the position taken by the Ethics Board in its advisory opinion that any post-election contributions are subject to the Code’s contribution limits, and given that the Firm was not a party to the request for advisory relief.</p>

In fact, the Firm maintains, if the Commonwealth Court’s ruling on standing is upheld, it places the Firm in the position of facing a classic “Hobson’s choice” which is to either accept, in its view, the Board of Ethics’ erroneous construction of Philadelphia’s campaign finance laws and forgo the option of total debt forgiveness or risk significant legal jeopardy.</p>

There, Kathleen Shaulis, an assistant counsel with the Department of Revenue sought an advisory opinion from the State Ethics Commission regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>the scope of any limitations on her ability to practice law before the Department of Revenue following her retirement. The Commission, in its opinion, set forth various limitations with regard to such ability.

As the Commonwealth Court noted, to require Shaulis to potentially violate the Ethics Act in order to present her claims to the courts “jeopardizes her ethical rating, her admission to practice law and her reputation in the legal community.” Likewise, as the decision of the Commission effectively estopped Shaulis from representing clients in proceedings before the Department of Revenue or adverse to the Department of Revenue, she had a direct interest in the opinion.</blockquote>

According to the Firm, this is precisely the type of dilemma which the Declaratory Judgment Act is designed to counter by clarifying the relative rights of the parties involved in an imminent case or controversy before action is taken. Thus, the Firm argues that it has standing under this Court’s precedent in <em>Shaulis, </em>as it is aggrieved by the Ethics Board’s opinion and it has a direct interest in seeking review of the conclusions reached therein by way of its declaratory judgment action.</p>

It notes that under the well-settled precedent of this Court, <em>i.e. William Penn Parking </em>and its progeny, the core concept of standing involves a litigant who is aggrieved, as demonstrated by a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the outcome of litigation. A litigant possesses a substantial interest if there is a discernable adverse effect to an interest other than that of the general citizenry. It is direct if there is harm to that interest.

    <blockquote id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[181,1571,712,502]]]'>Did Cozen O’Connor have standing to obtain a declaratory judgment where Cozen O’Connor alleged in its complaint that it intended to forgive the outstanding debt of the Friends of Bob Brady Campaign Committee at one time and <em>in talo, </em>thereby exposing itself to potential civil penalties and other sanctions under Phila. Code § 20-612 for violations of Phila. Code § 20-1002?</blockquote>

Our review of the complaint, however, belies this assertion. While the references to debt forgiveness by the Firm are briefly stated and are among its assertions of its right to collect the debt owed to it from the Committee, such contentions are, nonetheless, stated.</p>
    <p id="b525-10" data-blocks='[["BL_525.10",525,[940,571,755,561]]]'>Specifically, in paragraph 8 of the complaint, the Firm asserts that because of the Ethics Board’s ruling in its advisory opinion, “the [Committee] has been improperly restricted by Defendants in its ability to raise funds to pay off post-campaign debts and [the Firm], according to defendants, cannot forgive the debt without violating the election laws.” In paragraph 67 of the complaint, the Firm, likewise, notes the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b525-11" data-blocks='[["BL_525.11",525,[982,1151,713,507]]]'>Moreover, should the campaign’s legal expenses be considered “expenditures” and funds solicited by [the Committee] to retire such debts “contributions,” [the Firm] would be legally unable to forgive any of the debts owed to it by the campaign, as doing so would constitute an in-kind contribution to the Brady campaign far in excess of the limits of Philadelphia Code § 2-1002.</blockquote>

In this regard, the Ethics Board states that “[n]otably, [the Firm] does not cite a single paragraph from its Complaint, the pleading in which [the Firm] must establish it has standing, wherein it alleges that it intends to forgive [the Committee’s] debt at one time and <em>in toto.” </em>Ethics Board’s brief at 9. Although the Firm did not set forth the exact phrase “that it intends to forgive the debt at one <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>time and <em>in toto,” </em>such is certainly contemplated by the above cited paragraphs. In those passages, the Firm references both the Committee’s inability to raise funds to pay off the debt, given the Ethics Board’s interpretation, and its own inability to forgive the debt based on such interpretation. Clearly, the Firm sought a declaratory judgment in order to clarify whether either of these two events could take place, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Committee could collect post-election contributions without regard to the campaign contribution limitations set forth in the Code or whether the Firm could forgive the debt without regard to the campaign contribution limitations.</p>

Thus, in our view, and contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion, the Firm has been aggrieved by the Ethics Board’s interpretation of the Code. Accordingly, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s decision and remand for further proceedings before that court.</p>

Along similar lines, the Board has filed an ancillary motion to dismiss the case as moot in response to an ancillary request for post-submission communication filed by the Firm. When the matter was argued before this Court, the Board, as Appellee, argued that the case was moot based upon a then-recent amendment to the Philadelphia Code regarding post-election fundraising activities of a political campaign committee as well as post-election debt forgiveness, the very matters concerning which the Firm sought clarification through its declaratory judgment action. Additionally, the Board noted that it was in the process of promulgating regulations, which have since been implemented, that permit a campaign debtor, such as the Firm, to forgive the type of debt at issue here, where certain conditions are met. Thus, the Ethics Board suggested at argument that such amendments, in essence, mooted the Firm's need to have the underlying question of whether it could forgive the Committee’s post-election debt clarified as these new Code and regulatory amendments detail that such debt is subject to the contribution limitations, but that it may be forgiven if certain factors are met.</p>
      <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[239,2137,718,527]],["BL_524.6",524,[1036,988,721,642]]]'>Because the Firm is the Appellant, it did not have an opportunity to respond at oral argument to the Ethics Board's assertion of mootness. Thus, the Firm filed the current ancillary motion for post-submission communication requesting that we reject the Board’s claim that the amended Code and regulations moot or otherwise dispose of the case. The Firm asserts that these enactments have no bearing on its ability to forgive the debt in question because the newly enacted provisions are not retroactive in nature. Additionally, the Firm asserts that even if the new provisions applied, it could not immediately forgive the outstanding debt at one time, <em>in toto, </em>which is the precise issue raised in its declaratory judgment action, because it does not satisfy the substantive prerequisites of the new debt forgiveness provision. Finally, the Firm asserts that the existence of new, prospective-only enactments (in the Firm’s view applying only to future elections) cannot moot the sole issue before this Court, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Firm possesses standing. The Firm has also filed a response to the Board’s ancillary motion to dismiss the case as moot based on the same reasoning as set forth in its motion seeking leave to file a post-submission communication.</p>
      <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.7",524,[1037,1643,721,1013]]]'>We grant the Firm's motion for post-submission communication. As noted, the Firm had no opportunity to respond to the Board’s new claim of mootness presented to the Court at oral argument; thus, we have reviewed its response. Having reviewed the Board’s motion to dismiss and the Firm’s response, we deny the motion to dismiss for mootness. Regardless of whether the newly enacted Code provisions and Ethics Board regulations moot the underlying merits of the case, such does not affect the discrete and only question pending before us regarding the Firm's standing. As further examined herein, we ultimately conclude that the Firm possesses standing. Given our conclusion on this narrow question, upon remand, the parties are free to move forward regarding the merits of the case, arguing <em>inter alia, </em>whether they are obligated to follow the campaign finance laws that applied when the debt was incurred or the law as it stands today. We decline to address this new issue injected into the case after our grant of allocatur, briefing and argument.</p>

Although the trial court concluded that the Ethics Board's advisory opinion was not subject to review as it was not a final adjudication, it did so after concluding that the Firm lacked standing. Thus, arguably, this alternative holding was <em>dicta. </em>Moreover, the Commonwealth Court did not affirm on that basis or even examine the issue; rather, the court affirmed exclusively on its conclusion that the Firm lacked standing.</p>
