Amarie Kappaz had arisen early that morning to fix breakfast. At some point during that morning, Amarie unlocked the back door which opens into the unfenced backyard. Sometime later, the Kappaz’ two-year-old daughter opened the unlocked door, allowing the dog to escape into the backyard. Amarie did not notice the dog was missing until a commotion outside drew her to the front door of the house where she found her dog on the stoop and let it in.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[182,1041,753,973]]]'>Meanwhile, the attack and injury to Chadbourne had occurred when he walked his dog in front of the house next door to the Kappazes. The Kappaz’ dog, which had been in the driveway of the neighboring house, suddenly came up to Chad-bourne’s dog and chomped down on its head. Chadbourne instinctively grabbed the Kappaz’ dog by the collar, causing it to let loose of his dog’s head. As Chad-bourne hung onto the dog’s collar, the dog lunged, twisting backwards, pulling him through the air, resulting in his forehead being smashed into the front door landing of the house next to the Kappazes. Chad-bourne suffered a bone-deep, seven inch gash across his forehead which required thirty-eight stitches and corrective surgery.</p>

The general rule in this jurisdiction is that “where a particular statutory or regulatory standard is enacted to protect persons in the plaintiffs position or to prevent the type of accident that occurred, and the plaintiff can establish his relationship to the statute, unexplained violation of that standard renders the defendant negligent as a matter of law.” <em>Ceco Corp. v.

Therefore, the trial court read jury instruction 5-9<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and instructed the jury as to negligence <em>per se </em>by stating that at the time of the incident, D.C.Code § 6-1008(a) was in effect, which read “[n]o owner of an animal shall allow the animal to go at large.” The trial court, after defining “at large” based on D.C.Code § 6-1001(1), further instructed the jury that an owner “allows” an animal to “go at large” if he “(a) intentionally permits the animal to go at large, or (b) fails to exercise due care to keep that animal from going at large. In determining the care required, you may consider the propensities of the animal known to the owner.” Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that if it found the defendants violated the statute and that the violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries, then it must find that the defendants were negligent.</p>

While we agree that the trial court’s definition of “allow” negated the impact Chadbourne was hoping for from the negligence <em>per se </em>instruction given to the jury, we conclude that the trial court’s modified instruction was not error because D.C.Code § 6-1008(a) is too general a statute to be the subject of a negligence <em>per se </em>instruction. <em>See McNeil Pharmaceutical v.
