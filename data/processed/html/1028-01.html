Stelea and Stacey Stelea, his wife, appeal from the order entered on December 31, 2001 in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County denying Appellants’ petition to modify, correct and/or vacate the underinsurance award of arbitrators. The issue on appeal involves voluntary waiver of underinsured motorist coverage and subsequent preclusion from recovering benefits for bodily injury from a separate automobile insurance policy issued on another vehicle owned by the motorist. The preclusion is based upon a household exclusion clause excluding underinsured motorist coverage for bodily injury suffered while operating a motor vehicle not insured for underinsured motorist coverage. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>

Furthermore, the rationale relied upon by the Court in <em>Burstein </em>is sound; otherwise, insureds would be able to collect underinsured motorist benefits from every policy on which they were a named insured, even if the insurer had not been compensated for the coverage, or even been informed of the risk. Insureds would be able to receive benefits far in excess of the amount of coverage for which they paid, and insurers would be forced to increase the cost of insurance, which would be patently unfair. Moreover, increased insurance costs is precisely what the public policy behind the MVFRL strives to prevent.</p>

Thus, according to Appellants, even if they were willing to pay a premium for underinsured motorist coverage, there was no way for them to do so under their policy of insurance with Appellee. Appellants further argue that the insurance contract exclusion, when taken together with Appellee’s refusal to insure the motorcycle, is “..unconscionable and therefore invalid.” Appellants’ Brief at 19. Inherent in Appellants’ argument is a claim that Ap-<a id="p1033" href="#p1033" data-label="1033" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1033</a>pellee had no right to refuse to insure their Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle upon their request.

    <p id="b1081-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1081.5",1081,[108,597,753,1441]]]'>¶ 12 Under the MVFRL, motorcycles have a less favored status compared to other motor vehicles. This is due, in part, to several dynamics that affect an insurer’s risks pertaining to motorcycles including, <em>inter alia, </em>the safety features of the vehicle; the risk of injury if involved in an accident; and the frequency of involvement in accidents. In fact, the less favored status of motorcycles is made quite clear upon a close reading of 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1711, Required Benefits, (recreational vehicles not intended for highway use, <em>motorcycles, </em>motor-driven cycles or motorized pedalcycles or like type vehicles, not the type of vehicles <em>required </em>to be covered under this title) (emphasis added); see also § 1712, Availability of Benefits, (insurers not required to provide medical benefits, income loss benefits, accidental death benefits, funeral benefits, and extraordinary medical benefits for motorcyclists); and 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1714, Ineligible Claimants, (precluding motorcyclists from recovering first party benefits).

From a practical standpoint, however, and in light of the inherent risks that flow from the operation of a Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle, Appellants could have taken affirmative steps to secure un-derinsured motorist coverage. Instead, Appellants chose not to obtain such protection on their policy of insurance with Progressive. Although Appellants offer no explanation for this failure, such underin-sured motorist coverage would have been made available to them pursuant to the requirements of 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1731(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Appellants waived underinsured motorist coverage for the motorcycle, it was their voluntary choice, and they are not now entitled to what would amount to free un-derinsured motorist protection from Ap-pellee.</p>
