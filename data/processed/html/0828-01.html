Erie contends that the trial court erred in finding an ambiguity in the insurance contract’s language “in the care of’ and extending coverage to Donald Bergen as an insured under the policy. Erie also asserts that the trial court erred when it determined that the language of Erie’s insurance policy did not require personal property to be “actively used” at the time of loss. We find that the trial court committed legal error when it concluded that the phrase “in the care of’ was ambiguous and found that based upon the undisputed facts, the Plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court’s order and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>
    <p id="b886-4" data-blocks='[["BL_886.4",886,[215,1361,756,872]]]'>¶2 Erie issued Gloria Mitsock (Mrs. Mitsock) a homeowner’s insurance policy that provided coverage for personal property loss. Mrs. Mitsock is the mother of April (nee Mitsock) Bergen (Mrs. Bergen). Mrs. Bergen and Donald Bergen (Mr. Bergen) were paramours who attended Lock Haven University. While attending college, Mr. and Mrs. Bergen resided at Mrs. Mitsock’s residence on a part-time basis during the summer months, spring break and holidays. In May 2001, Mr. and Mrs. Bergen were engaged to be married. Following their graduation from Lock Haven in May 2002, Mr. and Mrs. Bergen moved into Mrs. Mitsock’s residence and brought all of their personal belongings with them.</p>

The Plaintiffs stored various items of personal property at Safe Haven. Most of the items at Safe Haven belonged to both Mr. and Mrs. Bergen, or belonged to Mr. Bergen and were used by both him and Mrs. Bergen. On August 30, 2002, a fire occurred at Safe Haven and destroyed everything that the Plaintiffs had stored there. Thereafter, the Plaintiffs made a claim under Mrs. Mitsock’s homeowner’s insurance policy. Erie paid for the damage to Mrs. Mit-sock’s and Mrs. Bergen’s personal property, but refused to pay Mr. Bergen for his loss on the ground that he was not an insured under Mrs. Mitsock’s policy; that is, Erie denied Mr. Bergen coverage because he was not a “person[ ] in the care of’ Mrs. Mitsock at the time of the fire.</p>

On December 20, 2004, Erie filed a motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, the Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On April 7, 2005, the trial court denied Erie’s motion for summary judgment and granted the Plaintiffs’s cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court found the language of the policy (“in the care of’) to be ambiguous, and therefore, construed the provision in favor of Mr. Bergen and against Erie, the drafter of the agreement. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion (T.C.O.), 4/07/05, at 10. The parties then reached a stipulation regarding damages, and on November 9, 2005, the trial court entered a judgment awarding Mr. Bergen $20,800.00.</p>

Like some of our sister states, we find guidance in <em>Henderson </em>and adopt its eight common-sense factors to help aid the court in its analysis of the phrase “in the care of.” When ascertaining whether an individual is “in the care of’ the insured as a matter of contract interpretation, a court should consider the following factually-based factors:</p>

We also find it significant to mention that under the Policy’s definition of “anyone we protect,” one can be “in the care of’ an insured even though he/she is not a “relative” or a “ward” of the insured. <em>See </em>Policy, p. 4 (unnumbered), <a id="p834" href="#p834" data-label="834" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*834</a>R.R. 22a (defining “anyone we protect” to be: “1. relatives and wards; 2. <em>other persons </em>in the care of anyone we protect”) (emphasis added in italics). As a result, “in the care of’ is broader and more encompassing than a legally familial or custodial relationship, and thus, a court should place slight emphasis on <em>Henderson’s </em>first factor in situations where a legal relationship is lacking between an individual and the insured. <em>See Priest, </em><a href="/nj-super/370/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="370 N.J.

If, on the other hand, an insured has a legal responsibility to care for the individual, then <em>Henderson’s </em>first factor should almost always be dispositive and result in a finding that the individual is “in the care” of the insured, as long as the insured provides financial support (factor 4) or the basic necessities of life (factor 2).

Mr. Bergen was a 22 year old recent college graduate at the time of the fire (factor 6), temporarily living with his future mother-in-law until he and his fiancée could afford to buy or build a house (factor 5). Although Mr. Bergen lived with Mrs. Mitsoek, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Mrs. Mitsoek financially supported Mr. Bergen (factor 4) or that Mr. Bergen was dependent on Mrs. Mitsoek for food, clothing, shelter or transportation (factor 2). Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to support the proposition that Mrs. Bergen assumed supervisory or disciplinary responsibility over Mr. Bergen (factor 3) or that Mr. Bergen was of declining mental or physical health (factor 7). Therefore, the undisputed facts of the record do not entitle the Plaintiffs to judgment as a matter of law because they do not demonstrate that Mr. Bergen was in “the care of’ Mrs. Mitsoek at the time of the fire. <em>See Oliva, </em><a href="/citations/?q=842%20A.2d%2092" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="842 A.2d 92">842 A.2d at 96</a> (stating that “ ‘in the care of connotes a level of support, guidance and responsibility that is most often present in situations where an insured cares for a minor child, an elderly person, or an incapacitated individual.”). <a id="p835" href="#p835" data-label="835" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*835</a>Accordingly, we vacate the trial court’s order granting Plaintiffs’s summary judgment on their breach of contract claim and we remand the case for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>
