On appeal the State seeks to have us consider the findings of fact produced at a hearing on post-trial motions, held almost two months after trial. At this hearing, presided over by the substituted justice, the State proffered oral testimony to prove its “good faith efforts” at trial to satisfy the demands of “unavailability.” We cannot consider the foundation evidence produced at the post-trial hearing. So vital is the accused’s constitutional right to confront at <em>trial </em>the witnesses against him, that evidence procedure <em>after trial </em>on the question of unavailability does nothing to safeguard this fundamental right. Accordingly, we decide this case on the preliminary findings of the <em>trial </em>justice.</p>

In the instant case, the “time” specified on the subpoenas was “on the 28-31 day of January, 1980, at 8:30 a., m.” Such a broad time provision was not sufficiently specific to apprise the witnesses of when they should appear to testify.</p>
