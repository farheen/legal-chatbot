Upon her dismissal, Claimant applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which the local job office denied. Claimant appealed, and a hearing was held before a referee.</p>

However, Orgovan testified that Claimant began a pattern of absenteeism and tardiness, prompting her to place Claimant on probation for a period of thirty workdays, commencing on November 30, 1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On the last day of Claimant’s probation, January 17, 1999, Claimant phoned Employer and informed the bartender that Claimant would be unable to work the next day, January 18, 1999.

Claimant stated that her “daughter” was actually her six-year-old cousin whom Claimant was in the process of adopting. Although the funeral began at 11 a.m. and Claimant’s shift did not start until 6 p.m., Claimant testified that she needed the day off because her “daughter” was upset and Claimant needed to be with her.</p>

The UCBR found that Claimant was terminated based on her absence on January 18, 1999. (UCBR’s Findings of Fact, No. 14.)

(UCBR’s Decision at 3.) Thus, the UCBR concluded that Claimant had good cause for her absence on January 18, 1999 and reversed the decision of the referee. (UCBR’s Decision at 3.)

However, the basis of Employer’s argument is that Claimant had a history of absenteeism and tardiness and that Claimant failed to follow the proper call-out procedure when reporting off on January 17, 1999. The UCBR specifically found that Claimant was terminated because of her absence on January 18, 1999, not because of prior absences or the manner in which she reported off. Therefore, Employer confuses the issue. Claimant’s pri- or absences and alleged violation of the call-out procedure are irrelevant to a determination of whether Claimant had good cause for being absent on January 18, 1999, the only issue before this court. On that score, we agree with the UCBR that it was reasonable for Claimant to remain home to be with her “daughter” to comfort her on the day her grandmother was buried. Employer maintains that it was not reasonable because she was not really her “daughter.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> However, the fact that <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>Claimant was not the child’s biological mother is inconsequential. Claimant was the child’s primary caregiver, and, for the purposes of receiving unemployment compensation, we see no reason to draw a distinction between a biological familial relationship and a primary caregiver relationship. The evidence shows that Claimant was absent on January 18, 1999 in order to accompany the six-year-old child in her care to the funeral of that child’s grandmother and to care for and comfort the child that day in her distress. Therefore, Claimant had good cause for her absence on January 18,1999.</p>
