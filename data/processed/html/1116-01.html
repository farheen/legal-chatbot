As so illustrated, the riser pipe from the carburetor enters the center of the header and on each side of such openings three curved branches conduct the gases to the cylinders. This header is said tobe rectangular in form, but the drawings show, and appellant admits in his brief, that the inside corners are rounded. The inlet opening and the openings leading to the.cylinders are in one side of the header. The opposite side of the header is shaped as described in the specifications:</p>

Thus, the stream of mixture rushing through the inlet is deflected toward the entrances to these central branches, thereby causing more of the mixture to enter the same than would have without the deflecting means. In a similar manner the wall opposite the branch next removed from the inlet on each side thereof is formed with a deflecting surface, the wall being bulged out as at 21 for this purpose. The wall at 21, however, is not bulged out as much as at 201, as it is not necessary to deflect the gas stream as much opposite these latter branches as opposite the central ones. As shown in the drawings, no deflecting means is provided for the end branches. The ends of the header may be closed in any desired manner as by the screw plugs 22.</blockquote>

From the specification, however, it may be deduced that this wall is flat or substantially so. Starting at the bottom of page 3 we read the following: “ The wall of the header opposite the inlet 14 is inclined as at 20,” but 20 does not appear in a direct line opposite the inlet, and it is to be noted that “ the wall opposite the inlet ” refers to the whole top wall of the manifold. If it'is inclined at 20, it must be straight, or substantially so, directly opposite the inlet. If the wall is flat or substantially flat, then there can be no question but what claim 19 will read directly on the Vincent disclosure.</blockquote>

This license was issued upon a pending application in the Patent Office filed September <em>17, </em>1921, and which, upon a continuation application, became Swan, serial No. 1536044, dated April 28, 1925, and which is referred to in the case at bar. The header shown in Swan’s application was rectangular throughout. The defendant perfected and used another header, acting upon the same principles, but round instead of rectangular, and claimed this was not covered by Swan’s patent or claims. The court held otherwise, stating that in his opinion the gist of Swan’s invention was the deflection of the stream of incoming gases at right angles to the line of entrance thereof, in all directions, and that a round pipe would do this equally as well as a square one.</p>
