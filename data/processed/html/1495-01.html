Plydrogen dissolved in the steel is removed by casting at pressures of about 5 mm of Hg, which removal prevents flaking of the steel during cooling of forgings. The reference lists, in addition to preventing flaking, other advantages of vacuum casting. The steel described in Proceedings, closest in Mn and Si content to that used in appellants’ process, contains 0.63% Mn and 0.38% Si.</p>

We are unimpressed by this argument as a basis for patentability for the reason that the Proceedings reference clearly discloses similar improvements as being obtained by the vacuum casting process. * * ⅜ Appellants point out that the Proceedings reference is referring to “high alloy” steels. This may be the case, but we are of the opinion that it would be obvious to those skilled in the art to try with any particular steel a casting process which had been found, as in the Proceedings, to be successful in improving mechanical properties of another steel. * * *</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b817-6" data-blocks='[["BL_817.7",817,[113,903,1322,241]]]'>While, in the view we take of the case, we consider the composition of the steel not to be the controlling factor in evaluating patentability of the appealed claims because, in our opinion, it would be obvious to apply the vacuum casting process to any steel, we note, as the Examiner points out, that Oomptes Rendus discloses vacuum casting of a steel having manganese and silicon contents within the claimed range.</blockquote>
    <p id="b817-7" data-blocks='[["BL_817.8",817,[154,1168,941,43]]]'>Appellants in their brief consider the issue thus:</p>
    <blockquote id="b817-8" data-blocks='[["BL_817.9",817,[111,1238,1324,366]]]'>This appears to be the crucial issue, namely that appellants have surprisingly found that vacuum casting of steel of a defined composition gives vastly superior results as compared with vacuum casting of other steel compositions, and that the Board of Appeals takes the position that once vacuum casting of steel was disclosed for any type of steel even if the composition thereof might be greatly different from that of the steel composition according to the appealed claims, no patentable significance could be attached to the vacuum casting of a specific steel composition even though surprisingly superior results might be obtained thereby.</blockquote>
    <p id="b817-9" data-blocks='[["BL_817.10",817,[110,1630,1325,649]]]'>We find no reversible error in the board’s decision. Although appellants characterize their process and its results as “surprising” we fail to see that appellants have done anything unobvious to one skilled in this art. A fair reading of the Proceedings reference shows that vacuum casting is a technique of general applicability in casting steels and the reference points out that “The mechanical properties are likely to be influenced by the vacuum treatment; firstly, by reducing defects and improving purity in connection with the reduction of oxygen values.” Assuming, arguendo, that appellants’ steel is “superior” in mechanical properties at high temperatures, we are not convinced that such superiority results from anything unobvious in the process claimed. Vacuum casting is admittedly old and the art teaches that better mechanical properties result from such casting alone.</p>

    <p id="b817-11" data-blocks='[["BL_817.12",817,[154,2435,683,44]]]'>The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em>
