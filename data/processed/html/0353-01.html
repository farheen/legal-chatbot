(“Wells Fargo”) to acquire First Interstate Bancorp (“First Interstate”). The factual background and procedural history of the litigation are discussed in detail in earlier opinions of this court. <em>See In re First Interstate Bancorp Consolidated Shareholder Litig., </em>Del.

(“FBS”) previously approved by them, and entered into a merger agreement with Wells Fargo. Plaintiffs contend that this series of actions resulted in a benefit to the First Interstate stockholders measured in the billions of dollars.</p>

Discussions took place but no agreement was reached because plaintiffs' counsel, as a group, were unable to agree that the remaining “non-moot” claims should be abandoned as worthless. Among other things, those claims attacked the authorization of severance packages to officers and employees of First Interstate and the terms of a settlement reached between First Interstate and FBS pursuant to which FBS was paid $250 million in connection with the termination of the First Interstate/FBS merger agreement. Thus, further litigation ensued, led by those counsel who objected to the abandonment of the claims. Eventually, those claims were dismissed. <em>See In re First Interstate, </em>Del.

    <p id="b390-9" data-blocks='[["BL_390.10",390,[1009,1497,751,1032]]]'>The grant or denial of counsel fees lies within the sound discretion of the court. <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Dann, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/223/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="223 A.2d 384" data-case-ids="8103175" data-case-paths="/a2d/223/0384-01">223 A.2d 384</a>, 386 (1966). Defendants argue strenuously that the litigation was not “meritorious” when filed and that the actions of the defendant First Interstate directors, said to have mooted the plaintiffs’ claims, were not caused by the litigation. They also argue that, in any event, the causal relationship between the litigation and the resulting increase in value to the stockholders was so attenuated that the amount of that “benefit,” however measured, is not an appropriate reference point for determining a reasonable fee. Rather, they urge, any fee paid should be calculated on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis, compensating only for the time reasonably and productively spent on the litigation effort.</p>
    <p id="ANry" data-blocks='[["BL_390.11",390,[1008,2573,749,188]],["BL_391.1",391,[135,248,751,482]]]'>I will address each of these points. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to resolve a more basic dispute. If a fee is to be paid, where will the money come from <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>to pay it? The issue is important because, if the recovery can be obtained only from the “common fund” represented by the increased consideration paid to the First Interstate stockholders, then no recovery is possible because that fund was disbursed to them several years ago. In contrast, if an award can be recovered from First Interstate, a source of recovery exists.</p>

    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[133,914,754,1530]]]'>The “common fund” and the “corporate benefit” doctrines are, of course, two commonly recognized exceptions to the general, so-called American Rule, under which a prevailing party is responsible for the payment of its own counsel fees. “Under the common fund doctrine, a litigant who confers a common monetary benefit upon an ascertainable class is entitled to an allowance for fees and expenses to be paid from the fund or property which his efforts have created. Alternatively, the corporate benefit doctrine comes into play when a tangible monetary benefit has not been conferred,” but some other valuable benefit is realized by the corporate enterprise or the stockholders as a group. <em>In re Dunkin’ Donuts Shareholders Litig., </em>Del. Ch., Cons.C.A. No. 10825, <a href="/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20189120" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1990 WL 189120">1990 WL 189120</a>, Chandler, V.C., mem. op. at 7 (Nov. 27, 1990) (citations omitted). Plaintiffs contend that their litigation efforts either gave rise to a common fund on the basis of which fees may be awarded or, alternatively, benefited First Interstate shareholders “on the entity level” so as to justify an award of fees against the corporation. They also argue that grounds exist to estop First Interstate from denying its liability to pay whatever fee may be awarded.</p>

Where a case has been litigated to a conclusion or settled, the nature of the “benefit” and its causal connection to the litigation is ordinarily clear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In moot cases, these issues may be less easily resolved. <em>Compare Rosenthal v.

As may be inferred from <em>Take-Care II, </em>identifying the “benefit” claimed and the relation of that benefit to the claims asserted in the litigation can be a particularly nettlesome task where stockholder litigation is (i) brought in the midst of a fluid course of events, such as an ongoing takeover contest, and (ii) rendered “moot” when the defendants take action that brings the contest to a conclusion on terms satisfactory to the stockholder plaintiffs but before any result is obtained in the litigation. <em>See In re Dunkin’ Donuts, </em>Del.

Here, for example, a prominent claim rendered moot by the defendants’ actions related to the First Interstate rights plan. Such a claim, when asserted by stockholders not themselves participating in a proxy contest or tender <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>offer, is usually regarded as derivative in nature. <em>Moran v.

From this, one might suppose that the benefit conferred here was also derivative in nature and that fees should be paid out of the corporate treasury. Nevertheless, there is ample authority for the proposition that litigation similar to this may result in an award of fees out of the consideration paid to stockholders, rather than the corporate treasury. <em>See, e.g., TakeCare II, </em>Del. Ch., <a href="/a2d/727/0844-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="727 A.2d 844" data-case-ids="11631585" data-case-paths="/a2d/727/0844-01">727 A.2d at </a>847 n. 2 (noting that, pursuant to stipulation, funds were withheld from the total consideration paid to stockholders as a source to pay fee award); <em>In re Dunkin’ Donuts, </em>Del.

Conversely, there is authority for the proposition that where individual or class litigation results in the conferral of an unquantified benefit on the stockholders as a whole, the corporation may be hable to pay fees. <em>Richman v.

Primarily, their complaint sought injunctive relief constraining the operation of certain aspects of the First Interstate/FBS merger agreement and compelling the defendant directors to act in accordance with their fiduciary duties in responding to the hostile takeover effort mounted by Wells Fargo. Ultimately, the directors acted to abandon the First Interstate/FBS merger agreement and to enter into a superior merger agreement with Wells Fargo. Assuming, for the purpose of this argument, some causal relationship between the litigation and these actions, the litigation may be seen to have benefited the First Interstate stockholders, as a whole, in some unquantifiable, but nonetheless real, sense.

The fundamental rationale relied on in <em>In re Dunkin’ Donuts </em>to deny an award of fees to Kings-bridge was its status as a defeated competing bidder for control of the corporation. Del. Ch., Cons.C.A. No. 10825. Thus, at page 19, the opinion states: “I cannot say that [Kingsbridge] directly conferred a benefit upon the stockholder class in the same sense as the class plaintiffs, for the simple reason that Kingsbridge’s efforts were not aimed at securing a-sale of Dun-kin’ Donuts to the highest bidder. Rather, Kingsbridge’s lawsuit was but one element of its strategy to acquire the target.... It is ... Kingsbridge’s position as a bidder for control of Dunkin’ Donuts that undercuts its claim for fees and expenses.” Later, at page 20, it is observed that “[t]his Court has never compensated a shareholder for costs incurred in litigation related to [its] attempt to acquire a corporation.” The court also determined that fee shifting in the case of defeated bidders was unnecessary and undesirable as a matter of policy. <em>Id. </em>at 21-24. Finally, to the extent the decision in <em>In re Dunkin’ Donuts </em>reflects a determination that the winning bidder, who had acquired 100% of Dunkin’ Donuts for cash, should not have to bear the litigation expenses of others involved in the takeover contest, those concerns are not present (or at least less important) here for the following reasons, among others: (a) the fee application at issue is not made by a competing bidder, (b) the acquisition of First Interstate was for stock, not cash, and thus, the current stockholders of Wells Fargo are, in some substantial degree, former stockholders of First Interstate or their successors in interest, and (c) as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>there is some evidence suggesting that Wells Fargo expected that First Interstate would be required to pay a fee to plaintiffs’ counsel. Together, these factors convince me that <em>In re Dunkin’ Donuts </em>does not preclude a fee award from First Interstate.</p>

I recognize that, in cases where plaintiffs’ litigation efforts result in or contribute to the creation of a fund distributed to a class, it is generally appropriate that any fee award should be paid out of that fund. This is, perhaps, particularly so where the litigation is part of an ongoing process by which the corporate entity is acquired and its shareholders paid for their shares. Nevertheless, fee shifting is an equitable device and, as the circumstances presented here demonstrate, is not properly or easily confined to rigid, predictable circumstances. Here, it is more fair to require First Interstate to pay a fee to plaintiffs’ counsel than to deny them any fee at all. Because no other source of payment is available, this court will regard the assets of First Interstate as “being a fund belonging to the stockholders in common” <em>(Richman, </em>Del.

Because Wells Fargo itself benefited from plaintiffs’ support of its position during the litigation and for the other reasons already articulated in this opinion, this result should not cause Wells Fargo, as the acquirer of First Interstate, the sort of prejudice recognized in <em>In </em>re <em>Dunkin’ Donuts.</em>

I also reject the suggestion that <em>all </em>of the time reportedly spent by those law firms involved in the California litigation but not formally part of these consolidated cases must be disallowed. Obviously, time spent in connection with the pleadings and motion practice (including briefing and court appearances) in those cases produced no benefit to the class and will not be compensated. Just as clearly, time spent on discovery matters, such as document review and depositions did produce a benefit because those efforts were coordinated with the efforts of Delaware counsel and, according to the record before me, were largely non-duplicative. Adjusting the reported hours to eliminate non-compensable time spent in the California litigation, I arrive at rough totals of time devoted to the matter by attorneys and paralegals, respectively, of 2,928 and 912 hours.

The argument is made that, due in part to plaintiffs’ litigation efforts, the stockholders of First Interstate received greater value in the acquisition of their shares then would otherwise have been the case. Thus, the "fund” is some part of the total consideration paid by Wells Fargo to acquire the First Interstate stock. Leaving aside issues of causation, this is essentially the same argument made, and accepted, in <em>TakeCare I, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/693/1076-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="693 A.2d 1076" data-case-ids="12004669" data-case-paths="/a2d/693/1076-01">693 A.2d 1076</a>, and <em>II, </em>Del.

Plaintiffs suggest that the amount of the "fund” created by their litigation efforts can be measured one of two ways: first, as the difference in value between the market capitalization of First Interstate on October 16, 1995, the day before the announcement of Wells Fargo’s original proposal and the aggregate value of the merger consideration as of January 23, 1996, the day the merger agreement with Wells Fargo was approved, or approximately $3.5 billion; or second, they suggest that the "fund” can be measured as the difference between the overall value of the original Wells Fargo proposal as of October 17, 1995, and the value of the aggregate merger consideration as of January 23, 1996, or approximately $1.4 billion. I am not convinced that either of these measures adequately reflects the value of whatever "fund” might be thought to have been created by the litigation. On a per share basis, the first measures the entire "premium” between the unaffected First Interstate market price and the value of the final Wells Fargo proposal. Yet the litigation had nothing to do with Wells Fargo making a premium offer. The second, in substantial part, reflects the fact that during the pendency of the Wells Fargo exchange offer the market price of its shares increased, thus making greater the value of the Wells Fargo shares being offered in exchange. Again, I do not regard the litigation as having anything to do with that increase in value. I also do not think it is appropriate to measure the "fund” by reference to the difference in value between the First Interstate/FBS merger and the Wells Fargo deal, if only because the evidence strongly suggests that the latter would not have been approved by the First Interstate stockholders.</p>

In their letter to the court dated July 12, 1999, plaintiffs’ counsel characterize the procedural steps taken in this litigation in February 1996, <em>i.e. </em>the defendants’ stipulation to plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and plaintiffs’ acquiescence in defendants’ motion for summary judgment, as evidencing "cooperative step[s] in furtherance of dismissal of the litigation.” Defendants hotly contest that either of these actions is reflective of any agreement between the parties. I conclude that there was no agreement among the parties relative to these actions.</p>
