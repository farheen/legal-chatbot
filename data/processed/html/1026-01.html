    <blockquote id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[107,727,1328,159]]]'>Claims 13 and 14 are too broad because applicants describe only one precipitate and describe this precipitate as critically related to their invention.

    <p id="b347-7" data-blocks='[["BL_347.7",347,[107,909,1328,451]]]'>It is quite true that appellants’ specification calls for the extraction of duodenal mucosa with a “suitable solvent,” but it is likewise true that the only solvent disclosed by the application to be suitable is calcium acid phosphate. There is no evidence in the record, as stated by the board, that a useful product would result from the precipitation of calcium phosphate from <em>any </em>solution which contained the desired hormone. On this phase of the appeal we are of opinion that the case of <em>In re </em>Ferris, 24 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1303, 1305, <a href="/ccpa/24-2/1303-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="90 F.2d 363" data-case-ids="6082842,978678" data-case-paths="/ccpa/24-2/1303-01,/f2d/90/0363-01">90 F. (2d) 363</a>, is squarely in point. In that case we said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.8",347,[104,1383,1330,453]]]'>It will be noticed that the claims call broadly for the step of bringing a solvent into intimate contact with the oil without mentioning the particular solvent employed. It seems to us that appellant’s invention as taught in the patent was the use of nitro-benzene or its equivalent belonging to the group of nitro compounds or mixtures, and that appellant now seeks to acquire a patent with claims which involve the use of any kind of solvent which would do the work regardless of whether or not it is of the type disclosed. The appealed ■claims themselves are so broad in calling for a solvent as to amount to asking a monopoly on treating oils for the purposes stated with any material which has a solvent characteristic. The claims are really so broad that they state only the desired result and say that it can be done with a solvent.</blockquote>
    <p id="b347-9" data-blocks='[["BL_347.9",347,[105,1860,1329,193]]]'>We are, therefore, of opinion that the aforesaid added reason for rejection by the board of process claims 8,9,15 and 16, on the grounds that the said claims are broader than any invention described in the application, was proper and we so hold.</p>
    <p id="b347-10" data-blocks='[["BL_347.10",347,[107,2060,1324,143]]]'>As to appealed process claims 13 and 14 the reason for rejection added by the board was that the precipitate is too broadly stated in these claims. In both of these claims the following appears:</p>
    <blockquote id="b347-11" data-blocks='[["BL_347.11",347,[106,2231,1324,115]]]'>* * *, the steps of precipitating in a solution containing the insular hormone of the duodenal mucosa a precipitate which adsorbs said hormone and separating said precipitate and adsorbed hormone from the solution.</blockquote>
    <p id="b347-13" data-blocks='[["BL_347.12",347,[104,2370,1327,94]],["BL_348.1",348,[220,247,1328,240]]]'>It is clear that the term “a precipitate” is broad enough to include any or all precipitates which can produce the result desired. The <a id="p1030" href="#p1030" data-label="1030" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1030</a>sole example of a precipitate disclosed in the specification of appellants is phosphate of calcium. Since claims 13 and 14 do not state that the precipitate is phosphate of calcium they are certainly broader than the alleged invention and were properly rejected by the board for that reason.</p>
    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[269,499,969,46]]]'>With respect to claims 2 and 12 the board said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[220,569,1326,324]]]'>Claims 2 and 12 describe the extract by its effects only. We do not believe these claims point out the invention as required by law and, as indicated above, extracts of this character have been known for years, although the prior art does not point out that they are free from all the substances mentioned in claim 2 and Heller clearly indicates the presence of histamine in his extract and the absence of proteins. The mere absence of certain impurities does not render an old extract patentable unless possibly the absence of these impurities is a critical feature of the invention, which does not appear to be the case here.</blockquote>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[219,919,1326,386]]]'>Extracts of duodenal mucosa containing its hormone, are shown to be old in the art of pharmacology. A careful examination of the Heller reference of 1929 shows that Heller prepared an extract of duodenal mucosa having substantially the same properties as the product shown by claims 2 and 12 herein. The preparation of Heller had the property of reducing the blood sugar level and even when orally administered to dogs which had not been depancreatized, it had this effect.</p>
    <p id="b348-7" data-blocks='[["BL_348.7",348,[218,1321,1326,442]]]'>We are of opinion that the extract of Heller was not of the nature of insulin as contended by appellants since Heller shows that insulin orally administered is destroyed by the ferments in the intestines and has no effect on the blood sugar level when so administered. Neither can we agree with the contention of appellants that the product of Heller is of the nature of secretin, as Heller evidently distinguished secretin from his extract, saying “The active principle is therefore found, <em>just the same as for seeretioi, </em>in the duodenum and the proximal jejunum.” [Italics supplied.]</p>
    <p id="b348-8" data-blocks='[["BL_348.8",348,[215,1771,1328,445]]]'>The properties and tests of Heller indicate that his product is substantially protein free, although some histamine is present. In view of Heller it appears to us that if there is any difference between that product and the extract of appellants it is merely one of slight degree of purity. We do not believe this difference of degree in purity renders the product of appellants patentable, for the reason that the products of appellants and Heller do not differ in kind nor does appellants’ product have a new utility not possessed by Heller. <em>In re Merz, </em>25 C.
