McGill had been a boarder at Phillips’ home until the previous week, at which time Phillips asked McGill to move out of her house. McGill arrived at the residence and knocked on the door. Phillips opened the door and McGill informed her that he had returned to get his clothes. Phillips acknowledged the request, closed the door, and proceeded upstairs to retrieve McGill’s belongings.</p>

Forte attempted to give McGill a bag of clothes, but McGill punched her in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. A violent struggle ensued between Forte and McGill, during which McGill brandished a knife, punched, kicked, and stabbed Forte. McGill then grabbed Forte by the hair and <a id="p1017" href="#p1017" data-label="1017" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1017</a>dragged her into the kitchen. Phillips screamed and begged McGill to stop and leave. McGill told Phillips to “[S]hut up [before] I put this knife in your back.... ” (Notes of Testimony (N.T.) 7/21/92, page 65).</p>
    <p id="b1073-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1073.4",1073,[139,631,752,640]]]'>McGill then proceeded to bind the wrists of Forte with cord and pulled down her pantyhose. Forte pleaded with McGill not to rape her; McGill responded by punching and kicking her in the head until she lost consciousness. At some point thereafter, while Forte was still unconscious, McGill severely beat Phillips, who was seventy-two years old at the time. In addition to punching Phillips, McGill repeatedly struck her in the head with a metal file. He struck Phillips with such force that the handle of the file broke off.</p>
    <p id="b1073-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1073.5",1073,[139,1303,752,1162]]]'>When Forte regained consciousness, McGill returned to the room where she was tied up; he accused her of faking. He repeatedly choked, punched, and kicked Forte, complaining that she would not die. McGill then struck Forte over the head with a glass ketchup bottle, causing the bottle to break. Forte pretended to be unconscious in the hope that McGill would believe that she had died. McGill then left the scene. Forte remained still for several minutes in order to ensure that McGill was in fact gone. She then went to the house of a neighbor to call the police. Both victims were taken to a local hospital. Phillips died as a result of her injuries within an hour of reaching the hospital. Original Record, Trial Memorandum, page 1. Forte spent three days in intensive care and another three days in general recovery. While in the hospital, she identified McGill as her assailant from a photographic array.</p>

While in police custody, McGill confessed to the crime, stating that he went to Phillips’ house with the intention of stealing money to purchase drugs. He admitted that he punched and struck Phillips in the head with a metal file. He further acknowledged that, after beating the two women, he stole two hundred dollars from the purse of Phillips and spent all the monies on cocaine.</p>

At the conclusion of the penalty phase hearing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance, that McGill killed Phillips while in the perpetration of a felony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and no mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv), the trial court set the sentence at death. On March 23, 1993, the court permitted Gerald Ingram, Esquire (trial counsel), to withdraw and appointed new counsel, Jeremy Ibrahim, Esquire (appellate counsel). McGill filed post-verdict motions, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of trial <a id="p1018" href="#p1018" data-label="1018" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1018</a>counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the post-verdict motions and imposed the death sentence. The trial court also sentenced McGill to a consecutive term of ten to twenty years for the aggravated assault and a concurrent term of five to ten years for possession of an instrument of crime.

On February 5, 1998, McGill filed supplemental affidavits and exhibits in support of the claims raised in his Petition. By Order dated March 18, 1998, the PCRA court dismissed McGill’s PCRA Petition without a hearing. On March 26, 1998, McGill filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court. Unfortunately, the PCRA court judge, the Honorable Eugene H. Clark, Jr. (Judge Clark), passed away before he had the opportunity to write his opinion ancillary to dismissing the PCRA Petition. We remanded the matter to the PCRA court for the drafting of an opinion in support of the Order denying the PCRA Petition. On July 30, 2001, the PCRA court, by the Honorable Judge Benjamin Lerner (Judge Lerner), filed an Opinion in support of Judge Clark’s denial of PCRA relief.</p>

However, McGill fails to explain how resolution of this issue entitles him to any relief. In its Opinion, the PCRA court did not dismiss the penalty phase claims as not cognizable; instead, the court discussed the procedural bars of previous litigation and waiver, as well as the merits of the claims. While McGill makes a valid and accurate argument in this regard, nonetheless, it does not afford him a basis for relief.</p>

(Notes of Testimony, April 13, 1994, pages 30-31.) Therefore, trial counsel had no reason to believe that the court-appointed psychologist would have interpreted these records differently. Additionally, as the PCRA court stated, trial counsel feared raising such a defense because it would allow the Commonwealth to introduce the statement of Bilal, that McGill admitted to a strategy of pretending to be suffering from psychosis, in rebuttal. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. Accordingly, McGill has failed to establish that trial counsel did not have a reasonable basis for not providing the court-appointed psychologist with the medical records, all of which indicated that he did not suffer from any psychiatric impairment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

    <p id="b1081-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1081.7",1081,[941,311,755,760]]]'>McGill also asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate fully, possible mitigating circumstances for his penalty phase. The Opinion of the PCRA court denies this claim, reasoning that McGill did not present any evidence in his PCRA petition to support it. Accordingly, the PCRA court determined that McGill failed to proffer sufficient facts from which a court could determine that trial counsel was ineffective and that, therefore, he could not establish the arguable merit prong of his layered ineffectiveness claim as to the representation of appellate counsel.</p>

On February 5, 1998, McGill filed affidavits from Dr. Alan Tep-per (Dr. Tepper) and Dr. Julie Kessler (Dr. Kessler), two clinical and forensic psychologists who evaluated McGill in 1991 and 1992, and Dr. Harry Krop (Dr. Krop), a licensed neuropsychologist. Dr. Tepper averred that he saw McGill at the request of trial counsel, but that trial counsel never discussed with him the possible presentation of mental health evidence in mitigation during the penalty phase of McGill’s trial. Dr. Kessler, who, as medical director of the Norristown State Hospital, assessed the competency of McGill to stand trial, stated that trial counsel never contacted her to learn of potentially relevant mitigating mental health evidence. Dr. Krop, who evaluated McGill in late January of 1998 while the PCRA Petition was pending, diagnosed McGill with organic brain damage, chronic schizophrenia, and explained that “substantial mental health mitigating evidence could have been presented to the jury at the time of <a id="p1026" href="#p1026" data-label="1026" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1026</a>[McGill’s] capital proceedings.” Affidavit of Dr. Krop at 5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

The PCRA court properly dismissed the PCRA Petition of McGill in all but one respect — on these claims, we affirm the Order of the PCRA court. However, on the final claim, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate fully and present mitigating mental health evidence, we cannot adequately review the propriety of the Order of the PCRA court because the PCRA court mischaracterized the record as being devoid of any evidence to support McGill’s contention. Accordingly, we vacate the Order of the PCRA court to the extent that it dismissed this claim of McGill. We remand the matter to the PCRA court to consider the affidavits and medical records McGill submitted to the PCRA court in February of 1998.</p>
