An analysis of claim 1 in the light of the cited prior art discloses that all aspects of the “comb foundation support for a beehive” are shown in the Hartman reference except for the specific retaining means for holding the foundation web in the slot in the upper horizontal member of the frame. The retaining means, in the language of claim 1, comprises:</p>

    <p id="b901-7" data-blocks='[["BL_901.7",901,[140,1481,1328,91]]]'>This analysis accords with the statement in appellant’s specification that:</p>

Appellant’s invention relates to novel fastening means used in beehives. It is alleged that a problem existed in the support of honeycomb foundations which appellant solved. While this <em>'problem </em>would be encountered by a beeheeper, we think the problem naturally calls for the talents of one skilled in the art of fasteners. Under section 103 we must look to the person of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains, not those who may use the invention.
