At about the same time, she contracted a blood disease for which she was hospitalized and received transfusions. These things, she said, “took priority over me finding a computer and a setup to respond to the written responses, once I did get them from Bar Counsel.” She further testified that she was “now fully prepared to devote whatever time is necessary ... to respond to any requests .... ”</p>

Similarly, the hearing committee was not required to credit Ms. Lea for giving Bar Counsel her mother’s address in Pennsylvania because she either ignored the mail sent to that address or failed to ensure that it reached her in a timely manner.

In that case we held that “[e]ven in a single investigation, an attorney’s disregard for the disciplinary process may be so repeated, deliberate, and prolonged that a requirement to prove fitness is entirely justified.” <em>Godette I, </em><a href="/a2d/919/1157-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="919 A.2d 1157" data-case-ids="8329887" data-case-paths="/a2d/919/1157-01">919 A.2d at 1167</a>.

Here we have “input” from the respondent which was lacking in <em>Go-dette. </em>Ms. Lea testified at some length by telephone, but the hearing committee did not credit what she had to say. Since the committee’s credibility findings were not clearly erroneous, the Board was bound to accept them. There is no room here for the Board to “speculate” that Ms. Lea’s evasion of service, like that of Mr. Godette, may have been motivated by “hopelessness and perhaps despair.”</p>

In particular, given that substantial evidence supported the committee’s credibility findings,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> the Board erred in failing to accept those findings. <em>See Temple, </em><a href="/a2d/629/1203-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="629 A.2d 1203" data-case-ids="7371797" data-case-paths="/a2d/629/1203-01">629 A.2d at 1208-1209</a> (holding that as long as the findings are supported by substantial evidence, the Board must defer to the hearing committee’s credibility determinations because they are “subsidiary findings of basic facts”). The committee found that Ms. Lea’s testimony, tone, and behavior demonstrated a lack of contrition or appreciation for the seriousness of her conduct. The Board argues, however, that Ms. Lea’s testimony demonstrated that she suffered from a “mental block” regarding the Rule 11 order, not a lack of contrition or appreciation for the seriousness of the matter, and that this block “does not translate to an inability to practice law.” The Board also asserts that the committee did not make “true credibility findings” because Ms. Lea participated in the hearing only by telephone, and that the com<a id="p894" href="#p894" data-label="894" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*894</a>mittee therefore could not directly observe her demeanor.</p>
    <p id="b922-4" data-blocks='[["BL_922.4",922,[193,437,755,1748]]]'>The Board appears to overlook the fact that Ms. Lea was not physically present at the hearing because, as she admitted, she overslept and had another appointment scheduled for 12:30 p.m. that same day. The hearing committee was free to draw from such behavior reasonable conclusions about her appreciation of the seriousness of the disciplinary process; in other words, her absence was itself an evidentiary fact that the committee could properly consider. It is of course true that the hearing committee’s ability to make credibility determinations is “at its zenith” when the witness is physically present. Nevertheless, regardless of whether the evidence at the hearing consists of face-to-face testimony, testimony by telephone, or something else <em>{e.g., </em>a deposition or an affidavit), the Board can disregard the committee’s factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous, and in this case they are not. <em>See Godette I, </em><a href="/a2d/919/1157-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="919 A.2d 1157" data-case-ids="8329887" data-case-paths="/a2d/919/1157-01">919 A.2d at 1164</a>. We are satisfied that in light of Ms. Lea’s testimony, her conduct on the day of the hearing, and her entire history of unresponsiveness, there was substantial evidence supporting the hearing committee’s finding that Ms. Lea did not appreciate the seriousness of the disciplinary process. Therefore, the committee’s credibility findings were not clearly erroneous and should have been accepted by the Board.</p>

Under the current version of this court’s Rules Governing the Bar, it is not always necessary for Bar Counsel to file a formal petition instituting a disciplinary proceeding when an attorney fails to cooperate with an investigation. An amendment to D.C. Bar Rule XI, § 3(c)(1), which took effect in August 2008, authorizes the Board (presumably after a request from Bar Counsel) to seek from this court an order temporarily suspending an attorney for “failing] to respond to an order of the Board in a matter where Bar Counsel's investigation involves allegations of serious misconduct.” The next sentence defines "serious misconduct” to include "fraud, dishonesty, misappropriation, commingling, overdraft of trust accounts, criminal conduct other than criminal contempt, or instances of neglect that establish a pattern of misconduct in the pending investigation.” We express no opinion here on whether Ms. Lea’s conduct would constitute "serious misconduct” under this definition. We simply take note of the 2008 amendment to the rule as providing to Bar Counsel an alternative means of dealing with an attorney's failure to respond to a disciplinary complaint.</p>
