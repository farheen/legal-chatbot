    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[229,624,752,949]]]'>Certainly, although Asa F. York was not one of the organizers of the Plaintiff corporation, the fact that it was organized, as its certificate recites, in his grain store, that its corporate name memorialized his late wife, and that it owned no physical assets until it received his bequest, strongly suggests his original interest in it. The decision to use the words “Orphan Asylum” in the new corporation’s name unquestionably reflects their — and, doubtless his— aspiration that the corporation might some day perform the particular charitable service suggested by its name. In anticipation of that desire, the organizers provided for the order of preference in the admission of children to the hoped-for institution in Article VI of the Bylaws. The Bylaws make no other reference to the operation of a home.</p>

He could have referred — but did not — to the Bylaws instead of the corporate purposes in describing the purposes of the trust. The fact that he chose to make his bequest in trust “for the purposes of said corporation”, instead of for the more limited purpose of operation of a home for orphans, indicates to us a broad purpose of rendering assistance to destitute children, especially those without parents. His decision to create this trust in the residuary clause, with no provision for a reversion in case of impossibility of performance by the Trustees, is especially indicative that the intent was not to limit the bequest to the operation of an asylum which he must have realized might prove to be beyond the capability of the Trustees.

Pleadings filed in another action are not included in the stipulation as to matters which the Court should consider.

There may be honest differences of opinion among persons of good judgment as to whether it is wise to use real estate in a particular way for its direct effect in promoting the purposes for which an educational corporation was established.

In view of the broad nature of the relief which Mr. York intended to afford destitute children, we conclude that “instruction” was intended to include such education as would be appropriate for the needs of the individual child in the discretion of the Trustees. We do not find in the purposes of the trust an intention that assistance in education to such children — if worthy — should be terminated at any particular scholastic level.</p>

While the Plaintiff’s duty is to carry out Mr. York’s purposes by the appropriate use of the income of the trust, and while the purposes are the relief of indigent children through trust moneys, circumstances may on occasion properly convince the Trustees that the purposes can better be implemented by prudent reinvestment of part of the income than by its entire expenditure on available programs.</p>
