At his arraignment, he was ordered held without bail pending a Harnish hearing on the burglary count, which the State characterized as a formerly capital offense for which no bail was available.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <em>See </em>15 M.R.S.A. § 1027. The District Court (Pres-que Isle, <em>Griffiths, J.) </em>subsequently held a Harnish hearing on the burglary charge, heard the state’s motion to revoke bail on previous charges, and held a bail hearing on the two attempted murder charges and the aggravated assault charge. The court concluded that Argraves had committed a formerly capital offense and ordered him held without bail. It revoked his $400.00 cash bail on previous charges of assault, terrorizing and criminal mischief, and set bail for the two counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault at $50,000 double sureties or 50% cash. 15 M.R.S.A. § 1026.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The court declined to alter the bail as set on the other charges. The State filed a motion for clarification and to reconsider, which the court granted. After a hearing, the Superior Court reversed its previous decision and ruled that burglary was a formerly capital offense.</p>

Sec. 5501 and Petition for Review of Bail Pursuant to M.Crim.P. Rule 46(d)” setting forth claims relating to denial of bail on the burglary charge, revocation of bail, and excessive bail. A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, in his order of December 19, 1994, ruled that Argraves was not entitled to further review of bail.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The single justice did not refer to any petition for habeas corpus in his order. Despite the label on defendant’s pleading, a proper petition for a writ of habe-as corpus was never filed with the court. See Glassman, <em>Maine Practice: Rules of Criminal Procedure Annotated </em>at 462 (1967). Moreover, there is no provision in the Maine Bail Code permitting review by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of a bail determination made initially in the District Court. Such bail determinations may only be appealed to the Superior Court.</p>
