Evidence was presented that both parents had been convicted of gross sexual misconduct toward their children. The District Court (Bangor, <em>Russell, J.) </em>ordered termination of their parental rights and this appeal by the parents followed. We affirm the judgment.</p>

It is illogical, however, to maintain that a presumption becomes conclusive simply because a person against whom it is applied has offered no evidence with which to rebut it.

    <p id="b105-11" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[163,589,746,697]]]'>Furthermore, the presumption furthers the compelling state interest of permanently placing abused children in stable homes at the earliest possible time and protecting children from parents who have abused them by allowing the proceeding to be completed more efficiently, more quickly and less expensively. It also minimizes the danger that the children will have to again testify. The use of the rebuttable presumption, therefore, did not deprive the parents of due process. Likewise, because the presumption furthers a compelling state interest, there was no equal protection violation.</p>
