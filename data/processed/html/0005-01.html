    <p id="b41-21" data-blocks='[["BL_41.22",41,[955,1166,754,940]]]'>¶ 1 Appellant, Marjorie Wolloch, has appealed from each of the five orders entering summary judgment in favor of Ap-pellees, Robert Aiken, M.D., Michelle Meltzer, M.D., Richard Keohane, M.D., Pennsylvania Hospital, and Thomas Jefferson Hospital, in Appellant’s medical malpractice case. Specifically, Appellant asks us- to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting Appellees’ motions for summary judgment. Following our review of the record in light of applicable law, we affirm summary judgment in favor of Appellees Keo-hane, Pennsylvania Hospital and Thomas Jefferson Hospital; we reverse the judgments in favor of Appellees Aiken and Meltzer, and remand for further proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b41-22" data-blocks='[["BL_41.23",41,[956,2129,755,438]],["BL_42.1",42,[198,257,751,386]]]'>¶2 The relevant facts and procedural history of this case as gleaned from the certified record on appeal are as follows. On or about June 4, 1992, Appellant came under the medical care of Appellee Melt-zer, complaining of intermittent throbbing pain in her left lower back with intermittent radiation of the pain down her left leg and ankle. Appellee Meltzer ordered a <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>cervical spine film, due to Appellant’s complaints of arm numbness, and a spine series. The films were taken at Pennsylvania Hospital and read by Appellee Keohane. The films were read as normal. Appellant was prescribed pain medications. Appellant continued under Appellee Meltzer’s care for only three weeks.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[194,667,754,1089]]]'>¶ 3 On or about June 24, 1992, Appellant consulted Appellee Aiken at Thomas Jefferson Hospital for complaints of intense discomfort relating to her left leg and ankle. Appellee Aiken diagnosed Appellant’s condition as lumbar radiculopathy and recommended pain medication, Naprosyn, heat, massage, and ultrasound. By September 1992, Appellant’s condition appeared to be improving on the Naprosyn and physical therapy regimen. On October 21, 1992, Appellee Aiken ordered a MRI of Appellant’s left spinal canal. The MRI indicated a minimal bulging at L4-5. Appellee Aiken referred Appellant to the Jefferson Pain Clinic for nerve block injections. Soon thereafter, Appellant began to experience radicular pain of increased and constant intensity. Appellant was treated with epidural steroids through December 1992. Appellant continued under Appellee Aiken’s care until January 1993.</p>
    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[194,1779,753,840]]]'>¶ 4 On January 26, 1993, Appellant underwent a radiographic film of her left hip. The next day, Appellant was admitted to the hospital with severe back and left leg pain and a fever of 102 degrees. X-rays showed a probable lesion. Appellant’s CT scan indicated a large mass, which arose in the left ilium and extended from the iliac joint to invade the sacrum. There was also some indication of pulmonary metastases. A bone scan indicated destruction of the left sacrum, left sacroiliac joint and medial portion of the ilium. A biopsy showed osteosarcoma. Her pelvic MRI showed a large mass arising in the left iliac bone, displacing local muscles, and extending into the abdominal cavity.</p>
    <p id="b42-7" data-blocks='[["BL_42.8",42,[997,257,752,832]]]'>¶ 5 Appellant underwent a program of aggressive chemotherapy and related treatment until July 1993. She was referred to UCLA Medical Center for a left hemipelvectomy and extensive related surgery, with post-operative chemotherapy recommended. Following her August 1993 stay at UCLA Medical Center, Appellant was admitted to Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia on September 3, 1993. Appellant continued a rigorous course of post-operative and rehabilitative treatment throughout 1994. By December 1994, Appellant’s test results indicated no evidence of recurrence, and her March 1995 films showed no metastases as of that date.</p>
    <p id="b42-8" data-blocks='[["BL_42.9",42,[995,1132,752,680]]]'>¶ 6 Appellant commenced this action by Writ of Summons on May 31, 1994. She filed her Complaint on June 25, 1994. In her Complaint, Appellant claimed that her treatment by all Appellees fell below the proper standard of medical care. As a result of Appellees’ failure to recognize Appellant’s symptoms and to diagnosis her condition, Appellant alleged, her diagnosis and treatment for cancer were inappropriately delayed, allowing her tumor to grow and causing Appellant increased pain and suffering, permanent disability, and other losses.</p>
    <p id="b42-9" data-blocks='[["BL_42.10",42,[996,1855,749,581]]]'>¶ 7 Appellees promptly filed preliminary objections to Appellant’s Complaint. The court overruled Appellees’ respective preliminary objections. Appellees’ Answers to Appellant’s Complaint were duly filed by January 1995. Discovery proceeded without incident by the parties’ voluntary and cooperative exchange of information through interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and depositions. Appellee Meltzer’s deposition was the last, taken in November 1997.</p>

      <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>as determined by the court term during which the Complaint had been filed. The case was listed for a case management conference, which was held on April 10, 1997. The case management order listed the case on the complex track, adopting the complex track time standards for discovery and other pretrial deadlines. According to that order, Appellant was required to identify her medical expert and to provide an expert report and curriculum vitae no later than February 2, 1998. Ap-pellees were to provide their expert information no later than April 6, 1998. As well, the case management order required all pretrial motions to be filed by April 6, 1998. Settlement memos were due by May 4, 1998; pretrial memos were due by May 18, 1998. The parties were directed to be ready for trial by August 3, 1998.</p>

Further, Appellant did not file a timely second Petition for Extraordinary Relief before March 2, 1998, by which she might have obtained another extension of the expert witness deadline. Accordingly, Appellee Aiken filed a motion for summary judgment on March 10, 1998, followed by motions for summary judgment on behalf of Appellee Pennsylvania Hospital, filed on March 17, 1998; Appellee Thomas Jefferson Hospital, filed on March 18,1998; Appellee Keo-hane, filed on March 19,1998; and, Appel-lee Meltzer, filed on March 20, 1998. The thrust of Appellees’ motions was that Appellant had failed to submit timely expert report(s) delineating the applicable standard of care; stating how Appellees had deviated from the acceptable standard of care; and, with the proper degree of medical certainty, that their deviation caused or contributed to Appellant’s alleged harm. Without an expert report, Appellees contended, Appellant could not make out a <em>prim a facie </em>case of medical malpractice.</p>
    <p id="b43-12" data-blocks='[["BL_43.9",43,[960,1328,757,588]]]'>¶ 11 In response, Appellant challenged only the motions for summary judgment of Appellees Aiken and Meltzer on April 13 and April 15, 1998, respectively. The gist of Appellant’s opposition was the alleged difficulty in obtaining an appropriate expert to review Appellant’s extensive treatment records. Appellant again requested an additional thirty days to supply the expert reports, admitting that counsel had seriously underestimated the time required to obtain the reports.</p>
    <p id="b43-13" data-blocks='[["BL_43.10",43,[961,1953,752,139]],["BL_44.1",44,[201,252,755,674]]]'>¶ 12 Importantly, in her answers in opposition to the motions for summary judgment filed by Appellees’ Aiken and Melt-<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>zer, Appellant explicitly stated that she did not intend to respond to the motions for summary judgment filed by Appellees Keohane, Pennsylvania Hospital and Thomas Jefferson Hospital. On April 14, 1998, Appellant also filed copies of her letters to counsel for these Appellees, advising the court that Appellant was not opposing the summary judgment motions of Appellee Keohane and the two hospitals. At no time in this flurry of dispositive motions did any party question the fundamental necessity of an expert opinion to support Appellant’s case.</p>

On May 4 and May 14, 1998, however, counsel for Appellant forwarded to Appellees’ counsel copies of two reports by Appellant’s expert, Richard S. Goodman, M.D. and a copy of his <em>curriculum vitae. </em>On May 20, 1998, Appellant’s counsel also forwarded to Appellees’ counsel a copy of the report of another expert, Donna Glover, M.D., along with a copy of her <em>curriculum vitas. ■</em>

Attached to her motion to vacate were copies of the expert reports and <em>curriculum vitae </em>previously forwarded to Appellees. In the motion to vacate, counsel for Appellant admitted that efforts to secure appropriate experts were first made in September 1997. Counsel claimed that the “enormous quantity of records requiring review” as well as the difficulty in obtaining experts who could review Appellant’s clinical records and render an informed opinion, had seriously hampered their efforts. Counsel also complained that, on March 24, 1995, the original x-ray films from June 5, 1992 had to be.returned to Pennsylvania Hospital and that Appellant had only copies of the films to submit to the expert for review. Counsel asserted that there had been no willful disregard of the discovery deadlines or prejudice to Appel-lees caused by the delay in providing Appellant’s experts’ reports. Counsel further stated that he had not received the court’s order granting his initial request for Extraordinary Relief until March 10, 1998, which was too late to file a timely second request for Extraordinary Relief from the March 2, 1998 deadline. Accordingly, Appellant asked the trial court to reconsider/vacate its summary judgment orders and to issue a new case management order. Realizing that the trial court would not address the motion for reconsideration until after Appellees had thirty days to respond, on May 22, 1998, Appellant filed appeals from the five orders granting summary judgment in favor of all Appellees.</p>

Appellees stated that they had complied with Appellant’s discovery requests and/or submitted to depositions. Appellees maintained that Appellant had been given ample time and <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>information to secure a proper expert and to submit a timely report, at least by the extended deadline of March 2, 1998. Ap-pellees concluded that Appellant’s failure to proceed with due diligence in the face of the court’s deadlines, and despite extended opportunity, was inexcusable, willful, prejudicial, and warranted dismissal of her case.</p>
    <p id="b45-4" data-blocks='[["BL_45.4",45,[147,738,749,544]]]'>¶ 16 Appellees Keohane, Pennsylvania Hospital and Thomas Jefferson Hospital also took the position that Appellant had expressly acquiesced to summary judgment in their favor by stating on the record that she did not intend to oppose their motions. These Appellees concluded, therefore, that Appellant was bound by her prior position and was now estopped from challenging the orders entering summary judgment in their favor.</p>

Although Appellant should have requested more time or, in the alternative, filed another petition for relief from the deadline as a precautionary measure, Appellant’s answer to the motions for summary judgment of Appellees Aiken and Meltzer provided extenuating circumstances and put the court and counsel on notice that Appellant’s expert reports were imminent.

The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas Day Backward Programs, and the successor Day Forward Programs, are case management programs designed to reduce the Philadelphia trial court’s backlog of untried cases by setting definite pretrial deadlines and <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>trial dates. Prior to the institution of these programs, the First Judicial District had been plagued with poorly defined trial pools and unpredictable trial dates that allowed cases to languish in the court system and defeat closure at the will of either party. The programs helped to create a level playing field for the parties while promoting efficient court proceedings. The discovery cut-off dates are intended to move the cases along and protect against trial by ambush. As a whole, these programs have been viewed as a boon to plaintiffs. The team leader or trial judge retains certain discretion in enforcing these deadlines. <em>See, e.g., Zito v.
