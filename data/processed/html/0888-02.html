Those cases essentially hold that a police officer on twenty-four hour call never departs from the course of employment, although a particular injury may still be noncompensable because it does not arise out of the employment. We expressly declined to reach that issue in <em>Abshire, </em>however. We now refuse to extend the scope of the section 51(1) requirement that injuries occur in the course of employment to encompass an employee injured while driving home from work, even though he is technically on call twenty-four hours a day. When Westberry concluded his formal shift with the police department, he departed from the course of employment. The fact that he was on call twenty-four hours a day is not, without more, enough to bring him within the course of employment. We also find unpersuasive the argument that Westberry was injured on his employer’s premises because he was injured on a highway within the jurisdiction of the Cape Elizabeth Police Department.</p>

There, a police officer in uniform whose shift ended at 6:00 p.m. was injured at 6:20 p.m. when he slipped on some ice after he alighted from a bus while en route to his residence for the evening. Importantly, the court stressed that a policeman in that jurisdiction, while wearing <em>in public </em>a uniform during a period of time permitted by the police department’s rules and regulations, furnished real benefits to the employer as well as to the public. Moreover, the officer was subject to extra departmental restrictions because the uniform signified to the public that the officer was on duty. <em>Jasaitis, </em><a href="/nj/31/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="31 N.J. 81" data-case-ids="565170" data-case-paths="/nj/31/0081-01">31 N.J. 81</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20260" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="155 A.2d 260">155 A.2d at 263</a>. Westberry was in his private vehicle, however, and was not subject to such extra restrictions. We are equally unpersuaded by other authorities cited by Westberry in support of compensability.
