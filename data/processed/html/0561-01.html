    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[159,532,750,419]]]'>The bizarre facts of this criminal episode are, briefly, that in September of 1974 Dorothy Yancey, the assault victim, was living at 1418 Fifth Street, N.W., with one Willie Sampson<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and his cousin, Junior Peterson. Their neighbor was Harry Charles Brown. Appellant and her husband, Nick, lived in a rooming house next door to Brown.</p>
    <p id="b615-6" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[159,994,749,1204]]]'>On September 7, 1974, Margaret Morant, the murder victim, visited the Yancey household, as did appellant Nicholson. In a spirit of conviviality the assembled party ate, drank beer and vodka, played cards, and danced to records. At one point during the evening Sampson and Yancey quarreled when Sampson snatched Yan-cey’s rent money from her. Morant became upset at this argument and retired to an upstairs bedroom. Yancey, wielding a “grass blade” (small scythe), chased Sampson out of the house. Appellant was in or near the front yard when Yancey returned to the house and the two proceeded to quarrel with one another about Sampson. The result of this disagreement was that appellant told Yancey that “somebody was going to take Willie away from [her]” and stabbed Yancey in the stomach with a weapon like an elongated penknife.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Although she was bleeding from the wound, Yancey chose not to go to the doctor. Instead, she remained at home for several hours watching television.</p>

Brown testified that appellant had suggested going over to Yancey’s in search of her husband. Sometime during this visit, Brown went upstairs to the bedroom to visit Morant. Shortly thereafter, appellant went home. Still later, Yancey went to a bootlegger to get more refreshments for Morant and Brown. On her way, she passed appellant who was then sitting on her own front porch. When, in about twenty minutes, Yancey returned to her house from her errand, she was told by Brown, “That damn fool [Irene] done stabbed Margaret.” Brown, who had been drinking heavily, was trying to telephone for assistance. Morant was lying on Yan-cey’s bed bleeding profusely from a chest wound and gasping for breath.</p>
    <p id="b615-9" data-blocks='[["BL_615.8",615,[965,967,751,913]]]'>According to Brown, before the stabbing appellant and Morant were having a heated argument, the substance of which is not of record. Morant was in the upstairs bedroom with Brown; appellant was outside on the lawn. Three to four minutes after the argument had apparently subsided, the bedroom door burst open and appellant entered the room. She said something like, “Bitch, what did you say about my mother?” Brown testified that he turned around and saw appellant holding two knives. He saw her stab Morant in the chest with one of them and heard her say, “Take that.” Morant said nothing. She was “laying [sic] on the edge of the bed” flat on her back at the time. There were no other weapons of any kind in the bedroom or in the possession of Morant.</p>
    <p id="b615-10" data-blocks='[["BL_615.9",615,[965,1918,753,419]]]'>Yancey was allowed to testify that when she found Morant upstairs, she picked her up in her arms and asked her, “What in the world happened?” In response Mor-ant repeated the name, “Irene, Irene, Irene.” She then made a “little funny groan” and slumped over, never to regain consciousness. Yancey thought she was dead.</p>

A knife was found in the bed in the room in which she was found, but the government could not produce evidence proving it was the murder weapon. At the time of her arrest, appellant said to the police officer not only that “[she] didn’t kill nobody” but also “if you can’t find the [expletive deleted] knife, you can’t prove nothing.” She admitted she was at Yancey’s house at 2:00 a.m. and again at 5:25 a.m., and stated that she had left to get liquor for Yancey.
