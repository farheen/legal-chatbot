The appellant, The Celotex Co., filed opposition thereto, basing such opposition upon its use and ownership of the trade-mark “ Celotex,” used on goods of the same descriptive properties. The examiner of interferences dismissed the <a id="p1485" href="#p1485" data-label="1485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1485</a>opposition and granted registration, and this decision was affirmed, on appeal, by the Commissioner of Patents of the United States-Patent Office.</p>

    <p id="b803-4" data-blocks='[["BL_803.5",803,[68,587,1320,296]]]'>The Commissioner of Patents held, and we think the testimony supports such holding, that the opposer began the manufacture of' this material in 1921 or 1922, and ever since that time has been selling the same in largely increasing quantities; that for many years prior to the entrance of the applicant into the field, the opposer has been using the trade-mark “ Celotex ” in interstate commerce-</p>
    <p id="b803-5" data-blocks='[["BL_803.6",803,[72,889,1318,445]]]'>The Celotex Co. procured the registration of its mark by certificate No. 187332, on July 29, 1924. It appears from the testimony, and is fully set out in <em>The Celotex Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago Panelstone Co.,, </em>Patent Appeal No. 2887, and <em>The Celotex Co. </em>v. <em>Bronston Bros. et al., </em>Patent Appeal No. 2886, decided concurrently herewith, that the opposer has spent very large sums of money in advertising its aforesaid trade-mark and has built up a very large and profitable-business in the goods bearing this trade-mark. The appellant is a newcomer in this field, so far as the record discloses.</p>
    <p id="b803-6" data-blocks='[["BL_803.7",803,[74,1342,1318,537]]]'>The Commissioner of Patents, in deciding this matter, called attention to a number of trade-marks in which the syllable “ tex was used, and the use of which was prior to the use by the opposer of its mark “ Celotex.” These various marks were marks which had been adoj)tecl, and in some cases registered in the Patent Office,, used in connection with the sale of oil cloth, bricks, wall paper, gasoline, etc. From this circumstance, the commissioner concluded that the syllable “ tex ” had been used probably to such an extent as to preclude the opposer from any monopoly thereof, such as the commissioner felt would arise from sustaining such an opposition as the one before us here.</p>

The only question for the tribunals of the Patent Office, and for this court, in this case, is the question as to whether the registration of the mark <a id="p1486" href="#p1486" data-label="1486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1486</a>“ Fir-Tex ” will be likely to cause confusion in the minds of the public, and induce purchasers of wall board to mistake the product of the appellant for that of the opposer. If there is likely to be such confusion, then the mark ought not to be registered.</p>

    <p id="b804-7" data-blocks='[["BL_804.7",804,[260,1851,1314,384]]]'>The question of whether confusion would or would not exist is, after all, one which appeals to the judgment of the court which is called upon to decide that matter. This may account for the wide divergence of views which is found in the decisions of the courts in such matters. The ascertainment of whether confusion will or will not exist, is far from being an exact science, and every case must be determined upon its own facts, under the principles of law frequently announced by this court.</p>

Second, that the public might be protected against confusion. It is an unfortunate fact that when one has adopted some arbitrary trade-mark for his goods, and by patience and labor, or by superior salesmanship, or by the good quality of his goods, or by extensive and costly advertising, or by all of these, has established a profitable and valuable business, there are to be found many who flock to the feast, unbidden guests, and fatten themselves at the table which has been spread.</p>

We do not so hold. There may be, and doubtless are, many ways in which this syllable might be used in a trade-mark or trade name where it would not conflict and be confusing with the mark of the appellant. In such cases, no legal objection could be made to its being so used.</p>
