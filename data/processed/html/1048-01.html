Appellee’s application was filed February 21, 1925.</p>

This consolidation included the Oakland Preserving Co. The latter company was organized in 1891 by F. Tillman, sr., who was president of the corporation and owned a controlling interest in its stock. The business of the Oakland Preserving Co. was canning fruits, vegetables and preserves. Upon the consolidation of the Oakland Preserving Co. with the California Fruit Canners Association, F. Tillman, sr., became a director in the new company and a member of the finance committee. Mr. F. Tillman, sr., prior to and at the time of the organization of the Oakland Preserving Co., owned a controlling-interest in Tillman <em>&amp; </em>Bendel, wholesale grocers, and so continued until 1915, when he retired, his son later (1920) becoming president,, upon reorganization. Upon the organization of the Oakland Preserving Co., the suggestion of F. Tillman, sr., that the trade-mark “ Del Monte ” be used upon their fruits, vegetables, and preserves, was approved by other interested officials. At the time it was generally known that there was a popular hotel in San Francisco by the name of Del Monte and both sides hereto agree that the name “ Del Monte,” as a trade name, is derived from the name of the Del Monte-Hotel. . • ,</p>

Appel- ■ lant’s business of manufacturing and selling said products under its trade-mark, of which the name “ Del Monte ” is the most conspicuous part, has grown to an aggregate of over $30,000,000 per year and its outlay on advertising has amounted to over $11,000,000. The ■testimony indicates that all of its materials are of very high grade, and all of the products are sold in grocery stores. From the beginning its business has been a growing and expanding one, new canned, bottled, preserved, and dried products being added to its line from time to time. It has never handled tea or spices and has only dealt in coffee to the extent that it regarded necessary for it to comply with trade-mark requirements, in anticipation, evidently, of making-application for the registration of a trade-mark.</p>

Congress, therefore, by the use of the 'words “ merchandise of the same descriptive properties,” could not be presumed to have authorized the registration of a trade-mark ■for public use which use could be prevented by resort to the common law. (See Hopkins on Trademarks, Tradenames and Unfair Competition, Fourth Edition, page 49.) While, in courts of equity, there may be principles of law applied in actions concerning unfair trade practices and unfair competition, growing out of trade-marks, which are not applicable in proceedings like that at bar, the law, nevertheless, must be the same in both jurisdictions regarding the question of the probability of confusion. It is inconceivable that •Congress in its efforts to lessen confusion, deceit, and mistake in connection with the use of trade-marks, which must be regarded by the courts as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership, intended to ■authorize the registration of a trade-mark which was invalid at ■common law and thus arm the registrant with a weapon, impotent for good but virile for mischief. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Uri, </em><a href="/app-dc/31/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="31 App. D.C. 441" data-case-ids="1356064,1356125" data-case-paths="/app-dc/31/0441-01,/app-dc/31/0441-02">31 App. D.

We are only concerned in this action with appellee’s right of <em>registration. </em>of the trade-mark and 'not with its <em>use </em>of the same. As to whether appellee, in law, has the right to use the trade name “ Del Monte ” on coffee in containers of any description, or whether it has the right, to use it in markets confined to the West coast or throughout the-world, are questions not before us and are not decided.

That case involved the use of a part of a corporate name, and the case arose under the second proviso of section 5, which proviso does not contain the words “ same descriptive properties.” ■Obviously, in deciding that case, the construction of the words “ same descriptive properties,” contained in the section, was not involved, ■and it was clearly proper to apply the test of confusion irrespective •of whether the goods of the parties were of the same descriptive ■properties.</p>

He applied the test of confusion only as to trade-marks on goods possessing the same descriptive properties; that is, he first determined class or descriptive properties, and then inquired into confusion, as we contend section 5 clearly requires.</p>
