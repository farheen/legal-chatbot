GemStat. § 20-138.1(a)(2) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> North Carolina’s drunk driving statute. On February 11, 1999, Ester pled guilty to the offense. North Carolina and Pennsylvania are both members of the Drivers’ License Compact of 1961 so North Carolina reported the conviction to Pennsylvania, as required by Article III of the Compact.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pursuant to Article IV of the Compact, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1581, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation treated the out-of-state conviction as if Ester had been convicted under 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731, Pennsylvania’s statute prohibiting driving under the influence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>Ester appealed the suspension to the Common Pleas Court of Erie County. President Judge Michael Palmisano of Erie County heard the appeal <em>de novo, </em>and reversed the suspension. Judge Palmisa-no found that Ester was convicted under a North Carolina statute that required a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher, while Pennsylvania’s comparable statute, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731, requires a blood alcohol level of at least 0.10%.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> He concluded that “the twenty percent (20%) difference in blood alcohol concentration necessary for a conviction under the North Carolina statute is substantially different so as to nullify the suspension.” <em>Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, v. Ester, </em>slip op. at 2 (citation omitted).</p>

The statute states, in relevant part: 75 Pa.C.S. § 1586.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The statute is exactly on point. Ester argues, however, that “The term ‘different degree of impairment’ relates to the descriptive violation of various drunk driving statutes, not the per se violation of drunk driving statutes for a specific blood alcohol level.” Appellee’s brief, at 8. This argument is not convincing. First, different blood alcohol levels are clearly different degrees of impairment. Second, the Court’s duty is not to compare North Carolina’s statute to Pennsylvania, but, as noted above, to compare North Carolina’s statute to Article IV(a)(2) of the compact, which does not use a specific blood alcohol level in its description.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, the correct comparison is never between blood alcohol levels, but between Article IV’s description and the state law.</p>

    <p id="b120-9" data-blocks='[["BL_120.10",120,[996,1190,750,429]]]'>Our court has previously held in <em>Golinsky v.
