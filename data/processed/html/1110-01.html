    <p id="A25Z" data-blocks='[["BL_561.12",561,[466,799,676,42]]]'>delivered the opinion of the court:</p>
    <p id="b561-10" data-blocks='[["BL_561.13",561,[87,849,1322,296]]]'>In this case appellant (opposer) has appealed from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents sustaining the action of the examiner of interferences dismissing the opposition to the application of ap-pellee for registration as a trade-mark of the compound word “ Zip-Midy,” having superimposed thereon in a panel shaped box or elongated rectangle the word “ Kenilworth.”</p>
    <p id="b561-11" data-blocks='[["BL_561.14",561,[88,1152,1320,245]]]'>Opposer is the owner of the trade-mark registered April I, 1925, No. 191090, comprising the word “ Zipper ” used on boots and overshoes of rubber and fabric. Appellee (applicant) states use on and for “ wearing apparel for men, women, and children — namely middies and sport shirts made of knitted and textile fabrics.”</p>
    <p id="b561-12" data-blocks='[["BL_561.15",561,[88,1406,1319,142]]]'>We think the case is on all fours with one between the same parties, No. 2209, heard and decided concurrently herewith wherein the words at issue are “ Zipper ” and “ Zip-Knick.”</p>
    <p id="b561-13" data-blocks='[["BL_561.16",561,[87,1557,1321,285]]]'>The only resemblance in the marks themselves is contained in the single syllable “ Zip.” In the instant case the imposition of the word “ Kenilworth ” over or upon the larger letters “ Zip-Midy ” tends to make the resemblance even more remote than that existing between the marks “ Zipper ” and “ Zip-Knick ” in plain letters'in case 2209.</p>
    <p id="b561-14" data-blocks='[["BL_561.17",561,[88,1861,1320,193]]]'>We think the marks are entirely dissimilar and that the use by appellee of “ Zip-Midy,” as proposed, would not be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers and should be admitted to registration. '</p>
    <p id="b561-15" data-blocks='[["BL_561.18",561,[130,2062,861,41]]]'>The decision of the commissioner is <em>affirmed.</em>
