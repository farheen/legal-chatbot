A sentencing hearing was held on November 9, 1993. The district court fined Pangallo $50,000 and sentenced him to seven years in prison, to run concurrently with sentences imposed in two other cases (CR93-1523 and CR93-1370). The issue of credit for time served was not raised at the sentencing hearing, and Pangallo received no such credit.</p>

Therefore, Pangallo should properly have filed a petition for post-conviction habeas relief, not a post-conviction motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, the procedural label <em>per se </em>is not crucial.</p>

However, although we will not dismiss the appeal of such a request simply because it is not labeled a petition for habeas relief, we must dismiss such an appeal where the movant or petitioner has not met the relevant substantive statutory requirements for such a request.</p>
    <p id="b718-8" data-blocks='[["BL_718.7",718,[225,934,1121,670]]]'>NRS 34.370(3) requires a habeas petitioner to “state facts which show that the restraint or detention is illegal.” NRS 34.735 sets forth the form which a habeas petition must substantially follow and requires a petitioner to inform the court of a number of things, including the crime, case number, and sentence being served for any conviction other than the one under attack and a concise statement, with supporting facts, of every ground in the petition. This court has stated that a defendant seeking post-conviction relief must raise more than conclusory claims for relief; a defendant must support any claims with specific factual allegations that if true would entitle him or her to relief. Hargrove v. State, <a href="/nev/100/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="100 Nev. 498" data-case-ids="2406390" data-case-paths="/nev/100/0498-01">100 Nev. 498</a>, 502, <a href="/nev/100/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="100 Nev. 498" data-case-ids="2406390" data-case-paths="/nev/100/0498-01">686 P.2d 222</a>, 225 (1984).

    <p id="b718-10" data-blocks='[["BL_718.9",718,[221,1681,1125,668]]]'>Pangallo has alleged no facts other than that he spent time in jail from July 16 to August 2, 1993 and received no credit for that time in his sentence in this case. Even if these allegations are true, they do not establish that Pangallo is entitled to relief given that he was sentenced in other cases in which he may have received credit for the jail time at issue. This court considers the sufficiency of a habeas claim not in the abstract but in the context of the record. Although we should not hypothesize facts that are not in the record which would render a claim insufficient, we also should not ignore facts that are in the record which do. The record does not repel Pangallo’s claim, but it includes pertinent facts which Pangallo’s allegations do not address. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, his claim lacks sufficient specific factual allegations that, if true, show he is entitled to relief.</p>

State, <a href="/nev/91/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="91 Nev. 155" data-case-ids="8556425" data-case-paths="/nev/91/0155-01">91 Nev. 155</a>, 158, <a href="/nev/91/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="91 Nev. 155" data-case-ids="8556425" data-case-paths="/nev/91/0155-01">532 P.2d 1034</a>, 1036 (1975) (appellant has responsibility to provide materials necessary for appellate review). This is not to say that a habeas petition for jail time credits must include documentary exhibits that support the petitioner’s factual allegations. If a petitioner alleges specific facts unbelied by the record and sufficient to state a claim for jail time credits, the State as the custodian of the relevant records has the burden to provide such records to rebut — or confirm — the petitioner’s allegations. We do not know what records, if any, were presented to the district court in this case. If Pangallo had alleged a sufficient claim for relief, we would reverse the district court’s order because there is nothing in the record before us to rebut such a claim. However, Pangallo never alleged a sufficient claim.</p>
    <p id="b719-6" data-blocks='[["BL_719.5",719,[182,997,1122,721]]]'>To meet the requirements for a habeas petition relevant to this case, Pangallo’s motion, at a bare minimum, should have specified the crimes, case numbers, and sentences being served for convictions other than the one for which he seeks jail time credit and would have alleged that he did not receive any credit in his other sentences for any of the jail time at issue. If Pangallo’s motion for jail time credits had provided this statutorily required information, the State would have had to provide the evidence to rebut or confirm Pangallo’s claim. This court would then have before it a record sufficient to determine whether or not Pangallo deserves credit for eighteen days spent in jail or deserves further proceedings on the issue. As it stands, such a determination is not possible, and we therefore affirm the district court’s order and dismiss this appeal without prejudice to Pangallo’s right to file a habeas petition on this matter,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> properly supported by specific factual allegations.</p>

In addition, even assuming the defendant was entitled to credit for time served from July 16, 1993, through October 2, 1993, as claimed by his motion, that time period amounts to 79 days, not the 89 days claimed by the defendant in his motion.</blockquote>
