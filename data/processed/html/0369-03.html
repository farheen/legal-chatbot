He began work as a private investigator with Interstate Investigations after graduation. Stevens received partial disability benefits because his wages with Interstate did not exceed his average weekly wage with Consolidation Coal. After working there for three years, Stevens accepted a higher paying job with a different investigation firm, Becker &amp; Company. When Stevens’ earnings from the second company exceeded his pre-injury weekly wage, his workers’ compensation benefits were suspended by a supplemental agreement dated July 14,1994.</p>
    <p id="b429-15" data-blocks='[["BL_429.14",429,[972,337,754,790]]]'>In October of 1994, Stevens was terminated from his employment with Becker &amp; Company. Stevens filed a petition to reinstate workers’ compensation benefits as of October 6, 1994. The petition stated that Stevens had suffered a total loss of earning power due to no fault of his own and requested that attorney fees be awarded on the basis of unreasonable contest by Consolidation Coal. Consolidation Coal responded to the reinstatement petition by asserting that Stevens’ loss of earning power was attributable not to his previous injury but to his inability to perform investigative work up to the standards imposed by Becker &amp; Company.</p>

The WCJ determined that during the period of time between Stevens’ termination from Becker &amp; Company and his rehiring by Interstate Investigations, Stevens was not working through no fault of his own, while continuing to suffer residuals of his earlier work injury that restricted him to alternative employment. The WCJ accepted as credible the testimony of Stevens and Joseph Becker, president of Becker &amp; Company, that Stevens had performed the job to the best of his ability, but simply was unable to meet the standards expected of him. The WCJ further concluded that Stevens had continued restrictions stemming from his work-related injury which prohibited his return to work with Consolidation Coal. Stevens was awarded total disability benefits for the period from October 6, 1994 through March 27, 1995. For the period Stevens <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>was re-employed by Interstate Investigations, the WCJ awarded partial disability benefits should the wage records demonstrate earnings lower than Stevens’ average weekly wage at the time of injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The WCJ denied attorney fees, finding that Consolidation Coal had a reasonable basis to contest the reinstatement petition.</p>

On March 11, 1998, the Board granted the petition, finding that it had erred in applying a “misconduct standard” in affirming the WCJ’s decision. In its opinion, the Board indicated that it was granting the petition for rehearing “for application of the correct standard of proof for a reinstatement, i.e. whether the current loss of earnings is related to the disability, as set forth in <em>Hertz-Penske [Truck Leasing Co. v.

The claimant sustained a lower back injury while employed by Ametek. He received temporary total disability benefits until he returned to work and executed a final receipt. The claimant later suffered a recurrence of his injury resulting in a reinstatement of benefits by supplemental agreement. Partial disability benefits were later paid to the claimant when he returned to work part-time and were terminated when he again returned full-time. The claimant worked full-time hours although he was unable to perform the required tasks of lifting heavy objects, prolonged bending, stretching, reaching and climbing ladders.

First, it is presumed because the causal connection between the original work-related injury and disability was initially either not contested by the employer or established by competent proof by the employee at the time of the original disability claim. Second, it is presumed because with a mere suspension of benefits, there is no contention by any party that the liability of the employer has terminated. The only fact established at a suspension of benefits is that the earning power of a claimant has improved to a point where benefits are no longer necessary.

Where the pre-injury position is not available, however, suspension of benefits is unwarranted because the employer has not demonstrated job availability.

The close of the employer’s business made claimant’s return to his pre-injury position impossible.

According to the majority, this formulation allocates the burden of proof concerning a claimant’s good faith in connection with the determination of job availability to the claimant in the first instance in the reinstatement context. Notably, however, such burden is allocated to the employer in connection with its burden of demonstrating job availability in all other contexts, including claim, modification and suspension proceedings. <em>See generally Vista Int’l Hotel v.

The reasoning underlying the decision to shift the burden to the claimant in the reinstatement context is not well developed in our decisional law and adds a layer of complexity to the workers’ compensation scheme that is, in my view, unnecessary. Instead, I would find it preferable to maintain the allocation of the initial burden of proof connected with job availability to the employer in the reinstatement context, as this would establish a clear, consistent rule for workers’ compensation jurisprudence. <em>See generally Vista, </em><a href="/pa/560/0012-02" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="560 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="95733,95826" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0012-02,/pa/560/0012-01">560 Pa. at </a>28 n. 11, <a href="/a2d/742/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="742 A.2d 649" data-case-ids="11500362,95733" data-case-paths="/a2d/742/0649-01,/pa/560/0012-02">742 A.2d at </a>658 n. 11 (stating that “where the claimant has established that a work-related injury is the cause of a loss in earnings capacity (or remains so) during the time period in is<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>sue, the employer will generally be charged with the initial burden of establishing job availability for that time period”).
