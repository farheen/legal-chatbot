Appellant argues that the complaint on its face fails to allege sufficient facts to bring this ease within the purview of the Attorney General’s authority as there was no specific allegation that either Appellant or the entities known as “North End Plumbing Company” or “North End Plumbing Incorporated” were corrupt organizations. Specifically, Appellant contends that the language in Count forty-nine, the only count that would implicate the Attorney General’s power to prosecute, fails to include any additional information apart from referencing the preceding forty-eight counts with the exception of the catchall language “through a pattern of racketeering activity as set forth in detail in Counts 1-48 above-” (R.R. at 8a). Thus, Appellant, relying on <em>Commonwealth v. Goodman, </em>and its progeny, sought to have the court of common pleas compel the Attorney General to demonstrate, prior to the preliminary hearing, the justification for the corrupt organizations charge.</p>
