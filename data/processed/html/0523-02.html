Code 1978 Supp., § 4-527(2). In this regard, petitioner at the Retirement Board hearing attempted to prove that work-related stresses played a significant part — either directly or indirectly — in the deterioration of his condition. He testified that in January 1973, he was indicted by a grand jury on charges brought by the police department. Following his indictment, he was placed on administrative leave without pay and was told to wait at home on an on-call basis. The criminal charges against him were dismissed in October 1974, but he was kept on leave until May 1975. During that period, petitioner did almost nothing except sit at home, watch television, smoke cigarettes and read books.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He got little or no exercise and as a result gained quite a bit of weight. Meanwhile, he separated from his wife and moved out of his home into a small apartment. Petitioner contends that these unfortunate situations and their attendant stresses were job-related and that they, coupled with the normal stresses associated with police work, were shown by the evidence to have aggravated petitioner’s condition to the point of disability. Thus, he argues, he should have been retired with the higher annuity provided under D.C. Code 1978 Supp., § 4-527(2).</p>

Neer had a physical examination on June 6, 1978, prior to presentation to the Retirement and Relief Board by the Police and Fire Clinic physician, Dr. Yeager. His primary diagnosis was coronary artery disease — stable angina, with additional diagnoses of exogenous obesity and history of hypertension. The primary diagnosis is hardening of the arteries which prevents them from carrying the normal amount of blood to the heart muscle causing chest pain upon exertion when the work of the heart is greater than the blood supply. There are a number of factors that cause a person to have hardening of the arteries, such as cigarette smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history of heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. Sgt. Neer smoked one and one-half packs of cigarettes daily. He was 68¾ inches tall and weighed 225 pounds on June 6, 1978. He has a strong family history of heart disease; namely, his father died of a heart condition at age 44, his uncle died at age 41 of a heart condition, his brother has heart disease and hypertension.

On appeal, petitioners argued that their pre-existing personality disorders had been aggravated to the point of disability by a number of “service related” factors, including long and arduous hours of duty during the 1968 riots and demonstrations; having to drop an assault charge <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>against a diplomat at the insistence of a commanding officer; being told in a “gruff’ manner by a superior officer to go out and correct some 40 parking citations the policeman had misdated earlier that day; and general persecution by superior officers. The court upheld the Board’s decision, ruling that “emotional resentments to such normal incidents” of police duty need not be considered as aggravations under § 4-527(2). <em>Id., </em>at 571.

The court ruled that as a matter of law “such aggravating factors cannot be considered ‘performance of duty’ as that term is used in [§ 4-527(2)].” <em><a href="/a2d/330/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="330 A.2d 253" data-case-ids="12024068" data-case-paths="/a2d/330/0253-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/330/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="330 A.2d 253" data-case-ids="12024068" data-case-paths="/a2d/330/0253-01">at 256</a>.

      <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.2",580,[231,1876,725,854]]]'>Recently, however, a division of this court departed from this line of precedent in <em>Liberty v.

There the petitioner was disabled by a coronary artery disease; the only medical witness, Dr. Yeager, testified that the disease likely was the result of a number of factors, including hypertension, obesity, heredity, excessive smoking and stress. The Retirement Board made findings of fact to the effect that “[t]he most significant factor in this case is subject officer’s family histories” and “[p]olice duties did not play any part in subject officer’s condition.” <em><a href="/a2d/410/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="410 A.2d 191" data-case-ids="7965640" data-case-paths="/a2d/410/0191-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/410/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="410 A.2d 191" data-case-ids="7965640" data-case-paths="/a2d/410/0191-01">at 193</a>.

In so doing, however, the court suggested that normal job-related stress may be an appropriate aggravation criterion under the retirement statute <em>(id., </em>at 194) —a suggestion which had not appeared in any prior decision of this court.</p>
      <p id="b580-7" data-blocks='[["BL_580.3",580,[1034,829,722,1178]]]'>Of course, the <em>Liberty </em>opinion cannot be read to have overruled prior precedent. <em>See M.A.P. v.

Nevertheless, its dicta inevitably raises a question as to what types of occupational stress should be considered service-connected under § 4-527. We can envision isolated instances in which the stress engendered by a specific on-the-job incident might be pinpointed as having precipitated a claimant’s disability — as, for example, where a policeman with a family history of heart trouble suffers a heart attack immediately following a high-speed chase and gun battle. The type of “job stress” in that example likely would be relatively easy for medical experts to identify and trace as the precipitating (or aggravating) cause of the disability. On the other hand, vague allegations of general job stress arising from the inherent nature of police of firefighting work are not susceptible to proof as a service-related causative factor leading to a disability, and there is no indication that such stress was within Congress’ contemplation as occurring in “the performance of duty” when it enacted § 4-527. It is difficult to imagine that a medical witness — or the Retirement Board— could meaningfully segregate the effect of routine everyday job stresses (common to an infinite variety of occupations) from the effect of non-duty-related stresses on the claimant’s disabling condition. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>infra.</em>

      <p id="b580-8" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[1032,2014,720,643]]]'>We think, then, that whenever a claimant seeks to prove that service-connected stress was a significant causative or aggravating factor in his disability, he must demonstrate specific, articulable sources of that stress. In this case, we eschew deciding whether the job stresses asserted by petitioner were sufficiently specific to be considered as an aggravating factor under the retirement statute; instead, as discussed in the text <em>infra, </em>we affirm on the alternative ground that the record supports the Retirement Board’s determination that petitioner failed to carry his burden of proving that duty-related factors outweighed the extrinsic causes of his disability.
