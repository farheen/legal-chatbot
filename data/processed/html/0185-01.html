    <p id="b231-19" data-blocks='[["BL_231.18",231,[1010,1317,751,516]]]'>The plaintiff, Utica Mutual Insurance Company, appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court (Cumberland County) denying its claim against St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company. Plaintiff contends that the Superior Court erred in finding no implied contract of insurance between St. Paul and plaintiff’s assignors, Leo and Georgette Fortier. We sustain the appeal and order entry of judgment for the plaintiff.</p>

Pence, issued a fire insurance policy with St. Paul to the Fortiers for a building containing their dry-cleaning business. Each year Pence automatically renewed the policy. Due to a clerical error in Pence’s office, the policy expired on March 18, 1980. The error remained undiscovered until a fire loss occurred on February 7, 1981. St. Paul refused to cover the loss. Utica Mutual, Pence’s errors and omissions carrier, paid the Fortiers for their loss and obtained an assignment of all their rights against St. Paul.</p>

After both parties moved for summary judgment, St. Paul’s motion was granted. On appeal, this Court found that there existed a genuine issue as to a material fact, namely, the existence of an implied contract between the Fortiers and St. Paul. The case was remanded to the Superior Court. <em>Utica Mutual Insurance Company v.

These requisites for an implied contract are present in the case at bar. The Superior Court specifically found that Pence had authority to bind St. Paul and also found that St. Paul would have renewed the policy if requested by Pence. Notwithstanding these findings, however, the Court concluded that an implied contract was precluded by the fact that “[t]he Fortiers dealt entirely with Mr. Pence and relied on him, not the carrier he selected to provide their insurance.” The Superior Court attaches unwarranted legal significance to the fact that the Fortiers dealt exclusively with Pence. In doing so, the Court ignores the fact that Pence was the agent of St. Paul, and as principal, St. Paul is charged with responsibility for the acts of its agent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
