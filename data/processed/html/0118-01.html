    <p id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[135,411,753,694]]]'>Appellant, Robert J. Triffin (Triffin), appeals from the trial court’s order of disqualification entered on June 4, 1993. The provisions of this order may be summarized as follows: 1) Triffin was disqualified from participating in this action as a plaintiff and/or as a “pro persona plaintiff;” 2) Triffin was enjoined from suing defendants, his former clients; 3) Triffin was enjoined from revealing to third parties any information obtained from defendants through the former confidential relationships; 4) The action was dismissed with prejudice since the court found an impermissible conflict of interest. For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b185-6" data-blocks='[["BL_185.6",185,[133,1128,754,655]]]'>During the summer of 1992, Triffin approached Appellee, Anthony Mark, Ltd. t/a A &amp; M Check Cashing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and spoke with its personnel about doing collection work for A &amp; M. Upon arriving at A &amp; M’s office, Triffin explained to A &amp; M that he was a “lawyer” specializing in the collection of bad debts; Triffin, however, is not licensed to practice law in any state, although he is a law school graduate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> With the permission of A &amp; M, Triffin reviewed confidential information in A' &amp; M’s files which included bank statements. Triffin promised A &amp; M that this information would be kept in confidence.</p>
    <p id="b185-7" data-blocks='[["BL_185.7",185,[133,1805,752,267]],["BL_185.8",185,[936,225,753,512]]]'>In March 1993, Triffin approached Appel-lee Burke and told her that he had run across some checks which were cashed by A &amp; M on forged endorsements. Triffin explained that United Jersey Bank was likely to make a claim on these checks and offered to assist A &amp; M and try to settle the matter on its behalf. Shortly after this conversation, Burke provided Triffin with further information with respect to the checks in question. Triffin related a settlement figure to Burke and explained that the check should be made payable to him. It was at this moment that Burke realized that Triffin was representing himself rather than A &amp; M and, as a result, the attorney-client relationship terminated.</p>
    <p id="b185-11" data-blocks='[["BL_185.11",185,[934,785,755,465]]]'>On April 19,1993, Triffin sued A &amp; M on a chose in action which he had purchased from United Jersey Bank and which involved the same checks Triffin had discussed with A &amp; M in March 1993. Although it is unclear from the record, it appears that Triffin purchased the chose from United Jersey Bank with the intention of using it to obtain a settlement check made payable to him from A &amp; M.</p>
    <p id="b185-12" data-blocks='[["BL_185.12",185,[933,1318,756,520]]]'>A &amp; M filed a motion requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that Triffin be disqualified from participating in this action pro se and otherwise disqualified from suing his former clients, A &amp; M. On May 17, 1993, the trial court conducted a hearing on A &amp; M’s motion, and on June 4, 1993, entered an order disqualifying Triffin from appearing in any capacity in this action, and dismissing his action with prejudice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is from this order that Triffin appeals.</p>
