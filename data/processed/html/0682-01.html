The child was impatient to leave, but the parents needed a few more minutes to finish preparations. Mr. Coe directed Andrew to wait for them at the top of the stairs leading from their apartment down to the landing and exit from the apartment house on the first floor. Although Andrew was not at the top of the steps when his parents checked on him, they assumed he was waiting for them on the landing downstairs. Because Andrew was not on the landing when Mr. Coe looked, he descended the stairs to see if his son was waiting outside. As he emerged from the apartment, Coe observed Andrew entering a field across the street, where a pony was tethered to a clump of bushes. Instead of stopping when his father called, Andrew proceeded directly to the pony. Although Coe ran after his son, before he could reach him, the pony kicked Andrew on the head, resulting in partial paralysis of Andrew’s left side.</p>

Powell, the owner of the land where the pony was tethered, and David Schneider, the lessee of the land. Schneider filed a third-party action against Coe, seeking contribution on the ground of negligent parental supervision. The Superior Court granted Coe’s motion for summary judgment as third-party defendant, concluding that <em>Strahorn v.

The argument goes that our conclusion in <em>Williams, </em>that “when liability insurance exists, the domestic tranquility argument is, at best, hollow”, <a href="/a2d/369/0669-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="369 A.2d 669" data-case-ids="8002575" data-case-paths="/a2d/369/0669-01">369 A.2d at 672</a>, undermines <em>Strahorn </em>because the Court’s rationale in <em>Strahorn </em>was that parental immunity was necessary to pre<a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>serve domestic tranquility. But Schneider has failed to persuade us to extend the automobile-negligence-by-parent rule of <em>Williams </em>to a supervision-negligence-by-parent action such as is here involved.</p>
    <p id="b748-4" data-blocks='[["BL_748.4",748,[205,531,751,1230]]]'>Unlike driving an automobile, supervision of one’s children involves issues of parental control, authority, and discretion that are uniquely matters of a very personal type of judgment. The freedom to exercise such judgment has constitutional underpinning <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and contrasts sharply with the State’s supervision and regulation of the judgment one must exercise while driving an automobile. Reciprocal rights and duties inhere in the parent-child relationship. Anything creating conflict between parent and child, or interfering with the authority, discretion, or control that a parent has the right to exercise in supervising his child is repugnant to the institution of the family, and therefore is against public policy. Parental immunity will not be abrogated where the duty arises from the family relationship, for to do so would manifestly tend to disturb domestic tranquility. It is for these reasons that we decline to extend <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/369/0669-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="369 A.2d 669" data-case-ids="8002575" data-case-paths="/a2d/369/0669-01">369 A.2d 669</a> (1976), to abrogate parental immunity in actions against parents for negligent supervision of their children.</p>

In a 1969 case involving negligent automobile driving, the New York Court of Appeals abolished “the defense of intrafamily tort immunity for nonwillful torts.” <em>Gelbman v. Gelbman, </em>N.Y.App., <a href="/ny-2d/23/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="23 N.Y.2d 434" data-case-ids="2287424" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/23/0434-01">23 N.Y.2d 434</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20N.Y.S.2d%20529" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="297 N.Y.S.2d 529">297 N.Y.S.2d 529</a>, 532, <a href="/citations/?q=245%20N.E.2d%20192" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="245 N.E.2d 192">245 N.E.2d 192</a>, 194 (1969). However, in 1974 in <em>Holodook, </em>the New York Court of Appeals was asked whether <em>Gelbman </em>allowed parents to be sued for negligent supervision of their children. The Court “concluded that a child does not have a legally cognizable claim for damages against his parent for negligent supervision.” <a href="/citations/?q=364%20N.Y.S.2d%20859" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="364 N.Y.S.2d 859">364 N.Y.S.2d at 863</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=324%20N.E.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="324 N.E.2d 338">324 N.E.2d at 340</a>. The Court distinguished the abrogation of parental immunity in the automobile cases because negligent driving is an actionable tort between “parties <em>absent </em>the family relationship”, whereas a “parent’s negligent failure to supervise his child is not presently recognized in New York as a tort, actionable by the child.” <a href="/citations/?q=364%20N.Y.S.2d%20859" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="364 N.Y.S.2d 859">364 N.Y.S.2d at 866</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=324%20N.E.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="324 N.E.2d 338">324 N.E.2d at 342</a>. The Court’s holding flowed from its conclusion that “where the duty is ordinarily owed, apart from the family relation, the law will not withhold its sanctions merely because the parties are parent and child.” <a href="/citations/?q=364%20N.Y.S.2d%20859" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="364 N.Y.S.2d 859">364 N.Y.S.2d at 871</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=324%20N.E.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="324 N.E.2d 338">324 N.E.2d at 346</a>.
