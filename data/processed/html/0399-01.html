Defendant believed that his mother-in-law was constantly interfering in his life, particularly in his relationship with his wife and children, and he openly expressed his animosity toward her, stating on numerous occasions to different people that “he wished her dead ... and that he would like to have her shot.”</p>
    <p id="b444-16" data-blocks='[["BL_444.16",444,[997,286,747,900]]]'>Ten days before the homicide, defendant and his wife approached William Fitzher-bert, with whom defendant was then living, and offered him $300 to shoot Norma Bennett. Mr. Fitzherbert disregarded the request, taking it to be “drunk talk.” On Saturday, October 6th, the day before Norma Bennett was killed, defendant purchased ammunition for a 45 caliber handgun. On that same day defendant also suggested to Fitzherbert that Fitzherbert should give a party and invite him. Defendant’s wife asked if she was to be included. Opening the glove compartment of the car in which they were riding with Fitzherbert, so that the ammunition he had purchased was revealed, defendant stated: “You didn’t want to know when it was going down.”</p>
    <p id="b444-17" data-blocks='[["BL_444.17",444,[997,1214,746,471]]]'>Defendant spent most of that Saturday and also the next day going from bar to bar drinking. On Sunday night, the night Norma Bennett was killed, defendant’s last stop was the Caribou Hotel, where he spoke to Joseph McNeal about his feelings toward Norma Bennett. According to McNeal, defendant had been drinking but he was able to speak coherently and to move without staggering.</p>
    <p id="b444-18" data-blocks='[["BL_444.18",444,[995,1713,748,264]]]'>Defendant left the Caribou Hotel and drove to Norma Bennett’s trailer intending to ask her to stop interfering with his family.

    <p id="b444-19" data-blocks='[["BL_444.19",444,[996,2013,747,609]]]'>Defendant’s version of subsequent events was that Norma Bennett came to the door of the trailer and, seeing the gun in his hand, grabbed for it and pushed him off the small porch outside the front door. Defendant claimed that he had no recollection of either pulling the trigger or hearing the gun discharge. He did remember seeing Norma Bennett standing in the doorway as he returned to his car.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Norma Bennett’s mother, Dora Ayotte, who lived with her and was at home the night Norma was killed, saw the defendant enter the trailer.</p>

The gun from which the recovered bullet was fired was found by the police under a hunting trailer, on property owned by defendant’s father located approximately one mile from the Bennett trailer. The gun had been fired once. On the evening Norma Bennett was killed a neighbor of defendant’s father saw the car that defendant usually drove being operated in the particular area where the gun was recovered, but he could not identify the operator.</p>

Defendant acknowledges that he heard the testimony of Dora Ayotte at the preliminary hearing.

    <p id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.7",446,[195,1792,748,179]]]'>Here, however, defendant was not so deprived. In the ruling denying defendant access, before trial, to the transcript of the grand jury proceedings, the justice stated:</p>

Defendant himself characterized his mental state at the time of his confrontation with Norma Bennett as “frustrated”, “upset”, and “confused.” The only other evidence regarding defendant’s state of mind just prior to the killing was provided by the testimony of Joseph McNeal. Defendant had been drinking with Mr. McNeal on the night of the murder shortly before he went to visit Norma Bennett. McNeal testified that defendant was “worked up” over the problems <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>with Norma Bennett. Neither McNeal’s testimony nor that of the defendant himself contains any evidence of the “extreme anger” required by the statute.

In asserting this claim, defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the ballistics evidence to identify the gun found on his father’s property as the source of the spent bullet found in the bathtub in the victim’s trailer. Defendant’s point, rather, appears to be that the evidence is insufficient to foreclose as reasonable a doubt that Norma Bennett was <em>in fact </em>shot and killed by <em>another </em>bullet, an <em>unre-covered second </em>bullet fired from some <em>other </em>gun.</p>
    <p id="b447-13" data-blocks='[["BL_447.14",447,[967,501,753,1369]]]'>Defendant’s argument is unpersuasive, more particularly in light of the direct eyewitness testimony of Dora Ayotte as to the shooting. In any event, even on the hypothesis that Dora Ayotte’s version of the shooting, as having occurred inside the trailer, should be taken to be overridden by the physical evidence tending to show that the shooting occurred outside the trailer, there was ample circumstantial evidence proving that defendant shot Norma Bennett. Defendant admitted that he had a 45 caliber gun with him when he went to the trailer, and a single bullet from this gun was found spent in the bathtub of the victim’s trailer. Norma Bennett’s wounds, as well as the bullet holes in the trailer door, the outside wall and the interior wall form an approximately straight line parallel to the floor about 35^40 inches above the plane of the floor, thus showing that a single bullet caused the victim’s wounds and the holes in the trailer. In sum, we cannot say that the jury would be acting irrationally were it to refuse to entertain as <em>reasonable </em>a doubt that an unrecovered second bullet fired by some unrecovered and unknown gun was the bullet that entered Norma Bennett’s body and caused her death.</p>
