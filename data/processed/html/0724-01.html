Post-trial motions were denied, and McMaster was sentenced to serve concurrent terms of imprisonment of not less than five (5) years nor more than ten (10) years for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and not less than one (1) year nor more than five (5) years for incest. On direct appeal from the judgment of sentence, McMaster contends that the trial court erred: (1) by finding that the juvenile victim was competent to testify against him at trial; and (2) by allowing the Commonwealth to present evidence that the victim had been infected with gonorrhea, while, at the same time, excluding defense evidence that the defendant had been tested and found to have been free of gonorrhea. In addition, MeMas-ter has alleged several instances of ineffective assistance by his trial counsel. We will consider these claims seriatim.</p>

On Christmas morning, according to A.L., appellant’s daughter, who was four years old at the time, appellant took her into her bedroom and “put his penis in [her] mouth and he peed in [her] mouth and some stuff came out of his penis and he told [her] to swallow it, and [she] did.” Thereafter, the victim testified, appel<a id="p727" href="#p727" data-label="727" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*727</a>lant turned around and “pooped” into her mouth and forced her to chew it. The victim further stated that appellant had also “licked and kissed” her private parts. Subsequently, the victim described two other incidents during appellant’s visit in which he “pooped and peed” into her mouth. During one of these incidents, the victim said, appellant took pictures of her while she was naked.

In addition, the Commonwealth offered testimony from an expert on child sexual abuse to the effect that the victim’s infection with gonorrhea indicated that she had been sexually abused. The defense sought to exclude the evidence of the victim’s infection with gonorrhea, via a pre-trial motion in limine, on grounds that such evidence was irrelevant and highly prejudicial. The defense argued that this evidence should be excluded because the Commonwealth had no evidence that appellant had ever had gonorrhea, and it could not establish when the victim had become infected. As such, the defense asserted, the Commonwealth had no evidence to link appellant to the victim’s having been infected with gonorrhea. The Commonwealth, however, argued that the victim’s infection was relevant to prove that she had been sexually abused.

Nevertheless, despite its potentially inflammatory nature, we are satisfied that the probative value of the evidence of the victim’s gonorrhea infection outweighed its prejudicial impact. The defense in the instant case vigorously attacked the credibility of the victim’s testimony and suggested that her claims of sexual abuse were incredible. The only evidence available to the Commonwealth which tended to corroborate the fact that the victim had been sexually abused was the evidence of her having been infected with gonorrhea. Moreover, to alleviate any possible prejudice to appellant, the trial court instructed the jury that the victim’s infection with gonorrhea was only one piece of evidence in the ease, and, standing alone, could not be the basis for a finding of guilt.
