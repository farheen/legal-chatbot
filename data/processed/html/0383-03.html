It was titled “An Act Providing for the Duties of the Pennsylvania State Police Regarding Criminal History Background Reports for Persons Participating in Harness or Horse Racing.” At this point in time, the bill dealt exclusively with the Pennsylvania State Police providing support to the State Harness and Horse Racing Commissions by performing criminal history checks and the verification of fingerprints of applicants for licensure under the Race Horse Industry Reform Act of 1981.

The bill as amended included the creation of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (“Gaming Control Board” or “Board”), the issuance of gambling licenses authorizing the creation of a variety of slot machine casinos, the generation and distribution of revenues from the licenses, the creation of numerous funds including the Gaming Fund, the Pennsylvania Horse Race Fund, the Gambling and Economic Development and Tourism Fund, the Property Tax Relief Fund as well as a Compulsive and Problem Gambling Treatment Fund.

Specifically, Respondents question the standing of the non-legislative Petitioners, arguing that they do not have standing to challenge the Gaming Act. <em>See generally William Penn Parking Garage v.

Respondents acknowledge, however, that the legislative Petitioners do have standing to bring the current constitutional challenge. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to resolve Respondents’ standing challenge to the non-legislative Petitioners as the Petitioners that Respondents concede have standing, together with the contested Petitioners, collectively assert the various legal challenges to the Gaming Act. <em>See City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/575/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="838 A.2d 566" data-case-ids="630377,630455,9298628,9298712" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0541-01,/pa/575/0542-01,/a2d/838/0566-01,/a2d/838/0566-02">838 A.2d at </a>579 n. 8 (finding that as one party has standing, the Court need not consider whether another party also has standing).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Since the Complaint is based on challenges to the constitutionality of the statute, we must begin by considering the standard by which we resolve constitutional challenges to legislative actions. First, our case law makes clear that there is a strong presumption in the law that legislative enactments do not violate our Constitution. <em>See Pennsylvania School Boards Ass’n., Inc. et al. v. Commonwealth Ass’n. of School Administrators, </em><a href="/pa/569/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="569 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="312760" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0436-01">569 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/a2d/805/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="805 A.2d 476" data-case-ids="11433559,312760" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0476-01,/pa/569/0436-01">805 A.2d 476</a>, 479 (2002). This includes the manner by which legislation is enacted. <em><a href="/a2d/805/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="805 A.2d 476" data-case-ids="11433559,312760" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0476-01,/pa/569/0436-01">Id.</a> </em>Accordingly, a statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless it <em>clearly, palpably, </em>and <em>plainly </em>violates the Constitution. <em><a href="/a2d/805/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="805 A.2d 476" data-case-ids="11433559,312760" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0476-01,/pa/569/0436-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis supplied). All doubts are to be resolved in favor of finding that the legislative enactment passes constitutional muster. <em>Commonwealth v. Hendrickson, </em><a href="/pa/555/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="555 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1701983" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0277-01">555 Pa. 277</a>, <a href="/a2d/724/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="724 A.2d 315" data-case-ids="11635870,1701983" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0315-01,/pa/555/0277-01">724 A.2d 315</a>, 317 (1999). Thus, there is a very heavy burden of persuasion upon one who challenges the constitutionality of a statute. <em>Commonwealth v. Barud, </em><a href="/pa/545/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="545 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="465078" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0297-01">545 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/pa/545/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="681 A.2d 162" data-case-ids="465078,7859172" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0297-01,/a2d/681/0162-01">681 A.2d 162</a>, 165 (1996).

An enormous growth in the corporate form of business organization led to'significant concentrations of wealth and the corruption of numerous legislators. <em>Id. </em>at 62.

According to Respondents, courts have traditionally taken a broad view of the overall subject of a bill. Unlike the legislation at issue in <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>in which the vast subject of “municipalities” was rejected as overly broad for constitutional purposes, here, all provisions of the Gaming Act relate to the single subject of regulating gaming.</p>

The challenge was framed under the clear-title facet of Article III, Section 3, on the theory that the title of the enactment failed to afford adequate notice that the legislation would supplant prior legislation which dedicated the revenue stream from dog and livestock regulation to public education. This Court, however, rejected that challenge. Although acknowledging that the title of the statute failed to afford any notice of the repeal of previous acts which included the disposition of the funds realized under the provisions of the statute, the Court reasoned that such disposition was merely an incident of its enforcement, and therefore, required no express mention in the title. <em><a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%20204" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="106 A. 204">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%20204" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="106 A. 204">at 205</a> (“As the [relevant act] requires the payment of license fees, the disposition of such fees follows as a natural and necessary incident of its enforcement.

Many jurisdictions, however, enforce the legislative intent that severance should be accomplished even in such a context. <em>See, e.g., Hammerschmidt v.

Additionally, our prevailing precedent supports severance in such circumstances. <em>See Payne, </em><a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.%201072" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="31 A. 1072">31 A. at 1072</a>. Here, the provisions that we have found must be severed appear comparably modest in comparison to the overall character and effect of the legislation; indeed, the Legislature did not deem it necessary to include a specific referent to them in the title of the Gaming Act. Moreover, Petitioners have not asserted that our precedent should be overruled. Accordingly, we will enforce the clearly indicated legislative intent, <em>see </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1902, in conformance with precedent.</p>

He argues that SB 1209, PN 1997 became law on December 1, 2004, and that the bill significantly amended the language of Section 1506.

Respondents have asserted that Section 1506 reflects the Legislature's intent to preempt local zoning regulations. We agree that Section 1506 clearly reflects the legislative intent to override local zoning and land use provisions to the extent that a licensed facility has been approved by the Board. <em>See Olon v.
