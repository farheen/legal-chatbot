Leslie survived his mother but was murdered before PNC Bank completed the administration of her estate and before he received any distributions from the trust. After Leslie died, Florence’s two grandsons (Leslie’s nephews) took the position that Leslie’s failure to survive until such time as PNC Bank actually distributed the trust assets to him caused the defeasance of his interest in the trust. They argued that, instead, they became entitled to take as the alternative beneficiaries under the residuary clause of <a id="p1221" href="#p1221" data-label="1221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1221</a>the trust.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> PNC Bank rejected this construction, concluding, in reliance on general rules of construction favoring the early vesting of estates, that Leslie fully satisfied the survival contingency in the trust instrument by surviving his mother.</p>

Most directly, Miller contends that the petition is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and that the decision of the Supreme Court to enter summary judgment in favor of the two grandsons without a hearing deprived him of due process of law. Miller also asks this court to find <a id="p1222" href="#p1222" data-label="1222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1222</a>that the decision of the Supreme Court does not apply to funds distributed by PNC Bank to Leslie’s estate before the complaint in this matter was filed.

    <p id="b1270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1270.5",1270,[219,607,755,1209]]]'>In response, the grandsons contend that the court lacks the power to decide the two principal issues presented since the same issues were presented to-and presumably decided by-the Delaware Supreme Court. As to the other issues, the grandsons argue that the Supreme Court’s decision must be applied to all distributions made from the trust after Leslie’s death and that Miller cannot be entitled to fees from the trust since he has been found to have no interest in the trust. Thus, the grandsons ask this court to enter a form of order as follows: (i) vacating the Final Order and Judgment entered March 5, 2002, (ii) entering judgment in their favor and declaring them to be the residuary beneficiaries under the trust, (iii) directing PNC Bank to distribute the trust estate to them, per stirpes, (iv) retaining jurisdiction to resolve any remaining disputes between the parties relating to PNC Bank’s administration of the trust, and (v) assessing costs in the litigation against the defendants.</p>

Miller’s arguments were made in the Supreme Court, and this court must presume that the Supreme Court passed upon them both when it rendered its opinion (in the case of the statute of limitations argument) and when it denied the motion for reargument (in the ease of both the limitations argument and the due process argument).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, while these arguments have color-able merit, the court is bound to decline the invitation to reexamine them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The core holding of the Supreme Court’s decision is that the grandsons became the residuary beneficiaries of the trust at the time their uncle, Leslie, died. Thereafter, it is clear that PNC Bank had no right to regard anyone other than the grandsons as the rightful takers under Florence’s trust. In particular, according to the Supreme Court’s decision, PNC Bank had no right to distribute trust assets to Leslie’s estate, even though the grandsons had not yet asserted their claim. If a trustee mistakenly distributes trust assets to one other than a beneficiary entitled to them, the trustee is liable to the <a id="p1223" href="#p1223" data-label="1223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1223</a>beneficiary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Here, PNC Bank distributed trust assets to Leslie’s estate, where they remain.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Those funds can be and will be returned to the trust.</p>
    <p id="b1271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1271.5",1271,[85,550,756,1664]]]'>Miller’s request for reimbursement of his reasonable attorney’s fees raises more complex issues. As discussed in <em>Ableman v. Katz,</em>

      </a>
      <em> </em>attorney’s fees may be allowed even to a losing litigant in will contests where exceptional circumstances are present and the litigant’s actions have benefited the estate. There are certainly exceptional circumstances present here relating to Miller’s participation in this litigation. There is no question that Leslie became qualified to take under his mother’s trust at the time of her death. It is only because he was murdered before PNC Bank actually distributed the trust assets to him that the issue arose about the construction of the survival contingency in the trust. Thus, Miller was made a party to this litigation only because he is named as the sole beneficiary in Leslie’s will and was a necessary party. Miller’s only role in the litigation was to defend PNC Bank’s construction, as trustee, in favor of Leslie’s estate’s continuing right to take under the trust. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected the arguments in favor of that position, but those arguments were hardly insubstantial. On the contrary, prior authority in this state supported them and they were consistent with the generally applied rule of construction favoring the early vesting of estates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b1271-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1271.9",1271,[886,287,757,1697]]]'>It can also be said that Miller’s litigation efforts have benefited the trust. This statement may seem odd at first blush, but as a result of this litigation, the Supreme Court has concluded that Florence intended to impose an unusual survival contingency on her son Leslie (and, indeed, on the alternative residuary beneficiaries, as well). That is, that they not only be alive at the time of her death but that they remain living for however long it takes the trustee to distribute the trust assets to them. Understandably, Florence’s intention to impose such an open-ended and uncertain contingency was inconsistent with PNC Bank’s normal expectations regarding the orderly administration of trusts. After all, the actual distribution of the trust assets could take months, or even years. “It could be accomplished all at once, or in stages. When it was actually begun, or completed, would be open to interpretation and, perhaps, litigation. Anomalously, [PNC Bank], by its actions or inactions, would be able to influence who would receive the legacy.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Thus, it can be said that Miller’s participation in the litigation, and his efforts to advance Leslie’s estate’s reasonable expectations in regard to the trust, was a necessary part of the process by which Florence’s intention was ultimately discerned and given effect.</p>

She is the one, the Supreme Court found, <a id="p1224" href="#p1224" data-label="1224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1224</a>who used ambiguous language to convey a highly unusual intention. It was that language that gave rise to Miller’s participation in this action, as the beneficiary of Leslie’s estate. By advancing the interests of Leslie’s estate in this matter, Miller simply played his role in the process necessary to give effect to Florence’s intent. For these reasons, the court will allow Miller’s reasonable counsel fees.</p>
