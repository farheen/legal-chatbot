The Court’s order necessarily assumes that the allegation that Saranc-hak “changed his mind” about pursuing collateral relief after disposition of the Federal Defender’s appeal is a valid ground upon which to grant reargument. That assumption, I believe, is erroneous. Neither Saranchak’s alleged declaration nor his “present intention” to pursue post-conviction relief remotely call into question the propriety of this Court’s appeal dismissal order that is the exclusive subject of this reargument application. Furthermore, because the averments in the present application clearly do not otherwise warrant reargument, I would deny the Federal Defender’s application. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>

A jury was convened for the penalty phase, and fixed the penalty at death. On direct appeal, this Court unanimously upheld the convictions and affirmed the death sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

He further stated that he had sufficient time to ponder the magnitude of his crimes, and he was in agreement with the sentence of death. At a subsequent hearing, the PCRA court conducted a colloquy during which Saranchak reiterated his desire to waive both counsel and all further review. The PCRA court concluded that Saranc-hak’s waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent and, accordingly, removed the Federal Defender as counsel and dismissed the PCRA petition. The Federal Defender appealed this decision. On October 3, 2000, the Governor signed a warrant of execution, scheduling Saranchak’s execution for November 8, 2000.

On October 25, 2000, this Court remanded the case for supplementation of the record with expert psychiatric opinion as to Sar-anchak’s present ability to effectuate a valid waiver of his right to counsel and to pursue further collateral proceedings. The stay motion was held in abeyance <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>pending the outcome of this inquiry. A court-appointed psychiatrist examined Sar-anchak, filed a report, and testified at a supplemental waiver proceeding that, in his opinion, Saranchak was competent to waive his right to counsel and to pursue collateral proceedings.

Rambo, denied. Judge Rambo found that the purported “next friends” — Alexandra Fensterer, Esquire, an attorney with the Federal Defender who previously represented Saranc-hak in related proceedings, and Dennis Troup, Saranchak’s step-father, who did not appear at the federal hearing — were not individuals “who are truly dedicated to the best interest of Mr. Saranchak.” Accordingly, Judge Rambo held that the movants lacked standing to seek a stay of execution. Order, Rambo, J., November 8, 2000 (attached to Commonwealth’s Response as Exhibit A). A Third Circuit panel, however, granted a stay and listed the matter for expedited briefing, specifically directing the parties to brief the standing issue. The United States Supreme Court denied the Commonwealth’s application to vacate the stay, and Saranc-hak’s warrant of execution expired as a matter of course.</p>

The declaration also purports to authorize Assistant Defender Fensterer to act as Saranchak’s “next friend,” if necessary, in any future legal proceedings.

    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[166,598,758,1287]]]'>The <em>Lonchar </em>Court’s recognition that a waiver of <em>state </em>habeas reyiew does not necessarily waive the right <em>to federal </em>habe-as review also is neither exceptional, nor at all relevant to the question presented here. Saranchak was not barred from filing a first federal habeas petition because he elected to waive his rights under the PCRA. Indeed, the Third Circuit’s grant of a stay, upon motion of Saranchak’s alleged “next friends,” illustrates this. Here, no less than in <em>Lonchar, </em>it will be for the federal court to determine, as a matter of federal habeas corpus law, whether Sar-anchak’s explicit waiver of further review in the PCRA hearings encompassed a waiver of federal habeas review and, if not, whether his state court waiver, at a minimum, procedurally bars consideration of the merits of his PCRA claims on federal habeas corpus. But nothing in <em>Lonchar </em>remotely suggests that state courts lack the authority to rule upon issues of state waiver, including the question of the finality of those waivers for state collateral review purposes.</p>

Saranchak’s statutory right to PCRA review and his Criminal Rules-based right to PCRA counsel are no less waivable than more fundamental constitutional rights that are commonly waived in criminal cases, such as the right to a trial, the right to a jury, the right to testify, etc. I know of no case, and neither the Federal Defender nor the Court have cited any, that allows a waiver of rights to be automatically “withdrawn,” based upon a mere change of mind, after the highest appellate court in the Commonwealth has already ruled that it was knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and competently entered.</p>
    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.7",598,[968,399,753,930]]]'>If accepted, the position urged by the Federal Defender would seriously alter the salutary waiver doctrine and degrade the solemnity of the proceedings where waiver occurs. If a valid waiver is effective only until there is a change of mind then no waiver is ever final, no matter how clear and unequivocal the defendant’s record decision to forgo further proceedings. Any “waiver” can automatically be negated by a subsequent claim that the defendant merely has had a change of heart. A rational system of appellate jurisprudence cannot be based upon the whim and caprice of those who seek its benefits. Saranchak himself has closed the door to the collateral review process and has done so knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. The door should remain closed.</p>
    <p id="b598-8" data-blocks='[["BL_598.8",598,[969,1364,751,441]]]'>I recognize that the Court has not yet ruled upon the application for reargument itself and may very well ultimately deny reargument. Nevertheless, because, as a matter of law, the present arguments do not warrant reargument, I believe this remand order is erroneous, and it simply creates an additional, unnecessary delay. Hence, I respectfully dissent.</p>

The Federal Defender asserts that Saranc-hak’s declaration establishes that his previous waiver was "related to the ‘temble and inhumane’ conditions he has suffered on death row.” Although the declaration states a belief that the conditions on death row "have been terrible and inhumane,” Saranchak <em>never </em>alleges that this perception had <em>any </em>effect on his previous waiver.</p>

Among other things, AEDPA established a one-year filing deadline for federal habeas petitions. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 2244">28 U.S.C. § 2244</a>(d)(1).
