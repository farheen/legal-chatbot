Appellant claims that “the better reasoned case law, the Restatement (Second) of Agency and sound public policy all support the proposition that the District of Columbia should be held accountable for the subsequent conduct of its ambulance attendant.” After reviewing the material presented, we decline to accept appellant’s invitation because we are of the view that such an expansion of tort liability invokes significant public policy concerns that are better left to the legislature to resolve.</p>

This extension of vicarious liability could be based, argues appellant, on either of two grounds: (1) that the District’s ambulance service is a common carrier and common carriers are subject to a broader scope of liability than are others, or (2) a special relationship is created between the ambulance service and an ambulance passenger, who surrenders control over his or her safety, which imposes a special duty upon the ambulance service to protect the passenger from harm whatever the source. For the reasons set forth below we reject both grounds as bases for recovery.</p>

Nevertheless, both parties briefed and argued the issue of whether, on the merits, the statute of limitations would bar these claims. The District also asserts that if we were to reverse the order of the trial court dismissing Counts VI and VII it could, when the case is remanded, seek leave to amend its answer and then assert the statute of limitations defense. The determination of whether to grant or deny a motion to amend would be within the discretion of the trial court, and the District voices confidence in its ability to persuade the trial judge to provide such relief. The government further contends that if it is successful in amending the answer, it would then prevail on statute of limitations grounds. Therefore, the District argues that we should resolve this case by considering and adopting the statute of limitations argument it now advances. Because we hold there is no liability on any substantive ground, we do not decide that issue.</p>
