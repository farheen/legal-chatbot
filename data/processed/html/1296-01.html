    <p id="b615-11" data-blocks='[["BL_615.13",615,[82,831,1326,244]]]'>Appellant has here appealed from a decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office awarding priority of invention in the subject matter defined in counts 2, 3, and 4 of interference No. 71,740 to William E. Boyd, the senior party. The decision appealed from affirms the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>
    <p id="b615-12" data-blocks='[["BL_615.14",615,[83,1083,1325,84]]]'>Concerning the invention we quote the following from appellant’s brief:</p>
    <blockquote id="b615-13" data-blocks='[["BL_615.15",615,[83,1204,1326,745]]]'>Tlie invention defined by the counts of tlie interference relates to well drilling apparatus embodying core barrels wbicb are employed during the drilling of oil wells by the rotary drilling method to obtain samples of the earth so that the geological character thereof may be determined. A core barrel, as the term is employed in the rotary drilling art, is a tube provided at its lower end with cutting teeth to form a hollow coring drill which is mounted in the central passage or axial bore of the stem of the rotary drill or bit by which the drilling of the well is accomplished. When a core is to be taken, the drill stem is raised a short distance so that its lower end will be spaced slightly above the bottom of the well hole. The core barrel is then dropped or lowered through the drill stem until its lower end projects below the drill bit whereupon the core barrel, upon being rotated by the drill stem to which it is detachably latched, will cut a section or core from the geological formation being penetrated by the drill. The core thus cut is retained in the core barrel and may be inspected by raising the core barrel to the surface of the earth while the drill stem still remains in the well hole. The core barrel, as is the common practice, may be withdrawn upwardly through the drill stem by any suitable form of “fishing tool” or retrieving tool attached to the lower end of a cable * * *.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b615-14" data-blocks='[["BL_615.16",615,[83,1961,1325,277]]]'>To prevent the cutting head of the core barrel, which normally projects downwardly beyond the cutting bit of the drill stem, from becoming battered and deformed by hard earth formations to such an extent that withdrawal of the core barrel upwardly through the drill stem may be prevented or rendered difficult, it is desirable to provide yieldable means enabling the core barrel to recede upwardly within the drill stem upon encountering a hard formation. * * *</blockquote>
    <p id="b615-15" data-blocks='[["BL_615.17",615,[127,2268,1238,43]]]'>Count 2 is illustrative of the three counts on appeal and follows:</p>

A rotary drill including a drill stem, a core barrel rotatable with the drill stem and normally projecting below the latter, and means for detachably securing the core barrel within the stem, said means comprising a sleeve carried by the drill stem and reciprocable therein, a spring in the drill stem, and a latch <a id="p1298" href="#p1298" data-label="1298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1298</a>movably mounted on the core barrel for engaging said sleeve to prevent upward movement of the core barrel with respect to the sleeve, said spring serving to exert a downward pressure upon the sleeve and to yield upwardly when hard formations are encountered by the core barrel to permit the core barrel to withdraw into the drill stem.</blockquote>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[215,480,1324,186]]]'>The main feature of novelty as to each of the appealed, counts relates to the dog or latch ior holding the core barrel down, and the releasing means, specifically the tubelike member sliding upwardly, to retract the latch from under the abutment.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[214,682,1325,686]]]'>The interference involves the application of Oksenholt filed July 2, 1934, which is stated to be a continuation in part of an application filed June 15, 1932, and the application of Boyd filed June 20, 1933. The instant interference is one of a series of four closely related interferences, one of which was numbered JO,418, and was between the same parties, all of the interferences having a common record. In three of the interferences, John F. Bozeman was, at one time, a junior party but took no testimony and was dropped therefrom. The instant interference originally contained four counts. The Examiner of Interferences awarded priority of invention as to all counts to Boyd. Oksenholt took no appeal as to count 1 since the subject matter of that count was not disclosed in Oksenholt’s instant application, but did appeal as to the other three counts which are here involved.</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[216,1385,1323,143]]]'>Appellant here urges but one issue for our decision, which is presented in the first six of the seven reasons of appeal, the first of which reasons of appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b616-7" data-blocks='[["BL_616.7",616,[215,1555,1325,240]]]'>1. The Board of Appeals erred in not following- the established rule of law that where the real invention in separate interferences between two parties is the same and the subjects-matter of the two interferences only differ as to features which are old in the art and do not affect the essential novelty of the real invention, the award of priority in both interferences must be made to the same party.</blockquote>

He urges that the counts are void to Boyd inasmuch as he was not the inventor of the combination but that if he invented anything he invented an improvement of one feature of the combination. Fie urges that he, Oksenholt, being the inventor of the combination should have been awarded the counts in interference even though Boyd’s specific structure of the new part of the old combination is not shown in the Oksenholt original application, nor is it by the record shown to have been conceived or reduced to practice until long after Boyd had reduced the same to practice. In other words it is not contended by Oksenholt that the involved counts read upon his first patent dis<a id="p1299" href="#p1299" data-label="1299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1299</a>closure nor is it urged that it is shown by the record that he is entitled to any date for conception and reduction to practice of certain features of the involved counts prior to the undisputed dates, awarded to Boyd.</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[85,446,1326,194]]]'>Oksenholt relies chiefly for supporting authority upon the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Lincoln Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart-Warner Corp., </em><a href="/us/303/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="303 U.S. 545" data-case-ids="6142279" data-case-paths="/us/303/0545-01">303 U.

For instance, in <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia passed squarely upon patentability in announcing and applying the doctrine .of equivalency.
