He argues that his claims require the <em>entire </em>skirt to be heated and are thus patentably distinct from those of the patent. He recognizes, as he must, that his claims are not so limited in terms. He attempts, however, to read into them the limitations of his examples. Inasmuch as there is no terminal disclaimer before us, we do not feel that it is necessary to decide whether this effort is successful. It seems to us, as it did to the examiner, that even if the claims here in question define separate inventions by reason of the reading in of the example limitations, one is no more than an obvious <a id="p1613" href="#p1613" data-label="1613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1613</a>variant .of the other.

The details of his argument, however, seem to focus almost solely on establishing the separateness of the inventions. And this, of course, is not enough. Appellant has pointed to the allowance of the Dreyfus et al. claims as indicative of the necessary patentable distinction; but we cannot be-bound thereby.</p>

We cannot agree. Limitations of the invention of the patent claims to use in a conventional way or with plastic material of admittedly known desirable qualities are not unobvious limitations.

Appellant’s claims require an un-shrunken and relatively thin, central portion of the closure. Appellant compares the steps in his foi’mation of the closure with those ■of Engels to show the necessity of the differences, neither disclosure being explicit. We think, however, that the examiner correctly pointed out that these arguments would be more in point were method claims here involved. This rejection is under 85 USC 103. Whether or not Engels anticipates appellant’s closure, it seems to us that unobviousness cannot be predicated on apparently immaterial differences in thickness of the plastic material.
