Union Station Venture Corporation, hereinafter “OHIO,” is a District of Columbia corporation owned by the pension fund for Ohio State’s mox-e than 300,000 public employees. On June 9, 1989, the parties memorialized the terms of their venture in a Partnership Agreement (the “Agreement”). Among other things, the Agreement provided that OHIO was to contribute $65 million, receive a sixty percent interest in the Venture, and earn a ten percent monthly return on its investment. The JBG Partnership invested $10, secured a $750,000 managing contract, and obtained a forty percent interest in the Venture. The Agreement further provided that in certain circumstances, JBG would be hable to OHIO for losses it incurred, up to a maximum of <a id="p880" href="#p880" data-label="880" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*880</a>$10 million. A separate guaranty agreement (the “Guaranty”) was also executed holding JBG’s individual investors, the Guarantors, personally accountable for certain JBG obligations.</p>
    <p id="b934-4" data-blocks='[["BL_934.4",934,[226,467,753,512]]]'>In 1998, after a change in the District’s real estate market, JBG stopped paying OHIO’S ten percent monthly return. Additionally, OHIO’S “Capital Account,” which kept track of its Venture finances, revealed a deficit approaching $30 million. In light of these unfavorable factors, on May 12, 1993, OHIO elected to terminate the Venture pursuant to ¶21 of the Agreement — the interpretation of which is now at the center of this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b934-5" data-blocks='[["BL_934.5",934,[220,1003,756,1080]]]'>Paragraph 21 contains a buy/sell provision which, once executed, dissolves the Venture. Under its terms, an offering party sets a “venture price” that when applied to a formula set forth in the Agreement, yields two figures; the “offeror’s net venture price” and the “offeree’s net venture price.” These figures, as determined by the Agreement’s formula, represent the amount the buying party must pay for the seller’s interest in the Venture. The non-offering party then has ninety days to elect to either buy the offeror’s Venture interest (for the offeror’s net venture price), or sell its own (for the offeree’s net venture price). If no election is made within the ninety-day period, the right to select reverts to the offeror. Paragraph 21(D) also states, in part, that: “[JBG] understands and agrees that, under certain circumstances, the Net Venture Price applicable to [JBG] may be less than zero (0) and require a reimbursement from [JBG], as seller, to OHIO, as buyer.”</p>
    <p id="b934-6" data-blocks='[["BL_934.6",934,[220,2106,751,516]],["BL_934.7",934,[1026,220,751,706]]]'>As the offering party, OHIO’S May 12, 1993 notice to JBG set $40.9 million as the venture price. The parties agree that as the <em>buyer, </em>JBG owed OHIO the offeror’s net venture price plus, pursuant to the above quoted language in ¶ 21(D), approximately $8 .5 million to replenish the deficit in OHIO’S Capital Account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The parties further agree that as the <em>seller, </em>JBG’s net venture price for its interest in the Venture was zero ($0.). A disagreement arose, however, over whether JBG, as the <em>seller, </em>was still liable under the above quoted language of ¶ 21(D) for the $8.5 million reimbursement of OHIO’S Capital Account. Ninety days after OHIO’S May 12th notice, JBG made no election to buy or sell. OHIO, therefore, elected to purchase JBG’s interest and set October 12, 1993 as the closing date. At closing, JBG transferred its Venture interest to OHIO, but refused to pay the $8.5 million reimbursement. According to JBG, its “reimbursement” obligation as a <em>seller </em>under ¶ 21(D) was “oblique and indefinite” and, therefore, it had no duty to replenish OHIO’S Capital Account. Litigation ensued.</p>
    <p id="b934-9" data-blocks='[["BL_934.10",934,[1022,974,752,1134]]]'>A seven-day bench trial commenced in Superior Court; voluminous documentary evidence and witness testimony were admitted, and extensive post-trial briefs were submitted by the parties. At issue was not only the correct interpretation of JBG’s reimbursement obligation as the seller, but also whether the Guarantors were liable under the Guaranty agreement for JBG’s reimbursement liability, if any. On March 11, 1997, a twenty-one page Memorandum, Opinion and Order was issued by the court. The court concluded that JBG, as the seller, was liable under ¶ 21(D) for the reimbursement, and that the Guarantors were personally liable under the Guaranty as well. Accordingly, the court awarded OHIO $8,513,006 .94 in damages. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Following additional briefing by the parties, on June 18, 1997, the court awarded OHIO an additional $1,928,066.40 in attorney’s fees under ¶ 30(D) of the Agreement and Section 2(h) of the Guaranty. JBG and the Guarantors appealed.</p>

JBG also argues the award of attorney’s fees above and beyond its maximum $10 million in contractual liability was erroneous. Similarly, the Guarantors contest the trial court’s imposition of liability for JBG’s reimbursement under the <a id="p881" href="#p881" data-label="881" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*881</a>Guaranty, as well as the award of attorney’s fees.</p>

The relevant language states: “[JBG] understands and agrees that, under certain circumstances, the Net Venture Price applicable to [JBG] may be less than zero (0) and require a reimbursement from [JBG], as seller, to OHIO, as buyer.” As JBG contends, the meaning of “reimbursement” and the circumstances that trigger it are neither clear nor definite.

Appellee relies upon the language in the Guaranty to support its argument for fees in excess of the $10 million reimbursement provision. The trial court, finding the Agreement and Guaranty to be “coextensive,” concluded that attorney’s fees are generally above and beyond any award of damages and, relying on the Guaranty’s lan<a id="p883" href="#p883" data-label="883" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*883</a>guage, awarded fees in addition to the $8.5 million reimbursement obligation.</p>

We observe that while the Agreement is between OHIO and JBG, the Guaranty is between OHIO and the Guarantors. Thus, from the clear and unambiguous language of both contracts, any award of attorney’s fees against JBG is limited to $10 million pursuant to the Agreement, but, pursuant to the Guaranty, any award of attorney’s fees against the Guarantors is “without limitation.” Accordingly, we vacate the award of attorney’s fees against JBG to the extent it makes the full award against the partnership exceed $10 million and affirm the award of fees in the full amount against the Guarantors. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed in all respects except that the award of attorney’s fees against JBG Partnership is vacated.</p>

In their brief, the Guarantors argue that the court’s reliance on this testimony was erroneous since their attorney also testified 1121(D) did not impose reimbursement liability upon JBG as a seller in a buy/sell. To the contrary, having found ¶ 21(D) did apply to JBG, the admission by appellant’s former counsel that <em>if </em>this was the court’s holding, then the imposition of liability against the Guarantors must follow, was all the more valuable.</p>
