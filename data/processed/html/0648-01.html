Many of the factors, including the lack of multiple victims, the lack of gratuitous violence or unusual cruelty, the lack of a prior criminal history, as well as the biological relationship to the victim, and the victim’s normal mental capacity, favored Geiter.

Lastly, in partial explanation of his finding that Geiter was likely to re-offend, Dr. Stein specifically noted the fact that Geiter himself had been sexually abused as a child, and that despite his awareness of the harm this contact could cause, and his deep remorse after each episode of abuse, he was unable stop abusing his son until there was legal intervention.</p>

    <p id="b701-8" data-blocks='[["BL_701.10",701,[167,1677,752,662]]]'>¶ 1 Dr. Stein’s diagnosis was that Geiter suffered from the personality disorder, pedophilia, and all pedophiles are likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses in the future. Therefore, the third criterion, that Geiter was likely to reof-fend, was part of the evidence and justifies the SVP classification. Therefore, I do not believe it appropriate in this case to decide whether or not someone can be classified as an SVP <em>absent </em>evidence that the offender is likely to reoffend. This significant question should not be decided in dicta.</p>
