    <p id="b1393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1393.4",1393,[153,376,754,552]]]'>The jury was warranted in finding that in 1982 Mauro Danforth had an idea for developing a piece of property west of the Maine Turnpike in South Portland. He hired a production company to prepare a videotaped presentation of the property and asked an architect to produce schematic sketches of the potential development. In August 1984, because he lacked sufficient capital to acquire the property on his own, he sought participation from real estate developer Gavin Ruotolo.</p>
    <p id="b1393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1393.5",1393,[153,958,753,986]]]'>At the initial brief meeting between the two men, Danforth told Ruotolo that he had a great idea for a multiple use development near the Maine Mall and that he had prepared a videotape and some sketches of the property. Ruotolo told him not to share the information with anyone and invited him to make a full presentation a few days later. At a two-hour meeting, Danforth presented his proposal to Ruotolo, some of Ruotolo’s key employees, and a representative of the Marriott hotel chain. After the presentation, Ruotolo used him as an intermediary in negotiating the purchase of the property with the agent of the property owner. In January 1985 Ruotolo and a partner, Andrew Ross, purchased an option for the site, which they exercised later that year for $2,500,000. Ruotolo and Ross then developed the property into the Sable Oaks multiple use development and Marriott Hotel.</p>

Danforth described his expected eom-pensation as an “equity position.” Danforth never received any payment for his role in the project. After Ruotolo acquired the property, he ended his relationship with Dan-forth, refusing to take phone calls and leaving letters unanswered.</p>
    <p id="b1393-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1393.10",1393,[952,528,756,611]]]'>In March 1989 Danforth filed a six-count complaint against Ruotolo. The court <em>(Brennan, J.) </em>entered a summary judgment on four counts, leaving only a breach of contract claim and a <em>quantum meruit </em>claim. Dan-forth tried those claims to a jury in November 1993. The trial court granted Ruotolo’s motion for a judgment as a matter of law on the contract count, but denied his motion with respect to the <em>quantum meruit </em>count. The jury returned a verdict for Danforth on the <em>quantum meruit </em>count in the amount of $75,000. This appeal followed.</p>

The court instructed the jury that they must find for Danforth if he successfully proved that he rendered service to Ruotolo at Ruotolo’s request or with Ruotolo’s knowledge and consent, and that the circumstances in which he rendered the service made it reasonable for him to expect that he would receive compensation.</p>

We must determine whether by any reasonable view of the evidence, including the inferences to be drawn therefrom, taken in the light most favorable to Danforth, the verdict can be sustained. <em>See Ames v.

The evidence in this case supports the jury’s finding that Danforth rendered services to Ruotolo. Both acknowledged that Danforth presented his idea to Ruotolo and that Danforth served as an ambassador for Ruotolo in the negotiations culminating in the purchase of the property.</p>

Ruotolo attended the meeting at which Danforth made his presentation and arranged for other Ruotolo employees to attend, together with a representative from the Marriott hotel chain. In these circumstances, the jury could infer that Danforth provided these services at Ruotolo’s request, or at least with Ruotolo’s knowledge and consent.</p>
