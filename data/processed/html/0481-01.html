Consequently, the ammunition clip that police found when they searched the defendant, incident to that arrest, was lawfully obtained. Furthermore, we conclude under <em>Maryland v.

Because the police found the remaining evidence at issue — two guns and a second ammunition clip — in plain view during this lawful search, we conclude that this evidence was also lawfully seized. Accordingly, we reverse the motions judge’s suppression order and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>

Harris, with a random shooting, a grand jury charged Harris with the following offenses: first-degree, premeditated murder while armed, D.C.Code §§ 22-2401, -3202 (1989 Repl. &amp; 1992 Supp.); assault with a dangerous weapon, D.C.Code § 22-502 (1989 Repl.); possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, D.C.Code § 22-3204(b) (1992 Supp.); two counts of destruction of property D.C.Code § 22-403 (1989 Repl.); carrying a pistol without a license (D.C.Code § 22-3204(a)) (1992 Supp.); possession of an unregistered firearm, D.C.Code § 6-2311(a) (1989 Repl.); and possession of unregistered ammunition, D.C.Code § 6-2361(3) (1989 Repl.). Before trial, Harris moved to suppress physical evidence, including the 9-mm pistol believed to be the murder weapon, which the police seized in Harris’s apartment incident to his arrest.</p>

He arrived on the scene at about 6:30 or 6:35 p.m. and remained there for approximately one hour to one hour and fifteen minutes. According to Detective Sitek, witnesses at the scene said that at about 6:15 p.m. a man had accused people on the block of stealing his bicycle and had threatened to “shoot up all of Park Road” until he got the bicycle back. The man brandished what witnesses believed to be a 9-mm handgun and then began to fire <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>randomly into passing vehicles on Park Road. Next, he walked over to Rene Best, who was seated on the front step of 1319 Park Road, and fired two rounds at Best, striking and killing him. This was an unusual shooting, Sitek said, because Best “offered no resistance”; Best “was a neighborhood alcoholic who bothered absolutely nobody and could not flee the scene that day because he was intoxicated and may have been passed out from his intoxicated level.” After the shooting, the shooter continued to make threats as he left the scene, heading south on 13th Street, N.W.</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[227,933,747,871]]]'>Two of the witnesses identified the shooter as “Mario.” Eventually, that same evening, Detective Sitek learned that “Mario” might possibly be the defendant, Mark Harris, although Sitek was unable to say how he came by this information. Sitek did not believe that this information was sufficient to justify Harris's arrest. Later that evening, however, police were contacted by another witness who had been standing next to Best when Best had been shot, and Sitek arranged to meet this witness. Sometime between 2:45 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. on the morning of November 16, 1991, this witness picked out Harris’s photo from a nine-photo array and positively identified him as the shooter. At that point, Sitek believed he had probable cause to arrest Harris.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[226,1833,748,745]],["BL_534.6",534,[1029,266,743,228]]]'>Sitek obtained Harris’s address — 1372 Kenyon Street, N.W. — from the police computer. Sitek then decided to go directly to 1372 Kenyon Street to arrest Harris, without first obtaining a warrant. Although Sitek could not be sure that Harris would be at home, Sitek thought that he might find Harris there at that time of the morning. Sitek testified that he did not take the time to seek a warrant, which could have taken between one and three hours to accomplish, because he felt that it was important to apprehend Harris as soon as possible. In particular, Sitek cited the violence of the crime, the witness’s positive identification of Harris as the shooter, the fact that the shooting had been unprovoked, the shooter’s general threats against the Park Road residents, and his belief that Harris was still armed and in the area, as contributing factors in this decision.</p>
    <p id="b534-8" data-blocks='[["BL_534.7",534,[1023,523,749,1172]]]'>It took Sitek until 3:30 or 3:45 a.m. to assemble an arrest team of ten to twelve police officers. The team arrived at 1372 Kenyon at about 3:50 or 3:55 a.m. Some of the officers went to the back of the building to guard the rear window of Harris’s apartment. According to Sitek, the remaining officers proceeded to the locked front door of the building, buzzed someone to gain entry, identified themselves as police officers, and were admitted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> They then went to Harris’s apartment, number 101, and knocked. Harris’s mother opened the door. The officers identified themselves and asked to speak with Harris. Harris’s mother answered that he was in back, in his room; she pointed to the rear of the apartment. The officers then entered the apartment and walked down an L-shaped hallway toward Harris’s bedroom. Partway down the hall, they encountered Harris as he was leaving his bedroom. Si-tek announced, “We’re police officers, freeze,” and pointed his weapon at Harris. The officers then arrested Harris.</p>
    <p id="b534-9" data-blocks='[["BL_534.8",534,[1022,1729,745,848]],["BL_535.1",535,[179,225,745,266]]]'>Thereafter, Sitek and another officer, Officer Bailey, went into Harris’s bedroom to make sure that no one else was there. Sitek admitted that he did not have any information indicating that there might be anyone else in that bedroom who might pose a danger to the police. Nevertheless, the police decided to “check out” the bedroom for their own safety. In order to do so, Sitek said, the police actually had to enter the bedroom, because it contained a blind corner and a closet. Once inside the bedroom, Sitek saw an ammunition clip on a bookshelf. When Sitek went to the far side of the bed to make sure that no one was hiding between the bed and the wall, he also noticed a weapon next to the bed. Sitek did not remove these items; instead, <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>Sitek left an officer posted to secure the room, while he went to obtain an emergency search warrant. While Sitek was preparing the warrant papers, however, he received a call informing him that Harris had consented to a search.</p>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[180,519,746,1165]]]'>Officer Gregory Bailey and Lieutenant Philip Michaels essentially corroborated Si-tek's testimony concerning the events at Harris’s apartment. Bailey testified that he had heard a “thump” coming from the bedroom, which he believed might be the sound of Harris dropping a gun on the floor, just before Harris emerged from the bedroom. Bailey told Harris to come out, and Harris did so. Bailey then had Harris put his hands on the hallway wall. Bailey quickly frisked Harris and felt what he thought was a pistol magazine in Harris’s pocket. After telling Lieutenant Michaels about the magazine, Bailey turned Harris over to Michaels. Bailey then went into Harris’s bedroom, turned on the light, and searched the bedroom to make sure no one else was in there. Inside the bedroom, Bailey saw an ammunition clip on the shelves and two weapons in plain view between the bed and the wall next to the bed, a 9-mm pistol and a “Tec-9” semiautomatic pistol. Shortly thereafter, Detective Si-tek entered.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[181,1712,747,747]],["BL_535.6",535,[974,221,746,128]]]'>Lieutenant Michaels testified that another officer had found an ammunition magazine in the defendant’s pocket while the two were patting Harris down in the hall outside of the bedroom. Lieutenant Mi-chaels handcuffed Harris and then, within about a minute, escorted him outside the apartment into the building’s hallway. There, apparently after the initial sweep of Harris’s bedroom had already taken place, Michaels obtained Harris’s consent to search the apartment. The government introduced a preprinted form, signed by Harris and countersigned by Michaels, which informed Harris of his right to withhold consent to a search and authorized police to search the entire apartment. According to Michaels, Harris signed the form a little after 4:00 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b535-8" data-blocks='[["BL_535.7",535,[973,376,748,613]]]'>Dovie Dozier, Harris’s mother, testified for the defense. She said that at about 4:00 a.m. she heard a knock on the door and the announcement “Police. Open up.” When she did so, she saw the police with guns pointing at the door. She admitted that she had not sought to refuse police entry and that she had told them that Harris was inside. She testified, however, that the police never requested permission to enter or search the apartment and that she had never voluntarily granted consent to the entry or search.</p>
    <p id="b535-9" data-blocks='[["BL_535.8",535,[975,1011,748,612]]]'>Harris himself testified that he had been awakened by the knock at the door. He heard his mother say the police were at the door, so he got up and left his room to investigate. He met the police in the hall leading to his bedroom. Harris further testified that a police officer who said he had found a clip in Harris’s pocket struck Harris on the head with it. Harris also testified that he had signed the consent form because the police had told him they had already found what they had come looking for.</p>
    <p id="b535-10" data-blocks='[["BL_535.9",535,[975,1645,748,276]]]'>Harris’s sister, Brenda Harris, also testified. She said that she had seen the search of her brother’s room, that her brother’s bed was located “against the wall,” and that she had seen a detective reach behind her brother’s bed to retrieve a gun.</p>

The judge concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest Harris.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Because the police did not seek a warrant, however, the judge determined that their entry both into the common hallway of the apartment building <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and then into Harris’s apartment <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>was presumptively illegal unless permitted by consent or justified by exigent circumstances. With regard to the consent issue, the judge concluded that: (1) because of the conflicting testimony about how the police entered the apartment building, <em>see supra </em>note 2, the government had failed to establish that the police had entered the building with consent; (2) the police entry into Harris’s apartment had been coerced; (3) even if the entry into the apartment had not been coerced, the police nonetheless lacked any basis for entering Harris’s bedroom; and (4) the consent form signed by Harris did not validate the search that had already taken place. The motions judge also concluded that the government had failed to show exigent circumstances sufficient to justify entry into either the building or the apartment. In reaching this ruling, however, the motions judge did <em>not </em>expressly apply all the relevant criteria, as set forth in our caselaw, for determining when there are exigent circumstances. The only findings on that issue were that the entry had been made ten hours after the offense and without any information showing that Harris would be at home.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[215,1598,749,705]]]'>On appeal, the government does not contest the motions judge’s ruling that the police entered Harris’s apartment without consent. Nor does it argue that Harris consented to the search of his bedroom. The government contends, however, that (1) the warrantless entry to arrest Harris was lawful because of the exigent circumstances of the case and that (2) once inside the apartment, the police were entitled to search Harris’s bedroom as part of the arrest procedure. The government also argues that Harris did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the building’s common hallway.</p>

Furthermore, both before and after the killing the shooter had threatened to “shoot up all of Park Road until he got his bicycle back.” Both the killing and the random shots at passing cars made it clear that this threat, however extravagant, was all too real. Thus, the police had reason to believe that they were dealing not just with a murderer, but with a mentally unbalanced individual whose actions would be difficult to predict and who might well kill again if not apprehended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Indeed, given the particular irra<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>tionality of the earlier killing, police would have had some basis for fearing that Harris might fire on them or others in order to resist arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Merely surrounding the building and waiting to see whether Harris eventually emerged was not a workable alternative.

Harris’s mother testified that the police knocked on her door at 4:00 a.m. Thus, at most one hour and a quarter elapsed between the time that the police decided to make the arrest and the time that they entered the Harris apartment.

The police had probable cause to arrest Harris and reason to believe that he was extremely dangerous, unpredictable, and a continuing threat to the community. They also had grounds for thinking that Harris would be armed and some basis for believing that he would be on the premises even before Harris’s mother confirmed this suspicion. While there was no evidence that Harris was likely to escape, this was counterbalanced by the strong police interest in determining whether Harris was in fact on the premises, in protecting residents of the apartment building, and in preserving evidence. Finally, there is no evidence that the police delayed unreasonably in executing their plan once they had decided to arrest Harris.

First, we conclude under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, as formulated in <em>Dorman, Minick, </em>and <em>Derrington, </em>that the police were entitled to enter Harris’s building and apartment to arrest Harris, especially given the evidence suggesting that he was a random and unpredictable killer who might strike again, without provocation, if not apprehended as soon as possible. Consequently, the arrest of Harris was lawful and the <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>evidence obtained from his person was admissible because it resulted from a search incident to arrest. Second, we conclude under <em>Buie </em>that the police, having begun the process of arresting Harris in the apartment’s interior hallway, could properly make a protective sweep of Harris’s bedroom (even though they lacked any specific, articulable basis for suspecting that someone else was in there who might endanger their safety), because the bedroom was an adjoining space from which an attack might be launched.

This court’s rule that a motion for reconsideration does not toll the time for filing a criminal appeal is contrary to federal practice. <em>See United States v. Ibarra, </em>— U.S. -, <a href="/us/502/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="112 S.

Although federal court interpretation of federal procedural rules commonly informs this court’s interpretation of its similar rules, we have also made clear that a federal interpretation is not binding on this court's interpretation of its own rules. <em>See West v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/346/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="346 A.2d 504" data-case-ids="8065615" data-case-paths="/a2d/346/0504-01">346 A.2d 504</a>, 506 (D.C.1975). In light of the Supreme Court’s recent <em>Ibarra </em>decision, however, we believe this court should reconsider its "no tolling” rule.</p>
