Cruz’s first argument is that the Superior Court erred in finding that Cruz had violated the terms of his probation. According to Cruz, it was improper for the judge to consider evidence presented to a jury at Cruz’s criminal trial presided over by the same judge the preceding week that resulted in Cruz’s acquittal on all charges. Cruz’s second argument is that the judge who presided over Cruz’s VOP hearing sentenced him with a “closed mind.”</p>

After a four-day trial, the jury acquitted Cruz of all charges. Cruz testified that when police first arrived at the bar, he believed that he was being arrested for a curfew violation, and was shocked to hear that his arrest was for trafficking in MDMA. Cruz denied owning the ecstasy pills and testified that he only told police that he was brokering a sale of the pills because he was being pressured to do so. Cruz also denied being aware of the cocaine found in the pocket of a shirt hanging in his room.</p>

Cruz was sentenced to two years incarceration at Level V, suspended after eighteen months for a period of probation.</p>

    <p id="b458-16" data-blocks='[["BL_458.13",458,[1010,1231,753,809]]]'>The judge increased Cruz’s sentence from Level III supervision to eighteen months of incarceration at Level V. “Appellate review of a sentence is limited to whether the sentence is within the statutory limits prescribed by the General Assembly and whether it is based on factual predicates which are false, impermissible, or lack minimal reliability, judicial vindictiveness or bias, or a closed mind.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_30" id="ref_footnote_1_30">30</a> Cruz argues that the judge sentenced him with a closed mind. “A judge sentences with a closed mind when the sentence is based on a preconceived bias without consideration of the nature of the offense or the character of the defendant.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_31" id="ref_footnote_1_31">31</a>
