The victim and Riley met on a dinner date arranged by mutual friends. Two days after this date, they arranged to meet after the victim finished work at a Philadelphia restaurant. Riley picked up the victim at 2:20 a.m., however as they drove in his car the victim explained she was tired from eight hours of work and asked for a rain check. Riley, who also claimed to be tired, asked the victim if he could sleep in her one-room studio apartment. The victim agreed and both went into the apartment. While appellant lay on the bed watching television, the victim showered and changed into her nightwear, which consisted of underwear, a T-shirt, a knee-length nightshirt and a robe. Riley asked if he could remove his pants so he could be more comfortable and the victim said yes. She got into bed and removed her robe, whereas Riley got under the blankets and asked for and received a goodnight kiss.</p>

The victim resisted, ordering Riley to stop. She moved her head from side to side in an attempt to avoid his lips. He resisted her pleas, telling the victim to “relax, go with it.” The testimony revealed Riley was approximately seven inches taller and thirty pounds heavier than the victim, however, despite being pinioned, the victim grabbed Riley’s hips attempting to push him off her body. As he removed her underwear and penetrated her, the victim pleaded to stop and get off her. Riley kept moving about until he ejaculated.</p>

That afternoon, the victim went to the hospital for an examination. Riley went to the hospital and again apologized to the victim, stating he “... didn’t mean to force her to have sex and rape her....” Furthermore, he assured the victim he was going to seek help from Naval authorities, as he was a Navy enlistee, and offered to pay her medical bills.</p>

Riley exerted enough force to overcome any resistance by the victim. The victim refused to have sexual intercourse, however, Riley forcibly compelled her to do so by laying on top of her, pinning her with his body weight. He thwarted her attempts to resist sexual contact and then penetrated her. This is plainly forcible compulsion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Meadows, </em><a href="/pa-super/381/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="381 Pa.

Moreover, Riley’s repeated apologies, subsequent admissions and promise to seek help confirm that he recognized the intercourse was forcible.

Specifically, the Rape Shield Law was implicated when mention of the victim’s pregnancy (which she allegedly discovered shortly after the rape) was elicited by the Commonwealth on direct examination. According to the record, the victim intended to have an abortion and wanted Riley to pay for it. He agreed to pay and later sent part of the requested money to the victim. On cross-examination, Riley’s counsel attempted to explore the circumstances of the pregnancy and the fact the victim requested $500 for the abortion but received only $200. However, the Commonwealth objected to the questions, which were sustained <a id="p1093" href="#p1093" data-label="1093" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1093</a>by the trial court as being in violation of the Rape Shield Law.</p>
    <p id="b1159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1159.4",1159,[166,348,755,1103]]]'>During post-trial motions, the trial judge determined that the evidence excluded by sustaining the Commonwealth’s objections was obviously intended to show fabrication of the forcible rape charge in an attempt to compel Riley to pay for her abortion. Thus, by admitting evidence of the victim’s pregnancy, which might have been inadmissible without a Rape Shield motion if offered by Riley, the Commonwealth cannot object to him attempting to expand upon that evidence to show the victim’s bias. In other words, had the Commonwealth not “opened the door” on this point, Riley would not have been permitted to raise it without filing a proper motion. The Commonwealth alleges this cross-examination is exploration into pri- or sexual activity prohibited by the Rape Shield Law. However, the Commonwealth ignores its role in placing the matter in issue, which nullifies the Rape Shield Law requirement of a prior written motion and hearing on the issue. Accordingly, the court granted a new trial.</p>

The trial court was well within its discretion to grant a new trial when there existed prejudicial error in denying the defendant his right to cross-examination on an issue which dealt with motive or bias raised on direct examination by the Commonwealth.

As the lower court notes, however, no specific proffer was made in regard to the proposed cross-examination. The nature of the questions posed by the defense on cross-examination indicate that the testimony sought would obviously have delved into areas prohibited by the Rape Shield Law.

The defense made no specific proffer at trial, or at any time since then, of the evidence which he intended to elicit from such inquiry. On the other hand, the inquiry itself provided full opportunity for speculation and innuendo concerning the prior sexual history of the victim. The fact that the ease was not tried before a jury seems to have had little effect in minimizing the prejudicial nature of the defense’ attempt to inquire into rape shield protected areas. Indeed, the trial court, who was the trier of fact in the instant case, granted appellee a new trial on the basis of the exclusion of the protected evidence, even though appellee did not raise a specific proffer of evidence at trial or in post-verdict motions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The trial court’s <em>sua sponte </em>granting of a new trial on this basis keenly demonstrates the powerful prejudicial nature of inquiries by the defense into the past sexual history of a female rape complainant. <em>See Commonwealth v.

However, the testimony which the defense apparently sought on cross-examination <em>(i.e., </em>that appellee or someone other than him had impregnated the victim prior to the alleged rape incident) would have been incredibly <a id="p1095" href="#p1095" data-label="1095" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1095</a>weak in light of the other testimony of record.
