Common pleas affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board (ZHB) of Lower Merion Township. Common pleas affirmed the grant of a special exception for the expansion of facilities at the school and reversed the ZHB’s refusal to allow the school to “blend” the impervious cover allowance in each of the two zoning districts applicable on the “split zoned” lot. Common pleas’ order allows Baldwin to place more impervious cover on the R-3 portion of the lot by utilizing the allowance for impervious cover on the relatively undeveloped R-7 portion. Neighbors contend that the special exception for expansion of the facilities should be denied because Baldwin failed to show compliance with parking or loading/queuing area requirements and cannot comply with the impervious cover limits on the R-3 area of the lot without blending, which the ZHB properly refused to allow.</p>

The site contains the former Bryn Mawr Hotel, a building designed by Frank Furness, built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in the 19th Century at the height of the “Gilded Age,” listed on the National Register of Historic Places and considered by the Township to be a Class I Historic Resource. The school presently maintains a number of classroom buildings, gymnasium and pools, residences, tennis courts and athletic fields. Approximately 3.4 <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>acres of the lot lies in the R-7 district, where the ordinance limits impervious cover to 40% of a lot developed for the purpose proposed by Baldwin. A total of approximately 29,610 square feet remains available on the R-7 portion of the lot for additional impervious cover. The remainder of the lot, approximately 21 acres, lies in the R-3 district, where only a maximum of 28% of a lot may be covered. Almost all of the existing structures are located on the R-3 portion of the site. Therefore, a total of only 4,342 square feet remains available for impervious cover on the R-3 portion of the lot.</p>

Baldwin’s development plan calls for the relocation of a driveway and the lower school playground, the demolition of a garage, clubhouse and portion of the lower school building, and the addition of seventeen parking spaces.

The ZHB recognized that, as a pre-existing nonconformity, Baldwin provides less than the number of on-campus parking spaces required under the current ordinance. However, the ZHB concluded that, under Ordinance Section 155-95, the school need only provide additional parking to accommodate the expanded facilities and that the proposed additional spaces satisfied this requirement. The ZHB concluded, as it had in ruling on the 2001 application, that the boundary tolerance provision could not be applied because the proposed development occurred in the more restrictive R-3 zone rather the less restrictive R-7 zone. Further, the ZHB concluded that the ordinance does not authorize blending. Based on these findings and conclusions, the ZHB granted a special exception for the expansion of the facilities subject to conditions regarding visual screening and lighting. The ZHB also attached several conditions to mitigate parking and traffic congestion: limiting spectator occupancy at the new gym to 250 persons and at the natatorium to 100 persons; prohibiting groups not associated with Baldwin School from using the facilities without prior approval of the Board; and requiring Baldwin to engage parking attendants for simultaneous use of the gym, natatorium and/or squash courts for competitive events. The ZHB denied zoning boundary extension and blending of the impervious cover limits, stating: “Applicant shall meet impervious surface limitations of the Code without the extended regulations under Code § 155-8 and without ‘blending’ the impervious surface limits in the two zoning districts.” ZHB Order of July 22, 2004.</p>

Common pleas noted that it had not set forth its reasons for reversing the conditional use and it could not be assumed that its ruling amounted to a rejection of the Board’s expression of agreement with the blending theory. Common pleas rejected the ZHB’s conclusion that the boundary tolerance provision only applied to extend the less restricted regulations applicable in R-7 if the development occurred in the less restricted R-7 area of the site.

According to the Neighbors, compliance with subsection (G), which calls for “at least one parking space for each five seats or for each 50 square feet of floor area where fixed seating is not installed,” requires provision of 50 spaces in association with the gym that has seating for at least 250 persons and 16 spaces for the pool, which has seating for at least 80 persons. In addition, compliance with subsection (T),' which calls for “at least six parking spaces for each tennis, racquetball, squash, handball, basketball or volleyball court plus one parking space for each 200 square feet of gross floor area, or fraction thereof, devoted to lounge areas, exercise rooms, meeting facilities, sale of goods or similar public uses,” requires provision of at least 60 spaces.

Review of the record discloses ample evidence to support the finding that the additional facilities will not bring significant additional participants or spectators to the campus. Rather, the new facilities will serve the existing athletic programs. Thus, additional parking spaces are not needed to accommodate additional students, participants, faculty or staff. On behalf of Baldwin, Richard Orth, of Orth, Rodgers and Associates, testified to this effect, and the ZHB deemed his testimony both credible and more persuasive than that submitted in opposition. Orth explained that his firm conducted parking and traffic surveys in November of 2002 and April of 2003. Based on observations of excess parking availability during the school day and after school, including an afternoon when the school hosted a middle school softball game and a junior varsity lacrosse game, Orth opined that the additional 17 proposed parking spaces would adequately serve the school’s needs. ZHB Hearing December 4, 2003, N.T. at 44-50. When questioned about the need for additional parking to accommodate participants or spectators for tennis or squash competitions, which Baldwin had not been capable of hosting prior to construction of the new facilities, Orth opined that the proposed additional parking will be more than adequate.

Neighbors contend that significant additional parking (50 spaces) must be provided under subsection 155-95AA(3) for the additional assembly space provided in the new gym. Deferring to the ZHB’s interpretation of its ordinance, <em>see City of Hope v.

This interpretation avoids the unreasonable result of requiring an entirely newly built campus to accommodate parking only for the largest assembly place while requiring campuses that add buildings over time to provide substantially more parking.

In any event, Baldwin proposes in its plans to provide some additional loading/queuing space and nothing in the record establishes that more is required.</p>
    <p id="b346-12" data-blocks='[["BL_346.12",346,[990,742,756,1806]]]'>With respect to the boundary tolerance provision and Baldwin’s request to blend impervious cover regulations, Neighbors argue that the ZHB -properly denied the request to extend the less restrictive R-7 regulations a distance of 100 feet into the R-3 area of the lot because Baldwin did not propose to locate the development in the R-7 area of the lot. Neighbors further argue that, inasmuch as the boundary tolerance provision contains no language even suggesting authorization to blend impervious cover regulations on a split zoned lot, common pleas erred in permitting Baldwin to blend on the R-3 area of the lot all of the remaining impervious cover allowance. The gist of the dispute focuses on whether the language in the Boundary Tolerance provision stating “the regulations applicable to the less restrictive district shall extend <em>over the portion of the lot in the more restricted district” </em>works to essentially move the district boundary line to increase the area on the lot zoned R-7, while limiting all R-7 regulations to application only on that portion of the lot, or whether it works to affect the overall calculation of impervious cover on the entire lot by enlarging the area subject to a 28% cover limit. To reach the latter interpretation, common pleas looked to the particular regulations in each district, which limit impervious cover on a lot as a whole, to conclude that impervious cover limits can be averaged on a split zoned lot.</p>

In determining how to apply area and bulk restrictions limiting coverage to 70% <em>of a lot </em>in the C-2 district and 30% <em>of a lot </em>in the R-7 district, the court applied the restrictions to the total undivided lot rather than the respective portions in each district and ruled that “the permissible building area would be 70% of the C-2 zone including the automatic 50 feet extension and 30% of the R-7 zone excluding the aforesaid 50 feet.” The court explained further:</p>

Thus the actual building must be restricted to the use zone to which the building is applicable. In other words, in this specific instance, the appellants desire to erect a building covering an area of 9869.75 square feet. The C-2 zone including the automatic 50 feet extension is 135 feet by 92 feet or 12,420 square feet. Seventy percent thereof is 8,694 square feet. The R-7 area exclusive of the foregoing 50 feet automatic extension is 135 feet by 150 feet or 20,250 square feet. Thirty percent thereof is 6,075 square feet. Thus the total permissible building area for the lot is 14,769 square feet.
