The jury in that trial returned verdicts of murder in the first degree as to each victim. A separate sentencing hearing was held, and the jury fixed Appellant’s sentences at death for the murders of Myndie McKoy and Karima Saunders, and at life imprisonment for the murder of Sharon Saunders. Post-trial motions were considered and denied, and an automatic direct appeal was presented to this Court.

He then went into Myndie McKoy’s room to tie her up. When she awoke and began to scream, he found a knife and stabbed her in order to quiet her and tied her up. He then dragged her into the bathroom and filled the tub with water. She pleaded with him to leave her alone and she promised not to tell anyone and again began to scream, and then Appellant plunged Myndie’s head under the water in the tub and held it there until Myndie no longer moved. Having permanently silenced Myndie, he dragged her body into Sharon’s bedroom and laid her corpse next to Sharon. Appellant also admitted that he killed Sharon’s two-year-old baby, Kari-ma, by strangulation and drowning because the baby was awakened by the commotion and called out for her mother.

The basis of this claim is the Legislature’s amendment of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h), which was effective December 21, 1988. Prior to the amendment of Section 9711(h), if this Court determined that a sentence of death must be vacated, we were required to remand for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. However, the amendment of Section 9711(h) now allows this Court to remand for a new sentencing hearing rather than for the imposition of a life sentence, unless the sentence is vacated because it is disproportionate or none of the aggravating circumstances are supported by sufficient evidence. Since the amendment to Section 9711(h) became effective during the pendency of Appellant’s previous appeal to this Court, and specifically provided for application to all cases and appeals pending at that time, this Court remanded for a new sentencing hearing instead of a life sentence, once it was determined that one of the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury was not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>

In support of this proposition Appellant contends that this Court’s application of amended Section 9711(h) applies to events occurring before its enactment, and also provides for a more onerous sanction than previously existed, since a remand for a new sentencing hearing instead of a sentence of life, could, and in fact did, result in a sentence of death. <em>Weaver v.

In further support of this contention, Appellant alleges that the trial court improperly commented on Appellant’s failure to take the witness stand.

Now, in this case if you go back to jury selection, you will remember everybody said, including defense counsel, that the defendant had been found guilty by a jury of three counts of murder in the first degree.

The record reveals nothing except that the trial court responded to this confusion with reasonable emphasis and proper instructions on the legal concepts involved. It is devoid of any basis for concluding that the trial court expressed its personal opinion in this instance or that Appellant was prejudiced, especially in light of the trial court’s previous comprehensive instructions concerning the jury’s duty to decide the case themselves.
