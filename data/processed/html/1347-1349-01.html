Further, Rhode Island has a substantial governmental interest in applying § 3-11-1 to defendant, a Rhode Island licensee, for its dispensation of intoxicating liquors in violation of state law. In dram shop actions arising out of automobile accidents, the place where the liquor was unlawfully sold is of greater significance than the location of the accident because, when an intoxicated person is driving, the actual site of the crash is largely fortuitous. <em>See Patton v. Carnrike, </em><a href="/f-supp/510/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="510 F.

Boulevard Billiard Club is a Rhode Island corporation subject to the law of this state. Under that law, a vendor of alcoholic beverages is liable to persons suffering injury at the hands of intoxicated persons to whom they have supplied alcoholic beverages in violation of title 3. If this court were to allow Rhode Island liquor vendors to escape the liability imposed by § 3-11-1 simply because the resulting accident occurred outside state borders, the consequences of title 3 violations would be unpredictable indeed.</p>

Although the actual collision occurred in Massachusetts, the wrongdoing on which liability against defendant is premised took place in Rhode Island.

The element of stability necessary to support the settlement of controversies requires that we give significant deference to the terms of a general release until we have been furnished with an adequate reason to do otherwise. This adequate reason must be based upon factual evidence concerning the intention of the parties (and for this purpose a relaxation of the parol-evidence rule may well be required), as well as the nature of the consideration paid, and the existence of material mistake, fraud, misrepresentation, or overreaching.

We direct that a hearing be held including the taking of evidence, if necessary, and that findings of fact and conclusions of law be made with respect to the execution of the release.
