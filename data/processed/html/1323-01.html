The judgment arises from a collision involving appellee and a District employee. On appeal, the District argues that there was no evidence upon which a jury could find that appellant had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, and thus, the trial court should have granted the District’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

Appellee stood in the street near the car door on the driver’s side. After looking to see if any cars were coming, appellee opened the door slightly in order to get a box of literature out of the back seat of his two-door sedan.

Appellee stated, “my left knee was in the door jam ... I bent down ... without putting my head in the car....” While bringing the box out of the car, he heard a man scream.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellee stood up and saw a pick-up truck approximately one-half to one car length away.

He noted that the traffic <a id="p1325" href="#p1325" data-label="1325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1325</a>was congested due to many parked cars on both sides of the street. All of a sudden, Mr. Genus noticed the driver’s side door of a parked car open, and he yelled at the driver to stop. The pick-up track was “at the rear of the car” when Mr. Genus noticed the car door open. The driver immediately tried to stop but hit the door of the parked ear and pinned the appellee between the car door and the pick-up track.</p>

Huysman’s testimony saying that he looked down the street and could see one-half to three-quarters of a block affords a reasonable inference that traffic coming toward him had an unobstructed view of him. Genus’ testimony did not contradict that evidence; he never said that the view from the driver’s point of view was obstructed. Given that distance, the Court is of the opinion that the jury could have reasonably found that a driver ... should have seen Huys-man as he walked to his door, opened it, and stooped down to get his box. It would have been reasonable for a jury to infer that neither Genus nor the driver saw this entire sequence of events, for Genus never saw a person until after the collision and had to yell to get the driver’s attention after he saw the door “open”....</blockquote>

There is no evidence that the driver was aware of the danger to appellee or should have been aware of such danger, as required in <em>Felton. </em>Appellee crossed M Street, approached his car, and looked to see if the traffic was clear before opening the car door. He testified, “I went to the door. The closest <em>cars </em>I saw that were coming to me were at least a half to three-quarter of the block down. There was <em>cars, </em>and the <em>cars </em>still moved, I guess slowly....” The trial court stated that this was the point at which the peril began, <em>i.e., </em>when the appellee opened the door for the first time to lean into his car.</p>

Mr. Genus never testified about his ability or inability to see what was going on one-half to three-quarters of a block down the street, and appellee presented no additional evidence to prove that the driver should have been aware of appellee’s peril. The trial court mistakenly believed that ap-pellee’s testimony that he looked down the street and saw cars one-half to three-quarters of a block away meant that the pick-up truck had an unobstructed view of appellee as he approached his car. On the contrary, however, this is sheer speculation. There was no testimony that the appellant’s vehicle was leading the cars that were one-half to three-quarters of a block away or that the pick-up truck was even on M Street at that time.

    <p id="b1385-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1385.10",1385,[179,2133,751,611]]]'>There was only one piece of evidence that the District’s driver had a last clear chance to avoid the accident: the plaintiffs testimony that, before reaching into his car, he had seen cars coming toward him from a distance of one-half to three-quarters of a block down the street. According to the plaintiff — and to the trial court — this testimony permitted the jury to infer that, if the plaintiff had seen cars that far away, then the District’s driver also could have seen the plaintiff from virtually the same distance away, <em>i.e., </em>from far enough away to have avoided the collision.</p>
    <p id="b1385-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1385.11",1385,[975,232,758,1214]]]'>The problem with such an inference, however, is that the plaintiff had seen several “cars,” implying at best for the plaintiff that there had been several vehicles down the block, with the District’s truck somewhere in line — but not in front (no “truck” was mentioned). Accordingly, the evidence was simply too sparse for the jury to have reasonably inferred that the District’s truck driver could have seen past the other vehicles in time to “have avoided injuring the plaintiff after he became aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, the danger and the plaintiffs inability to extricate himself from it.” <em>Robinson v.

Even though the testimony indicates that the traffic was coming no faster than ten to twelve miles per hour, there was no expert testimony or any other record basis for the jury reasonably to have found that the driver could have seen the plaintiff and stopped in time, even though other vehicles in front may have blocked his view for awhile before impact.</p>

But the fourth element of the last clear chance doctrine brings within it an antecedently negligent defendant who, “with means available to him, could have avoided injuring the [contrib-utorily negligent] plaintiff after he became aware of, <em>or reasonably should have become aware of, </em>the danger and the plaintiffs inability to extricate himself from it.” <em>Robinson v. District of Columbia, </em><a href="/a2d/580/1255-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="580 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="7380005" data-case-paths="/a2d/580/1255-01">580 A.2d 1255</a>, 1258-59 (D.C.1990) <em>(Robinson I) </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also District of Columbia v.

The same caution by which he could have avoided the accident— <em>i.e., </em>keeping a careful lookout on a street narrowed by cars parked on both sides— reasonably should have made him aware of the plaintiffs presence in the street in time to stop. But to recognize this fact is, practically speaking, to say that there is no difference between primary negligence of the defendant and his liability (for unreasonably failing to “become aware”) under last clear chance. Our reversal in this case is in the nature of a rear guard action against the obliteration of that distinction.</p>

Ideally, that examination — including evaluation of the experience in the many jurisdictions that have adopted one form or another of comparative fault — would be done by a body akin to our now-defunct District of Columbia Law Revision Commission, if not by the Council of the District of Columbia itself. Assuming this does not take place, then the judges of this court should take a hard look at whether there are not more rational principles by which to resolve these cases in which so often the fault of both parties is obvious to judges as well as juries.</p>
