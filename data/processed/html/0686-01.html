The employee told the officers that some men had just left the bar with an open beer container and boarded a boat known as the Janice Ann. The officers pursued the vessel, stopped it and boarded. The officers did not observe any erratic or unusual driving nor did the bar employee indicate that any of the men was under the influence. As Appellee came down the <a id="p687" href="#p687" data-label="687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*687</a>ladder from the “flying bridge”,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Detective Powell detected an odor of alcohol. Appel-lee failed the field sobriety tests and was arrested and charged with boating under the influence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellee was returned to shore by a waterways conservation officer. Based on this evidence, the suppression court found that the sole purpose in making the stop was to investigate suspected criminal activity. Since the officers did not have probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was taking place, the court found the stop and boarding of the boat was unlawful under both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. We agree with the trial court that the stop and boarding of the Janice Ann violated Article 1 § 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. We need not therefore discuss whether the stop violated the United States Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The sole issue before the Court was whether the trial court should have, suppressed evidence seized when the defendant’s tractor-trailer was searched without a warrant shortly after the accident. The Supreme Court determined that the suppression court erred in failing to suppress the evidence, stating “The police cannot conduct a warrantless administrative search to advance a criminal investigation under the pretext of addressing a specific, compelling governmental interest advanced by a statutory scheme.” <em><a href="/a2d/738/0993-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="738 A.2d 993" data-case-ids="11571685,11571756,838532,838558" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0993-01,/a2d/738/0993-02,/pa/558/0565-01,/pa/558/0564-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/738/0993-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="738 A.2d 993" data-case-ids="11571685,11571756,838532,838558" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0993-01,/a2d/738/0993-02,/pa/558/0565-01,/pa/558/0564-01">at 1003-4</a>.

As the United States Supreme Court has explained, a finding that officers could stop and board “unsuspect” vessels for inspection but not suspect vessels, would lead to an “incongruous result.” <em>Villamonte-Marquez, </em>at 584, <a href="/us/462/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="462 U.S. 579" data-case-ids="6190962" data-case-paths="/us/462/0579-01">103 S.Ct. 2573</a> (citation omitted). Accordingly, I reject the trial court’s legal conclusions that the stop was not a valid one pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=14%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2089" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="14 U.S.C. § 89">14 U.S.C. § 89</a>(a), and therefore that appel-lee’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated. I find, instead, the officers had statutory authority to conduct the stop and their ulterior motive did not invalidate it.</p>
    <p id="b719-5" data-blocks='[["BL_719.6",719,[158,1125,755,1339]]]'>¶ 5 In determining the scope of Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the trial court considered four factors: (1) the text of the Pennsylvania Constitution provision; (2) the history of the provision; (3) related case-law from other states; and (4) policy considerations. Trial Court Opinion, at 7-11, <em>see also Commonwealth v. Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">526 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d 887</a> (1991). In its analysis of the fourth factor, the court concluded that pursuant to the various provisions of 30 Pa.C.S.A. § 901 Powers and duties of waterways conservation officers and deputies, waterways officers need no level of suspicion to stop vessels for boat and boating regulations relating to Part III of the statute, but beyond that, must have probable cause in order to stop/board a vessel for other purposes. <em>See, </em>§ 901(a)(5), (a)(10). The court concluded, therefore, that the Pennsylvania General Assembly’s legislative intent, as reflected by the statute, restricts executive branch power once the search goes beyond document and/or safety inspections. Trial Court Opinion at 10.</p>

Officer Job-czyski is an officer of the United States Coast Guard and not of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. His authority, therefore, is not circumscribed by Section 901. Although Officer Jobczyski was accompanied by a Water Conservation Officer and Erie County detective, I do not believe this invalidated the stop. <em>See Villamonte-Marquez, <a href="/us/462/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="462 U.S. 579" data-case-ids="6190962" data-case-paths="/us/462/0579-01">supra, </a></em><a href="/us/462/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="462 U.S. 579" data-case-ids="6190962" data-case-paths="/us/462/0579-01">at 584</a>, <a href="/us/462/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="462 U.S. 579" data-case-ids="6190962" data-case-paths="/us/462/0579-01">103 S.Ct. 2573</a> (finding an otherwise valid stop of a vessel by customs officers was not invalidated because the officers were accompanied by state policemen, and were following an informant’s tip that the vessel was thought to be carrying drugs).</p>
