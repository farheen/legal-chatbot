At the hearing, it was learned that Manley paid his Nationwide automobile insurance policy premium through a monthly payment plan. Pursuant to that arrangement, on October 8, 1999 Manley forwarded a check in the amount of $80.44 to his Nationwide agent together with the billing document. (Notes of Testimony February 2, 2000, p. 95.) Rather than process the payment per the usual arrangements Nationwide returned the check to Manley together with a note from the agent indicating that the account was paid in full until November 7, 1999, and advising Manley that a $182.60 payment was required for him to return to the monthly payment plan. (Notes of Testimony, February 2, 2000, p. 95; Original Record, Defendant’s Exhibit A.) Manley received no further notices from his agent or Nationwide. On November 15, 1999, Manley’s Nationwide agent became disaffiliated with the company.</p>

Manley, upon contacting Nationwide regarding the accident, learned of the cancellation of his insurance policy. On January 19, 2000, Manley filed a request to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>and review of the cancellation. Nationwide challenged the appeal as untimely and lacking in merit since the policy cancellation was proper and in accordance with the dictates of Act 68.</p>

In support of its case, Nationwide introduced computer activity logs indicating that a November 10, 1999 warning letter was mailed to Manley advising him that failure to pay the premium within 15 days would result in termination of his automobile policy, effective November 25, 1999. It was further noted that the activity logs indicate no further payments were posted to Manley’s account.</p>
    <p id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.7",58,[1003,425,752,960]]]'>Manley testified that he paid his premium at the office of his insurance agent. He testified that on several occasions his mail was either not delivered or misdeliv-ered. He testified that because of the mail problem, he made arrangements with the phone company to pay his bills. His testimony is that after receiving the-note and check from his agent he expected to receive a billing notice from Nationwide. Manley did not make any further payments as he was awaiting the receipt of a bill. He testified that he received no notice and he did not learn of the cancellation of his auto insurance policy until he contacted Nationwide in late December 1999 or early January 2000. Upon learning of the cancellation, he promptly requested a review of the cancellation.</p>
    <p id="b58-8" data-blocks='[["BL_58.8",58,[1002,1417,755,1073]]]'>In sustaining the appeal, the Insurance Commissioner observed that Nationwide could not produce a copy of the warning/termination notice, a certificate of mailing, a template or an exemplar of the form used to generate the warning/termination notice, or testimony that the notice was never returned to the insurer. (Notes of Testimony, February 2, 2000, pp. 53-94; Exhibit N-l.) It was found that fewer than 15 days elapsed between Nationwide’s November 10, 1999 mail date and the November 25, 1999 cancellation date. Based thereon, the Insurance Department concluded that Nationwide’s warning/termination notice did not comply with the mandates of Act 68. The Commissioner affirmed, based in part on the credible testimony of Manley, and in part on its own interpretation of Act 68. Nationwide now appeals to this Court.</p>

    <p id="b59-8" data-blocks='[["BL_59.7",59,[958,407,756,445]]]'>Nationwide contends that Manley’s mere assertion that he was having trouble with his mail was insufficient as a matter of law to support the conclusion that Nationwide improperly cancelled the Manley automobile insurance policy. Additionally, it is argued that the evidence of record supports a finding that the policy was can-celled in accord with Act 68.</p>
    <p id="b59-9" data-blocks='[["BL_59.8",59,[958,885,756,548]]]'>Nationwide credits the testimony of Patrick Madigan, who explained that the computer printouts show the dates on which certain actions were taken and the type of notices sent, as being sufficient to support its burden, and Nationwide relies on <em>Done-gal </em>as support for this contention. However, in advancing this argument, Nationwide fails to address the shortcomings of the evidence it presented to the Insurance Commissioner.</p>
    <p id="b59-10" data-blocks='[["BL_59.9",59,[956,1467,756,1231]],["BL_60.1",60,[200,307,755,390]]]'>In <em>Donegal, </em>the insured offered credible testimony that the cancellation notices were mailed. Furthermore, Donegal produced certificates of making for cancellation notices sent to the insured, established that the insured’s name was listed among those issued a notice of cancellation, and produced evidence that there was no indication in Donegal’s file that any of the mailings had been returned to Done-gal. Based on that foundation, this Court held that the proofs of mailing, along with the insurer’s credible testimony regarding business practices, and the other documentation produced by the insurer showing the date of mailing are sufficient to establish that a notice of cancellation has been sent to the insured. <em>Donegal, </em><a href="/a2d/694/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="694 A.2d 391" data-case-ids="11976508" data-case-paths="/a2d/694/0391-01">694 A.2d at 394</a>. Unlike <em>Donegal, </em>here, the evidence does not support petitioner’s contention. Here, the only evidence presented was the testimony of Patrick Madigan and his interpretation of computer printouts. Consequently, the Insurance Commissioner concluded <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>that where an insurer fails to introduce as evidence a copy of the actual termination notice, an exemplar of a computer generated form, or detailed testimony about what was mailed on a particular date, the insurer does not establish a presumption that a termination notice was received by the insured.</p>
    <p id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[197,737,758,1524]]]'>Additionally, the Insurance Commissioner concluded that the hard mailing list produced by Nationwide lacks the same value as a U.S. Postal Service certificate of mailing to a particular address. She further noted that the lack of testimony indicating that the item was not returned by the postal service weakens a presumption that an item was received. (Commissioner’s Decision, p. 8.) Equally troubling for the Commissioner was Nationwide’s failure to produce a blank copy of the document that its records show was mailed on November 10, 1999. She observes that since Nationwide’s own records refer to this document as a warning notice, the testimony establishes only that a warning was sent to Manley, not a notice of cancellation. (Commissioner’s Decision, p. 8.) The Insurance Commissioner expressed concern that the lack of a copy of the notice sent essentially precludes review of the document and a determination as to whether the document strictly adheres to the requirements of Act 68. Accordingly, the Insurance Commissioner concluded that Nationwide failed to establish that the cancellation of the Manley automobile insurance policy was in strict accordance with Act 68. We agree.</p>

The Commissioner interpreted this language to mean that 15 days must intervene between the date of mailing and date of cancellation. That interpretation reflects the general concern of the legislature that insureds shall be given a reasonable time in which to cure their error or obtain new insurance. Accordingly, the Commissioner properly determined that 15 days must pass between the date of mailing and the date of cancellation and that the calculation of that period is done by excluding the first and last days from the count.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In so holding, the Commissioner has simply reaffirmed the principle that where a certain time period is required to intervene before the cancellation notice can take effect then the cancellation cannot become effective, until the expiration of the time period.</p>
