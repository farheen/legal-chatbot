In <em>Miranda, </em>the Court held that “the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.” <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. at 1612</a>. As “custodial interrogation” was defined as “questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way,” (<a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. at 1612</a>), a spontaneous statement volunteered by a defendant that is not in response to a police query would not fall within the strictures of Miranda, and would therefore be admissible.
