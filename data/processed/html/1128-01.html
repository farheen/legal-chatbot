We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b1187-16" data-blocks='[["BL_1187.14",1187,[190,2450,748,182]],["BL_1187.15",1187,[989,253,749,707]]]'>On February 22, 1989, Claimant sustained a work-related injury while employed by Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital (Employer). As a result of this injury, Claimant received benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation payable. Claimant subsequently executed a supplemental agreement, indicating that she returned to work on June 3, 1989 without a loss of earning power. On January 16, 1991, Claimant filed a petition for reinstatement of benefits. Prior to receiving a final adjudication of her reinstatement petition, Claimant died on March 23, 1993 from a cause unrelated to her work injury. Claimant died intestate and was survived by her husband, the petitioner in this matter, and Laurel Wingert (Wingert), her 22-year old daughter from a previous marriage.</p>
    <p id="b1187-20" data-blocks='[["BL_1187.17",1187,[987,987,750,698]]]'>One week after Claimant’s death, the WCJ issued a decision, dated March 31, 1993, which reinstated her benefits for the period December 15, 1989 through March 23, 1993. Employer appealed to the Board. During the pendency of the appeal, Employer filed a petition for supersedeas, which the Board denied. Accordingly, a cheek was issued to Claimant’s estate in the amount of $33,-945.31, representing the benefits due Claimant for the period December 15, 1989 through the date of her death. On August 1, 1994, the Board affirmed the WCJ’s decision granting Claimant’s petition for reinstatement of benefits.</p>
    <p id="b1187-21" data-blocks='[["BL_1187.18",1187,[985,1719,751,562]]]'>In the interim, White filed a petition to review the WCJ’s decision,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> requesting that the check in the amount of $33,945.31 be paid to him as Claimant’s only dependent, and not to Claimant’s estate. Employer filed a timely answer, denying the material allegations of White’s petition. Upon consideration of the evidence presented, the WCJ concluded that wage loss compensation due and owing to a successful claimant is payable to the claimant’s estate if the claimant dies before receiving the funds.</p>

Specifically, the.WCJ distinguished specific loss and death cases from the present matter on the basis that compensation in the former cases is not paid in a <a id="p1130" href="#p1130" data-label="1130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1130</a>single lump sum but is paid on a weekly basis to aid in the support of the dependents who are entitled to compensation under the Act. The WCJ further explained that payment of such a significant sum to White would serve to defeat the interests of taxing authorities and Claimant’s creditors. Therefore, the WCJ denied White’s petition for review. White appealed to the Board, and the Board affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b1188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1188.4",1188,[231,768,751,364]]]'>On appeal to this court, the sole issue presented is whether the WCJ erred in deeming Section 410 of the Act inapplicable and therefore holding that the wage loss compensation due and owing to Claimant who died prior to the final adjudication of her reinstatement petition should be paid to Claimant’s estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b1188-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1188.8",1188,[224,1683,753,512]]]'>It was the WCJ’s position that this section applies solely to specific loss and death cases because only two sections of the Act, <em>i.e., </em>Sections 306(g) and 307, 77 P.S. §§ 541 and 561, speak in terms of paying benefits to someone other than the claimant, and those sections deal with specific loss and fatal claims. White, on the other hand, asserts that Section 410’s scheme of distribution applies to all claims regardless of the nature of the loss. We agree.</p>

Upon reading the Act in general and Section 410 in particular, we find no support for the WCJ’s position. Section 410, by its very language, does not limit its application to a specific doss or fatal claim, and we cannot interpret it as such. The law is clear that we, as an appellate court, are without authority to insert language into a statutory provision where the legislature has failed to supply it. <em>Key Savings and Loan Assn. v.

White maintains that the evidence of record unequivocally establishes that he was Claimant’s only dependent at the time of her death, but our review of the record belies this assertion. At a hearing before the WCJ, White testified that he was living with Claimant at the time of her death and that they had never been separated. Notes of Testimony, April 7, 1994, at 12. White, however, did not offer any evidence that he was incapable of self-support or that he was otherwise dependent upon Claimant for support at the time of her death. We therefore conclude that White failed to establish that he was a dependent entitled to compensation under Section 410 of the Act.</p>

Notes of Testimony, June 14, 1994, at 9-10. She also testified that at that time, she was married and had not lived with her mother for a least one year. Id. at 11-12.
