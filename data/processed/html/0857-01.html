The court made no finding as to whether the application of the owner of the invention in fact dominated the invention of Burke, but merely that such was Burke’s contention and belief. The only purpose the court had in referring to the intervening application in that case and the belief of Burke that it covered his invention was to negative an intention upon his part to surrender all claim to the invention. So in the case at bar, if appellee’s application of 1922 was believed by him to cover his particular invention, and that <a id="p863" href="#p863" data-label="863" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*863</a>certain prior art used in combination with it was covered by a patent owned by his assignee, and appellee did not know that he would be entitled as well to a patent upon the combination, which he in fact had invented, this if true, like in the <em>McGrath case, </em>negatives any intention to conceal or suppress his invention.</p>

    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[146,601,1237,43]]]'>In <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Winsor, <a href="/us/62/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="21 How. 322" data-case-ids="683838" data-case-paths="/us/62/0322-01">supra,</a> </em>the court said, upon this subject:</p>
    <blockquote id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[102,671,1323,198]]]'>Tbe real interest of an inventor with respect to an assertion or surrender of his rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States, whether it be sought in his declarations or acts, or in forbearance or neglect to speak or act, is an inquiry or conclusion of <em>fact, </em>and peculiarly within the province of the jury, guided by legal evidence submitted to them at the trial.</blockquote>
    <p id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[101,894,1325,840]]]'>It is therefore pertinent to inquire as to what the tribunals of the Patent Office have held upon this question. All of them agreed that the appellant had failed to sustain his burden of proving such concealment or suppression. The examiner of interferences recites the 1922 application of appellee, together with other facts, and concludes that abandonment had not been established. The examiners in chief, in arriving at the same conclusion, hold that the <em>McGrath case </em>is applicable to the case at bar, and that appellee’s 1922 application negatives suppression and concealment of the invention by ap-pellee. The commissioner’s decision inferentially approves the views of the examiners in chief regarding the applicability of the <em>McGrath case </em>to the 1922 application of appellee, but specifically places his award of priority upon other grounds. In view of our conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the commissioner erred as to the specific ground upon which he awarded priority to appellee, for our decision does not rest upon unanimity of the Patent Office tribunals upon this question of fact.</p>
    <p id="b313-8" data-blocks='[["BL_313.8",313,[103,1740,1322,588]]]'>We are of the opinion that the <em>McGrath case </em>is applicable to the case at bar, rather than <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Hepburn, </em>and that appellee, as found by the examiners in chief, was not negligent in thinking that the claims of his 1922 application fully covered the invention for which he was entitled to patent, and that there was no intention upon his part or upon the part of his assignee to suppress or conceal his invention. The fact that he was entitled to a broader patent than he acquired, or than his specifications disclosed, has no'bearing necessarily upon the question of suppression or concealment. That would be material if there was proof that he omitted some part, of his invention from his disclosure for the purpose of concealing his entire invention, but there is no such evidence in this case.</p>
    <p id="b313-9" data-blocks='[["BL_313.9",313,[104,2337,1321,93]],["BL_314.1",314,[244,237,1319,693]]]'>There is another established fact that very strongly corroborates the conclusion that there was no suppression or concealment of ap-<a id="p864" href="#p864" data-label="864" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*864</a>pellee’s invention. In July, 1924, appellee’s assignee, the Atlas Co., freely gave to appellant’s assignee, the Lamson Co., a sample of appellee’s device. Not only was the Lamson Co. a strong competitor of the Atlas Co., but they were in litigation with each other over the question of infringement of patents. It is hardly conceivable that this sample would have been furnished the Lamson Co. without immediate application for a patent, had not the officers of the Atlas Co. as well as appellee believed that appellee’s 1922, application, together with prior patents owned by the Atlas Co., gave them full protection. Furthermore, it may be observed that when such sample device was given to the Lamson Co., neither appellee nor the Atlas Co., so far as the record discloses, knew anything about appellant or his invention, or of it being placed in commercial use in January, 1924, or at any other time.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[242,937,1321,294]]]'>The appellant having failed to prove suppression or concealment of appellee’s invention at the time that appellant conceived, reduced to practice, and placed his invention in commercial use, or at any other time, and appellee being the first to conceive and reduce to practice the invention, priority must be awarded to him. The decision of the commissioner is <em>affirmed.</em>
