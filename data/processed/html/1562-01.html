Chapter 2089, Acts of 1877, amended certain sections of Chapter 1981, Acts 1874, including sections 6 and 8, and again fixed in detail the fees of Clerks cf the Circuit Court and of Justices of the Peace.

The Revised Statutes of 1892, the General Statutes of 1906, and the Revised General Statutes of 1920 each constitutes one enactment. Section 3084, Rev. Gen. Stats.,' defines the fees of the Clerks of the Circuit Courts. Section 5971, Rev. Gen. Stats., 1920, makes the fees of the Clerks of the Criminál Courts of Record “the same as the fees of the Clerks of the Circuit Courts in like cases.” Section 3312, Rev. Gen.

The intent of Chapter 11893, as shown by its title and contents, is to revise the fees of the Clerks of the Courts mentioned, as such fees are defined in sections 3084, 3312 and 5971, Rev. Gen. Stats., but not to change section 3384, making the fees of Justices of the Peace the same as those of the Clerks of the Circuit Courts as defined in section 3084, Rev. Gen. Stats., the provisions of Section 3084 as to fees being by reference made a part of Section 3384, Rev. Gen. Stats. Chapter 11893 shows this intent by including therein the Clerks “of the various courts of record” with Clerks of the Circuit Courts and not including Justices of the Peace. A provision with reference to the fees of Justices of the Peace if contained in Chapter 11893 would be inoperative under the title of the act. Sections 3084, 3312 and 5971, Rev. Gen. Stats^ were superseded by Chapter 11839, as to the fees of Clerks of the mentioned courts, but in so far as the provisions of section 3084, Rev. Gen. Stats., had been by reference made a part of section 3384, Rev. Gen. Stats., for the purpose of fixing the fees of Justices of the Peace, section 3084 remains a part of section 3384. This view is “consistent with the purpose of the adopting act,” Section 3384, Rev. Gen. Stats., and with the title, contents and purpose of Chapter 11893, Acts 1927.</p>
