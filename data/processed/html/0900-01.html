Prior to February 2004, police officers were required to inform an individual that there was no right to speak to counsel or anyone else before deciding whether to submit to chemical testing. <em>O’Connell </em>Police officers were further required to inform an individual that refusal to submit to chemical testing would result in the suspension of operating privileges. <em>See </em>Former 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(b)(2). Effective February 2004, the General Assembly amended the Implied Consent Law and added Chapter 38 to the Vehicle Code, which replaced former 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731. Chapter 38, Driving After Imbibing Alcohol or Utilizing Drugs, sets forth, among other things, the offense of DUI and the resulting penalties for a DUI conviction.</p>

Section 1547(b) of the Implied Consent Law further requires a police officer to inform an individual that operating privileges will be suspended if chemical testing is refused and, that, if convicted of DUI, the enhanced penalties of the DUI provisions apply. Unlike former Section 3731, the new DUI provisions identify the penalties to be imposed where an individual is convicted of DUI after refusing chemical testing. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3804(c).</p>
