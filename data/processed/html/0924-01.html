At this time, Ms. Isaac was in the eighth month of her fourth pregnancy. At that initial appointment in Dr. Bassaly’s office, Dr. Bassaly determined that Ms. Isaac’s due date was November 12, 1997. Also, at that initial office visit on October 21, 1997, Ms. Isaac executed an “Authorization for Surgery or Special Procedures” for a bilateral partial salpingectomy (the tubal litigation procedure to permanently prevent pregnancy) and a “[Sterilization Consent Form.”</blockquote>
