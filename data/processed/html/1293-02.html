On his present appeal defendant raises three principal issues for our consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> First, he contends for the first time on appeal that the presiding justice failed to follow the procedure required by M.R.Crim.P. 24(d) for selecting the alternate juror. We agree with this contention but hold that the error did not constitute the kind of “obvious error” that would warrant vacating the conviction. Second, defendant argues that the justice improperly imposed a greater sentence because of the fact that defendant, a male, had been found guilty by the jury of striking a woman. We agree that the justice used an improper sentencing criterion that warrants vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing by a different justice. We, however, affirm defendant’s conviction because we reject his third contention, namely, that the presiding justice demonstrated bias against him during the trial.</p>

The partnership never materialized, but instead Ms. Stocks opened the business by herself, precipitating a civil suit against her by Houston. He dropped that suit on July 17, 1986.</p>

There a verbal argument broke out between them. When Ms. Stocks turned to leave, Houston struck her in the face with a full swing of his hand, knocking her ten feet across the room and to the floor. Houston was charged with the Class D crime of assault and a jury convicted him. The presiding justice imposed a jail term of six months with all but ten days suspended, a fine of $500, and one year probation. Defendant’s appeal followed.</p>

Having decided to call one alternate juror in addition to the regular 12-member panel, the justice ordered that a list of 23 names be drawn from the venire remaining after the attorneys’ challenges for cause had been ruled upon. After each of the attorneys had exercised his four peremptory challenges against that list, leaving 15 potential jurors, the justice stated, “I’m not necessarily going to pick the alternate from the last three [names remaining on the list], so you can exercise your alternate challenge now.” By their peremptory challenges the attorneys then in fact removed the last two persons drawn from the venire, leaving 13 potential jurors. At that point, rather than designating as the alternate the last person still remaining on the list, the justice explained that he would “pick the alternate at the end of the case.” Once the 13 persons were impaneled, both counsel stated to the judge that the jury as seated was satisfactory. When the trial concluded, the justice then named as the alternate and discharged an individual other than the last person drawn from the list who had survived peremptory challenge. Neither counsel made any objection to that selection.</p>
    <p id="b1355-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1355.8",1355,[954,225,754,1363]]]'>The justice’s procedure for selecting the alternate juror is at odds with that required by M.R.Crim.P. 24(d). Rule 24(d) provides that the presiding justice “may direct that not more than four jurors <em>in addition to </em>the regular panel be called and <em>impaneled to sit as alternate jurors </em>as provided by law.” M.R.Crim.P. 24(d) (emphasis added). Rule 24 does not grant a judge the discretion to designate who will sit as the alternate juror. Instead the rule contemplates that the alternate juror must be selected by a random process that cannot be skewed by the exercise of discretion by the presiding justice. The random selection procedure of Rule 24 implicitly requires that the alternate juror be identified as such before the trial begins, and not at its conclusion as happened here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Further, if the judge decides to seat more than one alternate with the regular panel, the Rule 24 procedure for selection of the individuals who as alternates will actually participate in jury deliberations meets the statutory requirement that alternates are to replace any discharged regular jurors “in the order in which [the alternates] are called” from the venire. <em>See </em>15 M.R.S.A. § 1258 (1980).</p>

Rather than objecting to the presiding justice’s picking the alternate by a nonrandom method, defense counsel, informed before trial how the alternate would be picked, stated that he found the 13-mem-<a id="p1296" href="#p1296" data-label="1296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1296</a>ber panel satisfactory, and at the end of the trial made no objection to the justice’s choice of the alternate. In these circumstances, we on appeal review that procedure only for “obvious error.” <em>See </em>M.R. Crim.P. 52(b). Under that test the jury selection procedure must be not only plainly wrong but also “highly prejudicial before [it] will give rise to a reversal.” <em>State v.

The Superior Court justice stated, both in discussions with counsel during trial and later when determining defendant’s six-month jail term with all but ten days suspended, that he looks unfavorably upon men convicted of assaulting women. At the sentencing hearing the justice stated, “I generally give a short jail sentence <em>when men are convicted </em>of beating women or hitting women because I take a very dim view of men hitting women....” (Emphasis added) Although in setting the ten days of actual jail time he relied also on defendant’s lack of remorse and the unprovoked nature of his conduct, the sentencing justice ordered “two to three days” of jail time so that Houston would know that he “can’t go around hitting women.” That imposition by the sentencing court of what in effect was a two-day minimum jail term because defendant is male and the assault victim female constitutes an improper gender classification<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and requires us to vacate the sentence.</p>

Defense counsel based his contention in principal part on the justice’s articulation in chambers of his personal sentencing standard for men convicted of unprovoked assault upon women. Even though the justice acknowledged that he had revealed his sentencing practice, he denied the motion for a mistrial, pointing out that the man-hitting-woman factor was only relevant to his sentencing in the event defendant was convicted by the jury, that the jury and not he was the factfinder on guilt or innocence, and that during trial “I certainly keep an open mind, and I expect everybody else to.” Although the gender classification made by the justice’s sentencing practice is plainly improper, as we have declared above, his articulation of it to counsel in chambers does not by itself demonstrate a bias on the part of the justice against this particular defendant in the ongoing jury trial. On his motion for a mistrial, defense counsel also contended that the justice had revealed his bias by other statements that the justice allegedly had made in chambers “concerning Mr. Houston’s appearance ... [and] saying that he’s digging himself deeper and deeper.” We assume for present purposes that the justice did make those statements in chambers, but we know practically nothing from the record about either the context or the manner in which they were spoken.
