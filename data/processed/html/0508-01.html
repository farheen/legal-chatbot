Higgins executed a mortgage agreement and a note promising to pay Wacho-via Mortgage Corporation $250,000 in monthly payments over thirty years with a fixed annual interest rate of six percent. The mortgage was ultimately assigned to Chase Home Finance LLC. Chase also asserts that it holds the promissory note.</p>

Upon the Higginses’ request, the matter was removed to the Superior Court, and Chase answered the counterclaims.</p>

Regarding the amount owed, the Higginses asserted that they had not been credited fully for at least nine payments.
