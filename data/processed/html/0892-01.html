The sole testifying witness was Lansdale Borough Police Officer Thomas Pfund, who testified as follows: Officer Pfund was on patrol on February 11, 2005. N.T. 7/20/05 at 5. At approximately 7:00 p.m., Officer Pfund was traveling behind a Dodge pick-up truck when he decided to run the pick-up truck’s license plate number. N.T. 7/20/05 at 5. The Officer discovered the license plate number was marked as a “dead tag,” indicating that the license plate should not have been affixed to any vehicle. N.T. 7/20/05 at 5-6. Since the pick-up truck was not displaying a proper license plate, Officer Pfund activated his cruiser’s lights, thereby signaling the driver of the pick-up truck to pull to the curb. N.T. 7/20/05 at 6-7. The driver, who was later identified as being Appellant, stopped the pick-up truck in the road, just past a stop sign at the intersection of Sixth and Kenilworth Streets in Lansdale. N.T. 7/20/05 at 7-8. Officer Pfund testified that the pick-up truck obstructed the traffic flowing on Kenilworth and Sixth Streets. N.T. 7/20/05 at 7. In fact, Officer Pfund testified that Sixth Street traffic was blocked. N.T. 7/20/05 at 7-8.</p>

      <a id="p894" href="#p894" data-label="894" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*894</a>¶ 3 Officer Pfund approached Appellant, who was the only person in the pick-up truck. N.T. 7/20/05 at 8. Officer Pfund asked to see Appellant’s driver’s license, registration, and insurance. N.T. 7/20/05 at 8. Appellant informed Officer Pfund that the pick-up truck was neither registered nor insured and Appellant did not have a valid driver’s license. N.T. 7/20/05 at 9. Officer Pfund verified with PennDot that Appellant’s driver’s license had been suspended. N.T. 7/20/05 at 9. Officer Pfund told Appellant that he would not be permitted to drive the pick-up truck from the scene and that, per the police department’s policy, the pick-up truck was going to be towed and impounded since it was blocking traffic and no one else was available to drive the pick-up truck from the scene. N.T. 7/20/05 at 9. Officer Pfund testified that, since the pick-up truck was not insured, he would not permit Appellant or himself to move the pick-up truck out of the road. N.T. 7/20/05 at 11. Officer Pfund informed Appellant that he was going to conduct an inventory search in order to ensure that all of Appellant’s valuables were recorded prior to the pick-up truck being towed. N.T. 7/20/05 at 10. Officer Pfund then informed Appellant that he was free to go and he would be receiving a summons in the mail regarding the numerous traffic violations. N.T. 7/20/05 at 12. Appellant asked whether he could retrieve a pair of boots, which he used for work, from the pick-up truck, and Officer Pfund replied affirmatively. N.T. 7/20/05 at 11. Appellant took a pair of boots and a twelve pack of beer from the pick-up truck and walked away from the scene. N.T. 7/20/05 at 12.</p>

N.T. 7/20/05 at 13. In plain view in the front passenger area, Officer Pfund saw another pair of boots. N.T. 7/20/05 at 14, 29. As he was reaching for the boots, Officer Pfund noticed that a plastic bag was sticking out of the top of one of the boots. N.T. 7/20/05 at 14. Concluding it was unusual for a person to have a plastic bag inside of a boot, and believing the plastic bag contained something valuable or illegal, Officer Pfund took the plastic bag out of the boot and found therein several prepackaged bags of cocaine, a large bag of loose cocaine, and packing material. N.T. 7/20/05 at 14. Officer Pfund radioed a fellow officer, told him what he had discovered in the pick-up truck, and asked the officer to find Appellant and arrest him. N.T. 7/20/05 at 15. Officer Pfund testified that, at this point, he decided to seize the pick-up truck as a forfeiture due to the large amount of cocaine he had discovered. N.T. 7/20/05 at 15.</p>

N.T. 7/20/05 at 16. Officer Pfund indicated he was on duty conducting random checks of license plate numbers when he pulled out of the parking lot behind Appellant’s pick-up truck and typed the license plate number into the computer as he was driving. N.T. 7/20/05 at 16-17. Officer Pfund admitted that the area was known to be a “high drug area” and that he had seen the pick-up truck parked in the vicinity previously. N.T. 7/20/05 at 17. Officer Pfund indicated that, after he stopped the pick-up truck, Appellant provided him with a proper title, confirming that Appellant owned the pick-up truck. N.T. 7/20/05 at 19. Officer Pfund reiterated that, after Appellant stopped the pickup truck, one lane of traffic was completely blocked. N.T. 7/20/05 at 21. Officer Pfund testified that, once he discovered the pick-up truck was neither insured nor <a id="p895" href="#p895" data-label="895" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*895</a>registered, he decided to impound and tow the vehicle pursuant to the department’s General Order D88.8. N.T. 7/20/05 at 21. Officer Pfund indicated that he did not give Appellant the option of driving the vehicle himself or having it privately towed. N.T. 7/20/05 at 22. Officer Pfund testified that, whether the police were going to tow the vehicle or whether Appellant arranged to have the vehicle towed privately, Officer Pfund would have conducted an inventory search for personal belongings in order to protect the integrity of the police. N.T. 7/20/05 at 31-32. Officer Pfund testified that his department conducts inventory searches in order to ensure that false claims regarding the loss of valuable are not made against the police. N.T. 7/20/05 at 31-32.</p>

Appellant was convicted of the offenses indicated <em>supra, </em>and he was sentenced to an aggregate of three to six years in prison. This timely appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On May 26, 2006, the trial court ordered Appellant to file a Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement, Appellant filed the requested statement on June 8, 2006, and the trial court filed a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion.</p>

Specifically, Appellant’s sole contention is that the inventory search was illegal since “Officer Pfund failed and/or refused to ask [Appellant] if [Appellant] could make arrangements to have the pickup truck towed, hauled, or otherwise transported from the scene to a location where it would not constitute a hazard to the safety of other motorists thus obviating the necessity to conduct an inventory search.” Appellant’s Brief at 9-10.</p>
