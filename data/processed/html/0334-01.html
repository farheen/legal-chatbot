Tucker mailed to appellant insurance company an application for $1,000.00 life insurance, designating appellee, his wife, as beneficiary thereunder. The application was accompanied by a payment of $1.00 for “one month Introductory Term Insurance.” The company received the application on May 12, 1965, and promptly initiated an investigation to determine whether Mr. Tucker was an acceptable insurance risk. In response thereto, it received' from Mr. Tucker’s physician, on May 19, 1965, a report, dated May 17, 1965, stating he had last treated Mr. Tucker on May 4, 1965, for “functional pylorospasm” and indicating his patient’s health as “good.” A Retail Credit Company report, dated May 19, 1965, received by appellant May 24, 1965, advised that Mr. Tucker had died the previous evening of an apparent heart attack. The company thereafter declined Mr. Tucker’s application and returned the $1.00 payment.</p>

The trial court denied the motion of the insurance company and granted summary judgment for $1,000.00 in favor of appellee. This appeal followed. The primary error claimed is the holding of the trial court, as a matter of law, that a contract of insurance was in full force and effect at the time of the death of James E. Tucker.</p>

    <p id="b376-7" data-blocks='[["BL_376.7",376,[203,1013,752,1041]]]'>Appellant’s position is that the application before us for interpretation is strictly an <em>application </em>for insurance and did not, upon its execution by Mr. Tucker and receipt by the company, create a policy of insurance. It argues that, by the very terms of the application, no insurance was to become effective until the application was approved and the policy issued during the life and good health of the applicant. If the application was approved and the policy issued, the policy would be in force as term insurance for the first month at a premium of $1.00, during which time the insured could examine it, with the option of rejecting it within that period. If the insured accepted the policy, it would thereafter continue on the “whole life <em>plan”</em>

She contends that the language of the application is misleading to the “man in the street,” implying that upon execution of the application and remittance of $1.00 to the company, the applicant receives $1,000.00 term insurance for an introductory period of 30 days. During this time the company would presumably investigate the applicant as an insurance risk and, if he were approved, issue a policy of insurance. The prospective insured would then have the opportunity to examine the policy and decide whether to retain it. Appellee argues that because of the ambiguity in the application, it must be construed against appellant; that a finding is compelled that at the time of her husband’s death, he was insured for $1,000.00.</p>
    <p id="b376-11" data-blocks='[["BL_376.12",376,[1009,1360,749,866]]]'>We find no duplicity in the application that could mislead the ordinary layman. While ambiguities in documents drawn by insurance companies are to be construed against their interests and in favor of those insured, this legal principle has no application where no ambiguity exists.

We are of the opinion that absent obvious ambiguity in the terms of the application, the mere execution and mailing by decedent of the application together with the payment of $1.00 did not create a contract of insurance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
