Dr. Busis stated that he, too, performed audiometric testing that revealed bilateral hearing loss, but Claimant only suffered a 23.5% binaural hearing loss as measured by the AMA Guides. Dr. Busis stated, however, that in his opinion, only 15.31% of that loss could be attributed to Claimant’s exposure to occupational noise, with the remaining 8.11% of his hearing loss due to the aging process. Dr. Busis explained that the 8.11% he calculated that resulted from the normal aging was determined from International Standard 1999 of The International Organization of Standardization (ISO 1999) which sets forth a predetermined hearing loss that occurs solely as a result of aging. He also stated that the portion of Claimant’s hearing loss resulting from exposure to occupational noise occurred entirely within his first ten to fifteen years of employment at the Aliquippa plant, and beyond that, any hearing loss was attributable to heredity and aging.</p>

Katz testified that when Claimant began working at the Aliquip-pa plant in 1957, it was owned by J &amp; L Steel (J &amp; L). In 1974, however, LTV Corporation, a Dallas-based holding company, purchased 100% of J &amp; L’s stock at which time J &amp; L ceased to exist as an independent steel producer and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of LTV Corporation. In the merger, LTV Corporation took on all of J &amp; L’s assets and liabilities, assumed liability for all of J &amp; L’s existing workers’ compensation claims, and became responsible for paying all workers’ compensation claims that arose before 1974. The Aliquippa plant, however, continued to operate under the J &amp; L name. In 1981, LTV Corporation merged J <em>&amp; </em>L with Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Steel Company which it had acquired in 1978.

In both <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Baughman, </em>the main issue in each case was whether the corporation surviving a merger was responsible for paying a share of the claimant’s benefits after he became disabled from silicosis. Section 308(a) of the Occupational Disease Act, Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 566, <em>as amended, </em>77 P.S. § 1408(a), provides that when benefits are awarded because of disability caused by one or more of the enumerated occupational diseases, compensation shall be paid jointly by the employer and the Commonwealth; with the employer responsible for 60% and the Commonwealth responsible for 40%. However, where there has been a showing that the claimant worked for successive different employers, Section 301(g) of the Occupational Disease Act, 77 P.S. § 1401(g),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> provides that the Commonwealth shall be responsible for 100% of the compensation unless it can conclusively prove that the claimant was disabled as a result of the last exposure. We decided in both of those eases that a merger or acquisition created a new employer for purposes of Section 301(g) of the Occupational Disease Act, and that as a matter of law, the employers in those cases were not responsible for contribution.</p>

In this ease, the issue is whether a claimant would be deprived of compensation for an admitted work-related hearing loss merely because most of the injury occurred early in his career at the plant where he worked and that plant changed ownership. Because there are different policy considerations and a different Act, those cases are not controlling in determining who is a “new” employer when interpreting 306(c)(8)(vi) of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[183,1454,756,994]],["BL_218.6",218,[994,235,747,228]]]'>Under Employer’s position, in determining who is an employer under 306(c)(8)(vi) of the Act, we must look at the change in corporate ownership, which entity controls, and the different minute books, and ultimately conclude that there is a different employer. However, the intent behind the adoption of Section 306(c)(8)(vi) of the Act was not, as Employer’s position suggests, that corporations could merely change their structure and “churn” their employees to absolve themselves of liability, but to impose on employers the responsibility to pay only for the hearing loss a claimant incurred while in its employ. Just because a claimant works at the same job for many years does not necessarily mean that he has the same employer no matter if the plant or corporation he works at is acquired or merged. To determine if the new corporate title owner is absolved of responsibility because it is a new employer depends on the totality of the circumstances on how the plant or corporation is‘ acquired; if the circumstances establish that the new owner is a successor-in-interest, it is not a new employer.</p>
    <p id="b218-8" data-blocks='[["BL_218.9",218,[990,520,752,851]]]'>In this case, the WCJ found that Employer was a successor-in-interest because when LTV acquired J &amp; L, it was a stock sale rather than an asset sale; it assumed all operations at the Aliquippa plant and retained all of J &amp; L employees; it specifically agreed to assume liability for all of J &amp; L’s workers’ compensation claims existing at the time of the merger; and it paid all workers’ compensation claims that arose prior to 1974 when LTV acquired J &amp; L. In other words, it assumed responsibility for all claims of J &amp; L employees at the time of the merger, including Claimant. These facts provide substantial evidence upon which the WCJ could find that LTV was a successor and not a new employer, and responsible for all of Claimant’s hearing loss.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

    <p id="b218-9" data-blocks='[["BL_218.10",218,[984,1428,755,897]]]'>Employer’s final argument is that the failure of the WCJ to determine a specific date of injury requires a reversal or, at the very least, a remand so that a date may be determined. Section 306(c)(8)(ix), 77 P.S. § 513(8)(ix), however, specifically provides that, “the date of injury for occupational hearing loss ... is the earlier of the date on which the claim is filed or the last date of long-term exposure to hazardous occupational noise while in the employ of the employer against whom the claim is filed.” Because Claimant was still working for Employer on the date he filed his claim petition for hearing loss benefits, the date of injury can only be the date that the claim was filed, which was August 21, 1995.
