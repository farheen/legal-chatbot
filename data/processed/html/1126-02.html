We agree that, although a portion of this argument was supported by evidence before the jury, the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of proper argument in asserting that “these people,” the government’s witnesses collectively, were scared of appellants and yet had “sacrificed” to come to court and accuse them— a sacrifice, he implied, the jury should vindicate. We nevertheless hold, for reasons to be stated, that this impropriety was not of sufficient gravity when weighed against the strength of the government’s evidence to require reversal of appellants’ convictions.

Dray was not there, so King decided to wait for him. He saw appellants Murray, Stokes, and others in the apartment. King waited there for forty-five minutes but his friend did not show up. He saw a 9 mm Taurus pistol lying on the floor, and observing that the others had fallen asleep or were engrossed in a television show, he picked up the gun and left the apartment unnoticed.</p>

She-linda Bryant too was -with Stokes, Thomas, Murray, and “a little boy” at the Oak Park apartment. She had known Stokes for some five months, and Thomas and Murray for years. According to Bryant, Thomas and Murray were sitting around and talking, but Stokes was only “hanging [in the apartment] for a minute. He didn’t stay.” King also left soon after she arrived.</p>

King showed the Taurus pistol to Spires, then went with his friends to trade the gun to someone named “Tony” for $100 and a smaller, 9 mm Glock handgun. While in the shopping center on Wheeler Road, King gave Spires the Glock for safekeeping because he was afraid the owner of the Taurus gun “was going to ride up on [him] sooner or later.”</p>

He looked under the chair and asked Bryant if anyone had been by the couch while he slept. Not finding the gun, Thomas and Murray left the apartment and climbed into a Bronco truck that belonged to Thomas’s wife. Although Stokes had not been in the apartment when Thomas woke up, Bryant saw him come down the street as the others were leaving and join them as the driver of the Bronco. Diggs heard Murray remark before leaving that “he hoped the little boy had not taken [Thomas’s] gun.”</p>

Stokes, Murray, Thomas, and two other men jumped out of the vehicle, and Thomas accused King of stealing the gun. All three appellants demanded to know why King had taken the gun, warning him that “[y]ou fucked up man.” Murray punched King in the face, whereupon King begged Spires to hand over the Glock 9 mm gun to Thomas, and Spires complied. According to King, appellants now had at least three guns in their possession, the Glock, another 9 mm gun, and a third handgun. Not satisfied with receiving the Glock, appellants forced King into the back of the Bronco where the beating continued. Murray, according to King, “just kept punching me in the face” while threatening to kill him (Murray at one point pulled out a gun), and Thomas added, “[n]o, we’re going to take him to the fat man” first, a threat King viewed ominously. Stokes climbed back into the driver’s seat and drove the Bronco out of the parking lot and down Barnaby Street to Brandywine Street, as the punching continued in the backseat.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Some of the men “posted themselves around the vehicle and on the sidewalk.” As “this young man was walking across the walkway,” one of the men grabbed him by the neck with his left arm and “pressed up against his body.” That man had a “dark object,” and Parks “could see from the way his hand was formed that it wasn’t his fist ... [his hand] was molded around something.” The man holding the boy — who “seemed ... real scared, real frightened” — squeezed him harder and said “we[’ve] been looking for you.” At the same time, the four other men from the vehicle were “scanning” the surroundings, acting as look-outs. Two of the men searched the boy’s pockets before the man who held him by the neck pushed him into the Bronco. All five men then climbed back into the car, surrounding the boy. Parks watched through the open rear window as someone struck the boy with a closed fist and “the boy’s head just, kept jerking and jerking.” (Photographs depicting King’s bruised and bloodied face on the day of the assault were shown to the jury.) The vehicle backed up, turned around, and drove off.</p>

He dialed 911 and reported the kidnapping, describing the Bronco and its tag number. Less than a minute later police officers responded to the call, pulled up behind the Bronco on Brandywine Street, and ordered the occupants to exit the vehicle. Before Murray jumped out, King saw him throw a handgun under the driver’s seat; he then tried to flee but was caught by the police and arrested. Stokes was also arrested on the scene, while Thomas was able to run away; he was arrested later. Frisking Stokes, an officer found a .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol tucked in his right pocket; though it was unloaded, the hammer was cocked. Stokes’s fingerprint matched one later found on the ammunition magazine in a loaded semi-automatic pistol seized from under the driver’s seat of the Bronco. King had seen one of the assailants flee with the Glock 9 mm.</p>

There was a material witness warrant out for a couple of these people.”) In turn, counsel for Murray asserted in his closing that “by their own admission [Diggs and Bryant were] reluctant witnesses, they didn’t want to testify,” and suggested that the reason why “they were reluctant to come down” was that “they were pressured by the detectives” (who had been “duped by Mr. King”) to falsely incriminate appellants.

People that lose a day’s schooling by coming down to the courthouse. People that waste them time by having to come down to the U.S. Attorney’s office, and the police department and the grand jury and trial.

The government points out that, far from being a troubled youth who had been victimized in this case, the defense had portrayed King as a “liar, [a] gang-mongering, gun-toting 15-year-old” (this the opening statement of Murray’s counsel) who had “every reason to come in here and make stuff up” and “kept changing his story” (the opening statement of Stokes’s counsel) beginning with his first account to the police.

King testified that, besides shoving him into the Bronco and pummeling him, appellants told him that they were “going to take him to the fat man,” something he feared meant worse violence. Later, when King met appellant Thomas on the street (before the latter was arrested), Thomas warned him not to talk to the police, a threat that again made King afraid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> That a fifteen-year-old, later called on to accuse in open court those who had beaten and threatened him, would continue to feel intimidated is certainly a plausible inference. Accordingly, the objection to the prosecutor’s remarks about King’s fear cannot be that they lacked evidentiary support, or that they had no relevance at all as an explanation for his changing recollection and unwillingness to testify.

In this regard, too, the case differs from others in which we have reversed. In <em>Mercer, </em>for example, the prosecutor elicited testimony from a witness “impl[ying that she] had received some type of threat regarding her testimony,” and specifically tried through questioning “to link [certain] people in the back of the courtroom to the defendants, creat[ing] an impression that the spectators were there to influence the testimony of the witnesses.” <a href="/a2d/724/1176-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="724 A.2d 1176" data-case-ids="11641992" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/1176-01">724 A.2d at 1186, 1187</a>. In <em>Ebron, </em>similarly, the prosecutor used questioning of a witness to “attribute to one defendant] the threatening actions of ... [courtroom] spectators based solely on their association with him in the neighborhood.” <a href="/a2d/838/1140-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="838 A.2d 1140" data-case-ids="9301365" data-case-paths="/a2d/838/1140-01">838 A.2d at 1149</a>. <em>See also Foreman v.

In this case, by contrast, the prosecutor’s references to witness fear were based on something the jury might naturally have understood anyway: that witnesses to a violent crime subpoenaed to testify in court may continue to exhibit fear of those they believe were the perpetrators. <em>See McClellan, </em><a href="/a2d/706/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="706 A.2d 542" data-case-ids="11861330" data-case-paths="/a2d/706/0542-01">706 A.2d at 551</a> (“It is not unnatural ... for any witness to react self-protectively out of generalized fear for her own safety after witnessing a murder, even though the witness may not have received a direct threat.”). Athough any suggestion that a witness fears retaliation for testifying may invite unfair speculation by the jury, the danger is compounded when a prosecutor, without evidentiary basis, alludes to conduct by the defendant(s) as-sertedly meant to intimidate him or her <em>as </em>a witness.

As a practical matter, there was no issue at trial of whether King had been abducted by persons who had a score to settle with him. Saintclair Parks, an entirely disinterested bystander, saw five men accost King saying “we[’ve] been looking for you,” search him and shove him into the Bronco, and drive away while surrounding him and beating him. Parks was barely cross-examined, except to confirm that he <a id="p1136" href="#p1136" data-label="1136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1136</a>could not identify the assailants. So the issue was whether appellants were among the five abductors. King’s testimony that they were — that appellants beat and kidnapped him because he had stolen Thomas’s Taurus gun — was firmly corroborated. Stokes and Murray were arrested on the scene barely a minute after Parks called 911 to report the abduction. Seeing the police approach, Murray jumped out of the vehicle (after throwing down a firearm, according to King) and tried to flee but was apprehended nearby. Stokes’s fingerprints were on an ammunition cartridge retrieved from the gun found under the driver’s seat, and a second gun (unloaded but cocked) was in his pocket.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Myles Spires identified Thomas from a photograph as the man who had taken the 9 mm Glock from him (King saw one of the assailants — he did not say which — flee the police carrying the Glock.) And Samura Diggs and Shelinda Bryant identified all three appellants, whom they knew well, as part of the group who had left the Oak Park Apartments in Thomas’s wife’s Bronco after (in the case of Thomas and Murray) Thomas discovered that his gun had been taken — and after Murray declared that “he hoped the little boy [King] had not taken [the gun].” Stokes, according to Bryant, rejoined the others on the street and was the driver of the Bronco, thus confirming King’s testimony that Stokes drove the vehicle before and during the abduction.</p>

But the added impropriety does not change our conclusion that reversal is unwarranted. The trial judge repeatedly told the jury that the government had the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And regardless of the prosecutor’s argument or his own story, Stokes faced the problem of countering proof that he was arrested on the scene and that his fingerprints were on the ammunition cartridge found inside the Bronco. <em>See, e.g., Porter v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/826/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="826 A.2d 398" data-case-ids="9110411" data-case-paths="/a2d/826/0398-01">826 A.2d 398</a>, 406-09 (D.C.2003).</p>

Thomas’s additional claim that the judge erroneously submitted a charge of carrying a pistol without a license to the jury although he was not indicted for that charge entitles him to no relief, because — as he concedes — the judge later realized the error and did not enter judgment against him on that charge. Murray’s further claim that he was erroneously denied an admitted perjurer's instruction as to Charles King fails in light of decisions such as <em>Skyers </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/a2d/619/0931-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="619 A.2d 931" data-case-ids="7363529" data-case-paths="/a2d/619/0931-01">619 A.2d 931</a>, 932 n. 3 (D.C.1993), and <em>Mitchell v.

Finally, Thomas had no right to be present when the trial judge, twelve days after signing the judgment and commitment order, issued an amended order adding the statutorily required terms of supervised release. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 24— 403.01(b)(2)(A) (2001); Super.
