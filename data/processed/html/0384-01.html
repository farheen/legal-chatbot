    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[199,457,754,476]]]'>¶ 6 The issue becomes more problematic under other factual scenarios. In <em>Owens, </em>this court decided that a governmental agency, such as the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI), did not qualify as a proper governmental authority under section 1702 because it is not ordinarily involved in the reporting or investigating of motor vehicle accidents. The <em>Owens </em>court determined that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[234,955,717,986]]]'>The DOLI is not a part of the government’s emergency response team, is not present at the scene of the accident, does not observe, first-hand, the alleged injuries, and does not make a contemporaneous report of the circumstances of both the accident and the injury. Instead, DOLI receives a simple notification, through an individual’s employer, that an employee has been injured during the course and scope of employment. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 994 (relating to an employer’s report to the Department of Labor and Industry for Worker’s Compensation purposes). This non-eontemporaneous, second-hand notification simply does not act to prevent fraud in the reporting of unidentified motor vehicle accidents as effectively as a report to the police.</blockquote>

Because Blazquez did not have an EMT fill out his accident report, the notification could not have prevented fraud; therefore, the reporting requirement of section 1702 has not been met. <em>Owens, supra. </em>Blazquez did not report his accident to someone at the scene of the accident, but instead filed it directly with PennDOT. The trial court correctly determined that “reporting an accident to a statewide agency such as PennDOT will [not] play any meaningful role in eliminating the threat of fraud unless PennDOT promptly relays any reports filed with it to local police and law enforcement authorities.” To find otherwise is to circumvent the legislative intent behind the reporting requirement of section 1702.</p>
    <p id="b438-9" data-blocks='[["BL_438.9",438,[996,628,755,1028]]]'>¶ 8 Here, Blazquez offered no corroborative evidence validating his claim was presented. Blazquez waited nearly one month before he reported the incident to PennDOT. Had the accident been timely reported to the police, it could have been investigated and the taxi cab company involved in the incident may have been identified. While PennDOT is vested with statutory power to conduct accident investigations, “it is generally undertaken for safety reasons and PennDOT is not ordinarily involved in interviewing motorists and assessing fault.” <em>Shoyer v. Philadelphia, </em>96 Pa.Cmwlth. 75, <a href="/pa-commw/96/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="506 A.2d 522" data-case-ids="1346134" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/96/0075-01">506 A.2d 522</a> (1986) (examining PennDOT’s investigative powers according to 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3754). Therefore, PennDOT was not a proper governmental authority to whom an accident victim may make a report under section 1702.</p>

Super. 295" data-case-ids="940014" data-case-paths="/pa-super/432/0295-01">432 Pa.Super. 295</a>, <a href="/a2d/638/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="638 A.2d 233" data-case-ids="7357519,940014" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0233-01,/pa-super/432/0295-01">638 A.2d 233</a> (1994), a panel of this court decided that under the statute the Philadelphia Fire and Rescue Squad was a proper governmental authority. The Rescue Squad appeared at the scene after a hit and run driver struck Gunter. The victim did not speak to any police officers, either at the scene or at the hospital. The <em>Gunter </em>court noted that the MVFRL is to be liberally construed to meet the statutory policy aims of protecting the innocent victims of irresponsible drivers.</p>
    <p id="b439-7" data-blocks='[["BL_439.7",439,[135,1860,752,675]]]'>¶ 6 In deciding that the Rescue Squad is a “proper governmental authority” under the MVFRL, the <em>Gunter </em>panel considered that emergency medical technicians (EMTs) complete forms containing information about the accident, the service rendered, their arrival time at the location, the name of the victim, and the injuries to the victim. The EMTs also sign forms relating to the accident. The court found that the EMTs’ conduct confirms the legitimacy of the claim and safeguards against the claim being fraudulent. <em>Gunter, stipra </em>at 240.</p>
    <p id="b439-8" data-blocks='[["BL_439.8",439,[137,2565,751,131]],["BL_439.9",439,[931,194,754,938]]]'>¶ 7 In <em>Owens v. Travelers Ins.

Like <em>Gunter, Owens </em>involved a pedestrian who was struck near an intersection. Owens reported the accident to her employer, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), which in turn reported the accident to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI). Relying on the definition of governmental authority set forth in <em>Gunter, </em>the <em>Owens </em>court concluded that HUP was not a governmental authority for purposes of the statute and therefore could not qualify as a proper governmental authority under the statute. The <em>Owens </em>court concluded that HUP’s reporting the accident to a government agency, DOLI, was not sufficient to satisfy the reporting mandate of the MVFRL.</p>
    <p id="b439-10" data-blocks='[["BL_439.10",439,[932,1180,754,1038]]]'>¶ 8 It is clear from the relevant case law interpreting the MVFRL that governmental agencies which are proper repositories for reporting under the MVFRL are those that care for victims of accidents such as governmental fire and rescue squads, <em>Gun-ter, </em>those agencies which investigate accidents such as law enforcement, and those agencies charged with the safety of the roads and highways, such as PennDOT. The purpose of the reporting requirement is not to establish technical barriers to recovery, but to prevent fraud and to assure that injured victims will report their accidents to governmental agencies whom they reasonably believe are proper repositories for this information. The law attempts to establish a balance between the prevention of fraud and the legitimate claims and expectations of accident victims.</p>
    <p id="b439-11" data-blocks='[["BL_439.11",439,[933,2265,754,437]],["BL_440.1",440,[216,193,750,188]]]'>¶ 9 PennDOT is an agency created by the state legislature. It has general supervisory power over roads and highways in the state.
