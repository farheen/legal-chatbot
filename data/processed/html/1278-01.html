    <p id="b1321-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1321.9",1321,[932,804,754,968]]]'>¶ 7 Appellant claims that his plea counsel’s ineffective assistance induced him to enter the plea agreement. Appellant asserts that both his plea counsel and the trial court should have been aware that he was statutorily ineligible for Boot Camp if he entered a guilty plea to statutory sexual assault, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3124.1, and indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3125. <em>See </em>61 P.S. § 1123. Appellant asserts that, although the Department of Corrections did not explain its determination that Appellant was ineligible for Boot Camp because of the nature of his offenses, “it certainly can be argued that, as a lesser included offense of aggravated indecent assault, a conviction for indecent assault could be deemed to statutorily bar him from eligibility.” Appellant’s Brief, at 13.</p>
    <p id="b1321-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1321.10",1321,[932,1797,756,761]]]'>¶ 8 Appellant was not statutorily ineligible for Boot Camp. Appellant satisfied the term of confinement and age criteria set forth in the statute. <em>See </em>61 P.S. § 1123. Further, Appellant was not sentenced for a violation of any of the enumerated offenses which make an inmate statutorily ineligible for Boot Camp; rather, he was sentenced for committing statutory sexual assault, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3122.1; indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3126(a)(8), and corruption of minors, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301(a). Thus, he was not rendered statutorily ineligible because of the offenses to which he pled guilty.</p>

The Motivational Boot Camp Act provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sentencing judge, in selecting inmates who are eligible for participation in this “alternative method” of incarceration “shall have the discretion to exclude a defendant from eligibility if the judge determines that the defendant would be inappropriate for placement in a motivational boot camp.” 61 P.S. § 1124(b). Here, the sentencing judge found Appellant to be eligible for placement in Boot Camp. <em>See </em>N.T., 5/12/03, at 7. If an inmate is deemed eligible by a judge, however, the inmate must still be approved by the “motivational boot camp selection committee” before he will be permitted to participate in the program. 61 P.S. § 1126(b). Thus, the Motivational Boot Camp Act makes clear that, after a common pleas court judge rules a defendant eligible for the Boot Camp program, it is within the Boot Camp Committee’s discretion to accept or reject a defendant for the Boot Camp Program. <em>See </em>61 P.S. § 1126(b). Ultimately, Appellant was not placed in the Boot Camp program, but neither Appellant’s plea counsel nor the sentencing judge could have anticipated that decision. Appellant’s plea counsel did not, therefore, render ineffective assistance in advising Appellant concerning his eligibility for Boot Camp under the Boot Camp Act.</p>
    <p id="b1322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1322.4",1322,[218,1978,756,695]]]'>¶ 10 Also without merit is Appellant’s claim that the PCRA hearing transcript shows both his prior counsel and the common pleas court to be unaware of a “de facto” Department of Corrections policy of automatically denying Boot Camp eligibility to inmates convicted of statutory sexual assault and indecent assault. Initially, we note that the record does not support Appellant’s suggestion that, in determining acceptance of an eligible inmate into the Boot Camp Program, the Department of Corrections operates in any manner other than on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p id="b1322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1322.5",1322,[1020,264,754,1233]]]'>¶ 11 Nor does the record show any misunderstanding on the part of Attorney Gross with respect to how the Department of Corrections determines Boot Camp eligibility. Specifically, Attorney Gross testified that, when he became counsel at the post-sentencing stage, he advised Appellant that the ultimate decision on eligibility for Boot Camp is made by the Department of Corrections, regardless of the judge’s eligibility recommendation or the neutral position of the District Attorney, and that there were no guarantees on Appellant’s acceptance into the program. As such, Attorney Gross’s advice properly described the Boot Camp eligibility and selection process, and the PCRA court found credible this testimony that he gave such advice to Appellant. This. Court will not disturb the PCRA court’s credibility assessments and conclusions made thereon where the record supports the determinations. <em>Commonwealth v.

This advisement, too, accurately described the Department of Corrections’ Boot Camp eligibility/selection process. Thus, we find that neither Appellant’s post-sentencing counsel nor the common pleas court was under a misunderstanding concerning Appellant’s eligibility for Boot Camp which has prejudiced Appellant in any' respect.</p>
