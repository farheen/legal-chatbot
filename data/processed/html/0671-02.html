The benefits of the time and money Appellant spent in refurbishing the property were arbitrarily conferred upon Appellee. Appellant’s defense, therefore, is that unjust enrichment of Appellee resulted from the setting aside of the sale. <em>See Duquesne Litho, Inc. v.

Appellee’s complaint was filed on October 23,1998, nearly three years after the alleged tax sale. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5522(b)(5) provides that the period of limitations for “action[s] or proceeding[s] to set aside a judicial sale of property” is six months. Although Appel-lee claimed in his answer to the preliminary objections that the statute was tolled because he did not learn of the sale for some time, at this point in the proceedings the expiration of the statute is a meritorious defense, as it would be successful if proven at trial.</p>

Based on the proposition cited above, therefore, Rule 218(b), seems to govern. This rule provides simply that in the event the defendant fails to appear for trial, the plaintiff may proceed <em>ex parte.</em>

    <p id="b708-7" data-blocks='[["BL_708.7",708,[200,1771,758,585]]]'>¶ 11 It could be argued that the judgment against Appellant was the result of an <em>ex parte </em>settlement conference, analogous to a Rule 218(b) <em>ex parte </em>trial, and that therefore the trial court complied with the rule. However, that argument would fail because the judgment entered against Appellant was not the result of the settlement conference and, even if it was, for purposes of Rule 218(b) an <em>ex parte </em>settlement proceeding is not analogous to an <em>ex parte </em>trial.</p>

The judgment entered against Appellant, therefore, was not the <em>result </em>of an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding. Rather, as the trial court Opinion indicates, it appears to be an arbitrary sanction inflicted against Appellant <em>before </em>the commencement of the proceeding simply because he failed to appear.</p>
    <p id="b708-10" data-blocks='[["BL_708.10",708,[1003,619,753,882]]]'>¶ 13 Second, a settlement conference may not properly be considered the equivalent of an <em>ex parte </em>trial for purposes of Rule 218, because no record is produced of the proceedings' at the conference; an appellate court would be prevented from conducting an effective review of such a proceeding on appeal. Therefore, conducting a settlement conference in the absence of a defendant is not a proceeding anticipated by Rule 218(b). Even though it remains true that Rule 218(a) applies to plaintiffs who fail to attend settlement conferences, the specific language of Rule 218(b) does not empower a trial court to conduct an <em>ex parte </em>settlement conference when a defendant fails to appear, only to proceed to trial.</p>

In the context of a settlement conference, as discussed above, the court may not conduct an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding; nor may it summarily enter judgment against the defendant.

There, judgment was entered against a defendant who had failed to appear both at a scheduled pre trial settlement conference and at the subsequent trial. Although we upheld the entry of judgment against the defendant, there are two important distinctions between <em>Frempong </em>and the instant case.</p>

There, the trial court found that the defendant had engaged in highly egregious dilatory tactics, and that justice favored a speedy dismissal of his claims.

I write separately, however, to state that I believe a defendant’s failure to appear at a pre-trial settlement conference does, in fact, invoke the dictates of Rule 218. For, when this same dilatory defendant fails to appear at the impending scheduled trial, judgment should be entered ágainst him or her.'</p>

Settlement conferences are by their very nature conciliatory, and, as the majority notes in its decision, “counsel is under the same duty to appear at conciliatory or pretrial conferences as he or she is to appear for trial.” Accordingly, if Rule 218 governs attendance at pre-trial conferences as well as at trial, then it must also govern settlement (conciliatory) conferences. <em>See Frempong, </em><a href="/a2d/744/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="744 A.2d 327" data-case-ids="11487092" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/0327-01">supra;</a> <em>Anderson v.
