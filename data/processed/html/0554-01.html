Prior to <em>Terry </em>the decisions in this phase of the law usually revolved around whether there was an arrest and, if so, whether there was probable cause supporting it. Now, more frequently than not, the initial issue is whether there was a Terry-type detention and, if so, whether it was supported by an “articulable suspicion” as required by that decision.</p>

In more cases than not, the real questions for the court now are whether the initial brief street detention by the police was based upon an “articulable suspicion” and, if so, whether the circumstances later had graduated into probable cause to arrest when the arrest occurred.</p>
