Huscroft was injured while playing in a regular-season game for the Portland Pirates, a Capitals minor-league affiliate. He filed a claim for unemployment benefits under the District of Columbia Workers’ Compensation Act (WCA), and DOES granted his claim. The Capitals contend that DOES erred in finding that Huscroft’s claim came within the jurisdiction of the WCA and in declining to limit Huscroft’s award according to the work life expectancy of a professional hockey player. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Under this “two way” contract, Huscroft could be assigned to play for the Capitals in the National Hockey League (NHL) or for its minor <a id="p715" href="#p715" data-label="715" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*715</a>league affiliate, the Portland Pirates, which competes in the American Hockey League (AHL). The Capitals play then-home games in the District of Columbia, while the Pirates play their home games in Portland, Maine. During the 1999-2000 hockey season, Huseroft played in thirty to forty games for the Pirates and in seven games for the Capitals. Huseroft was with the Capitals during the 2000 NHL playoffs, but he did not dress for the games. On October 18, 2000, four games into the second year of his contract, Hus-eroft suffered a career-ending head injury in a Pirates game played in Quebec, Canada.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He was thirty-three at the time of the injury, making him one of the oldest players in the AHL.</p>

The CRB specifically observed that the WCA covers injuries occurring outside the District of Columbia only “if, at the time of the injury or death, the employment is localized principally in the District of Columbia.” D.C.Code § 32-1503(a)(2) (2001). The CRB remanded, concluding that “a determination is required as to the nature of Respondent’s employment relationship with the District at the time of his injury, and whether that relationship constitutes a set of substantial and legitimate contacts with the District more significant here than elsewhere.”</p>

The ALJ found that the Capitals’ principal business was playing professional hockey games, that their arena was located in the District of Columbia, that Huseroft was hired principally to play in NHL games, and that ultimately, his participation in AHL games was “ancillary to preparing for NHL games” for the Capitals. The ALJ also rejected an argument that D.C.Code § 32-1508(3)(W) mandated Hus-croft’s award be limited by his work-life expectancy as a professional athlete. The ALJ awarded temporary total disability benefits from May to July of 2001 and temporary partial disability benefits from August of 2001 “to the present and continuing.”</p>

The CRB concluded that under the WCA, an award of temporary partial disability benefits may not be of an indefinite duration but must be limited to not more than five years, citing D.C.Code § 32-1508(5). The CRB also remanded for renewed findings of fact with respect to the causal relationship between the injury and the disability. The <a id="p716" href="#p716" data-label="716" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*716</a>CRB, however, affirmed the ALJ’s determinations with respect to jurisdiction and work-life expectancy. On August 8, 2008, the ALJ made renewed findings on the causal relationship and limited Huscroft’s award to five years, pursuant to D.C.Code § 32-1508(5). On October 31, 2008, the CRB affirmed the compensation award. While the Capitals did not re-argue the issues of jurisdiction and work-life expectancy before the CRB, they preserved them right to petition this court for review of those claims, and they timely filed their petition with this court. We have evaluated their claims under our well-established standards of agency review, and conclude that the compensation award should be affirmed.</p>

Despite the fact that Huscroft actually spent more time in Portland than in the District, the ALJ found his activities with the Portland Pirates, including playing in AHL games, were “ancillary to preparing for NHL games.” In support of this finding, the ALJ cited the testimony of Frank Provenzano, the Assistant General Manager for the Capitals at the time. Provenza-no, who negotiated Huscroft’s contract, testified that Huscroft was a good defensive hockey player, one who could step in and provide a veteran presence for the Capitals at the NHL level. Further, while Provenzano hoped Huscroft could also provide a winning environment for the Portland Pirates, he indicated that he “wanted a winning environment at the affiliate to obtain a winning environment at the ...

The Capitals contend that at the time of the accident, Huscroft was either at or near the end of his professional hockey career, and that DOES was required to limit Huscroft’s award according to his work-life expectancy as a professional athlete, pursuant to § 32-1508(3)(W) of the WCA. That subsection provides:</p>

This subsection, however, applies only to claimants seeking compensation pursuant to § 32-1508(3)(V)(ii), which involves “disabilities partial in character but permanent in quality.” It is therefore inapplicable to Huscroft, who obtained compensation under § 32-1508(5), the subsection dealing with his “temporary partial disability.” Pursuant to § 32-1508(5), temporary partial disability awards are limited to a period not exceeding five years, a limitation the agency properly applied to Huscroft’s award.</p>

The Capitals argue that under D.C.Code § 32-1501(17C) the Office of Workers’ Compensation is required to enact rules regarding work-life expectancy for professional athletes in each professional sports franchise in the District, and that thus far that Office has failed to do so. This, the Capitals’ argue, frustrates the purpose of § 32-1508(3)(W), which clearly contemplates limitations to a professional athlete's compensation award based on the end of his or her career under certain circumstances. While we understand the Capitals’ concern as it relates to other cases where the provision relating to work-life expectancy is applicable, that concern is not implicated here.</p>
