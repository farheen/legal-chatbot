Kraines appeals from the judgment in mandamus directing her, as Controller of Berks County, to effect payment of salary increases for thirty-five County employees. Kraines contends that the Salary Board did not properly approve the salary increases because the County Commissioners did not provide her, as a member of the Board, with individual employee performance reviews prior to the Board’s vote.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There is no merit in this contention and, therefore, we affirm.</p>

This budget provided an allowance for salary increases for all County employees. With respect to the salary increases at issue in the present case, the County Commissioners proposed that thirty-one employees receive a salary increase of <em>3.25%, </em>which was consistent with the general increase provided to the vast majority of County employees, both union and non-union.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> With respect to four of the salary increases at issue, the Commissioners proposed 8.6% for the Director of Personnel, 3.83% for the Manager of the Printing and Mailroom, 6.89% for the Director of Agricultural Land Preservation, and 6.56% for the Warden of the County Prison.</p>

Kraines requested copies of personnel evaluations and written goal reports for all of the employees considered for increases but the Commissioners refused to provide these on the ground that they are confidential employee records. Although she had not received the information she considered essential to an informed vote as a Salary Board member, Kraines took no action to compel production, but simply abstained during the vote at the Salary Board meeting on June 13, 2002. The three Commissioners voted, as members of the Board, to approve the proposed increases and, inasmuch as their votes eon-stituted a majority, the Board fixed the compensation of the thirty-five employees under consideration at the proposed increased amount. Immediately following the Board meeting, the Commissioners met in their legislative capacity and unanimously passed a resolution implementing the salary increases.</p>
    <p id="b846-7" data-blocks='[["BL_846.7",846,[1023,708,756,1392]]]'>Thereafter, Kraines refused to issue paychecks for the thirty-five employees at the increased amount on the ground that, in the absence of the information she requested, she was deprived of her vote as a Board member and, therefore, the Board’s action was invalid and the increase not properly approved. The Commissioners filed the present action in mandamus to compel Kraines to issue the paychecks in an amount that included the salary increases. At the same time, the Commissioners filed a motion for peremptory judgment. On the same day, shortly after Kraines was served at her office with the complaint and motion, President Judge Stallone convened a hearing on the motion. Following the hearing, on July 2, 2002, Judge Stallone in a ruling from the bench granted the peremptory judgment in mandamus and directed Kraines to “take all necessary actions to effectuate the salary adjustments in accordance with the resolution of the Board of Commissioners.” N.T. at 210. Common pleas entered a written order on July 5, 2002. On August 5, Kraines filed the present appeal.</p>

Kraines maintains that under the italicized language she properly refused to authorize payment of the salary increases because the Salary Board did not approve them by a valid vote.

The italicized language authorizes County Controllers to disburse funds only after the approval process required by law has been completed, not to take it upon themselves to determine whether there was some legal irregularity in that process. That is the proper business of the courts when cases are brought before them, not of County Controllers, most of whom are not even attorneys.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Applying this principle to the present case, the law requires affirmative votes by both the Salary Board and the Commissioners before wage increases for County employees may take effect, and both those bodies duly approved the new salaries. That being so, Kraines had no authority to withhold their payment because of her personal belief that the votes were unfair, or somehow legally flawed.</p>
    <p id="b848-8" data-blocks='[["BL_848.8",848,[1016,636,753,1096]]]'>Moreover, we do not agree that the vote was invalid simply because a member of the Salary Board wanted additional information to which <em>she </em>believed she was entitled.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> If Kraines thought she had a right to the information and required it to fulfill her duties as a member of the Salary Board, it was incumbent upon her to press the issue prior to the vote, through the court of common pleas if necessary. Absent a court order that the material be turned over and staying the vote until that was accomplished, the Salary Board had a right to go forward with its business. A member of the Salary Board cannot resolve a dispute of this sort by sitting back, abstaining from the vote, and then exercising a self-appointed veto power over the majority decision by refusing to issue checks in her capacity as County Controller.</p>
