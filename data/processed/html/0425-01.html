Specifically, on March 18,1970, petitioner was assigned to duty as youth home life supervisor at the Youth Correctional Center (YCC), a division of the Rhode Island Training School for Boys; he had held this position for ten months prior to the incident of which he complains. Five days per week, petitioner worked a shift beginning at 7 a. m. and ending at 3 p. m. Around noon on the date in question, petitioner’s immediate supervisor notified him that the person who would normally relieve petitioner at 3 p. m. was ill and that petitioner had to remain on the job until a replacement could be obtained. Efforts made to find a replacement, however, were unavailing. At 3 p. m., petitioner agreed to stay for one more hour but stated that he would then leave for the day. His supervisor (Mr. Gervais) notified the superintendent, Joseph P. Devine, of petitioner’s response. In turn, Mr. Devine instructed the supervisor to inform petitioner that he must “stay until a replacement was found, and, if he walked out, as he was threatening to do, to keep right on walking.” This message was relayed to petitioner; nevertheless, he left his job at approximately 4 p. m. without having been relieved of his duty either by a replacement or by permission of his superior.</p>

The board held hearings over a period of time beginning May 13,1970, and ending on December 9, 1970. A decision confirming the discharge by the appointing authority was filed April 27,1971. From this decision petitioner claimed an appeal to the Superior Court on May 12,. 1971, pursuant to the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15.

Only by bifurcating the very sentence of the Act of Congress which conferred upon appellee the right not to be removed save for cause could it be said that he had an expectancy of that substantive right without the procedural limitations which Congress attached to it.

Congress was obviously intent on according a measure of statutory job security to governmental employees which they had not previously enjoyed, but was likewise intent on excluding more elaborate procedural requirements which it felt would make the operation of the new scheme unnecessarily burdensome in practice. Where the focus of legislation was thus strongly on the procedural mechanism for enforcing the substantive right which was simultaneously conferred, we decline to conclude that the substantive right may be viewed wholly apart from the procedure provided for its enforcement.
