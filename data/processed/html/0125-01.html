West Penn appears to be arguing that because the policy of the PSC (and of the PUC today) was that electric utilities should not be permitted to compete in the same service area, the effect of the certificate of convenience granted to West Penn’s predecessor in 1927 could not have been to create overlapping service territories, and the PSC must have intended to give the rights to the territory to West Penn.</p>
    <p id="ASn" data-blocks='[["BL_193.11",193,[923,986,758,1089]]]'>West Penn does not cite any authority to support the idea that it was improper or illegal for the PSC to create an overlapping territory in 1927. Although the parties do not dispute that the policy of the PSC and the PUC was and is not to allow competition between electric utilities in the same service area, Met-Ed points out in its brief that there is a difference between not allowing competition and not allowing overlapping service areas. For example, the PSC could have intended to create an overlapping territory for the disputed territory in this case, which was a rural area in 1927, so that either company could serve new customers in the area if it so chose. Or the intent could have been to give the customers some choice in a situation where neither company had previously constructed facilities in the area. Then, over time, as the utilities extend service into the region the PSC (or PUC) could divide the territory and modify the certificates as it is doing in the present case.</p>

We are merely pointing out that it is impossible for this court or the PUC to say, with this record, what the intent of the PSC was in granting the certificate of convenience to West Penn’s predecessor in 1927. Furthermore, as Met-Ed points out, a certificate of public convenience can only be revoked for cause. <em>Western Pennsylvania </em>

This argument is based on a statement in the ALJ’s decision that if West Penn wished to argue that the certification of West Penn’s predecessor to serve part of Franklin Township acted as a partial revocation of the right of Met-Ed’s predecessor to serve all of Franklin Township, West Penn must prove that Met-Ed’s predecessor was given notice and an opportunity to participate in the proceeding.</p>

The question of whether MetEd’s predecessor received notice and an opportunity to be heard in the 1927 proceeding is speculative absent such evidence. The PUC rejected this same argument by noting that the controlling factor for this issue is whether there is evidence that the certificate of Met-Ed’s predecessor was revoked for cause. Without such evidence, any presumption as to notice of the 1927 proceeding is immaterial.</p>

In support of this argument, West Penn cites the PUC’s regulation at 52 Pa.Code § 5.42(b) regarding petitions for declaratory orders. That section reads:</p>
    <blockquote id="b194-12" data-blocks='[["BL_194.10",194,[1075,315,714,326]]]'>A copy of the petition shall be served on the Office of Consumer Advocate, all persons directly affected and on other parties whom petitioner believes will be affected by the petition.

    <p id="b194-13" data-blocks='[["BL_194.11",194,[1036,666,753,1710]]]'>Met-Ed argues that inasmuch as it sought only to establish a territorial boundary which would not affect its existing customers, there was no need to provide those customers with individual notice. We are inclined to agree. Met-Ed’s petition states that both Met-Ed and West Penn are providing service in the western portion of Franklin Township and asks the PUC to draw a boundary line between the two. There is nothing in MetEd’s petition to indicate that Met-Ed considered the question of whether it should be permitted to continue serving its existing customers to be at issue. On the other hand, <em>West Penn’s </em>petition for declaratory order requested that the PUC order that all electric service in the disputed territory be turned over to West Penn and that Met&gt;-Ed be compelled to sell all of its distribution facilities in the disputed territory to West Penn. At the time of the motion for service West Penn had not yet filed its petition for declaratory order. However, West Penn filed its petition shortly thereafter and the two petitions were consolidated. It is unclear to this court why West Penn did not simply serve its own petition on Met-Ed’s customers, especially as that petition clearly would affect those customers if the requested relief were granted. West Penn does not argue that it was denied access to any customer lists from Me1&gt;-Ed. In any event, Met-Ed’s customers were not directly affected by Met-Ed’s petition. Therefore, MetEd was not required to provide individual notice to its customers under § 5.42(b).</p>

The ALJ therefore decided that notice should be provided in accordance with 52 Pa.Code § 5.14 which governs such applications. This was the basis for his order that notice should appear in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and in a newspaper of general circulation. West Penn in its brief cites § 5.14(a) which reads:</p>

The first is that the regulation states that an application is subject to “one or more” of the notice requirements. The applicant is not automatically compelled to provide all four forms of notice nor any one form. The second problem is that § 5.14(a) is not the section to which the ALJ was referring. The ALJ specifically referred to § 5.14(b) which is the section regarding applications for a change in service territory and which only requires notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and in a newspaper of general circulation.

However, <em>Barasch </em>involved the PUC’s approval of a contract for the purchase of electric power by West Penn from a small power production facility (QF). The contract would result in West Penn making payments to the other facility for future capacity costs in addition to energy costs and passing those costs on to its consumers. The court held that, because the contract would result in substantial increases in the bills of West Penn’s customers unrelated to their current consumption, a substantial property interest was involved and due process therefore required that West Penn’s customers receive notice of the proceedings.</p>
