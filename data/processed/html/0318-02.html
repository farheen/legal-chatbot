In 1963, Crown Cork paid $7 million to purchase a majority of stock in rival bottle-cap manufacturer, Mundet Cork Corporation. Prior to Crown Cork’s purchase of Mun-det, a small division of Mundet had manufactured products containing asbestos. While the division had ceased manufacturing asbestos products prior to Crown Cork gaining majority control of Mundet, the division still existed at the time of purchase. Ninety days after Crown Cork’s acquisition of Mundet, the prior asbestos producing division was sold. Subsequently, and for reasons immaterial to this appeal, Crown Cork merged Mundet into itself, thus creating a single corporate entity. As a result of the merger, and in accord with Pennsylvania’s rules of successor liability of corporations, Crown Cork became named as a defendant in several asbestos cases, and has since spent hundreds of millions of dollars on asbestos-related defenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Second, there is a direct connection between the constitutional violations asserted and the harm complained of, as Crown Cork is invoking the protections of a potentially unconstitutional statute to obtain automatic and irreversible dismissal of Plaintiffs’ causes of action.

Thus, the invocation of Section 1929.1 by Crown Cork has aggrieved them, such that standing is present. Moreover, the ability of Plaintiffs to recover from other manufacturers is of no concern within the instant analysis. We thus reverse the order of the Superior Court, which had affirmed the trial courts’ grants of summary judgment.

For example, Standard Pennsylvania Practice notes the <em>William Penn Parking Garage </em>and <em>Biester </em>concept that, as a "guideline,” "standing will be found more readily where protection of the type of interest asserted is among the policies underlying the legal rule relied upon....” Std. Pa. Prac.2d § 14:23 (citing <em>William Penn Parking </em>Garage). However, this treatise then cites to the <em>South Whitehall Township </em>language, that suggests the immediacy prong is found "where the interest that the party seeks to protect is within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question." <em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="5 U.S.C. §§ 500">Id.</a> </em>(citing S. <em>Whitehall Twp.).</em>
