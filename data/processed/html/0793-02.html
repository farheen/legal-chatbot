This subsidy was provided to encourage school construction and in general provided that upon approval by the State Commissioner of Education (Commissioner), of the project and later the expenditures for the same, the State would contribute to the cost for “capital outlay purposes” made by the administrative unit.</p>

    <p id="b832-19" data-blocks='[["BL_832.18",832,[989,1982,748,759]]]'>But for the phrase “but not limited to” appearing in the definition of school building, the statute would define a school building as “any structure used or useful fqr schools and playgrounds, including facilities for physical education.” So defined, the word “structure” would control. As written the statute states that the term “school building” is not limited to any structure, etc., but this results in no definition and cannot be what the legislature intended. We read the bothersome clause as delimiting, but not obviating the word “structure,” by which word we are bound. Facilities for physical education must fall within that term.</p>
