Such a result, appellant contends, deprives him of the due process of law and the equal protection of the laws and subjects him to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

The Court reasoned that the alteration of a monitoring pipe, although a clear violation of the condition of the permit, did not result in the operation of a new facility that did not have a permit. Because MIDC had a valid permit, the Court held, Scarpone could not be convicted of causing and operating a waste disposal plant without a permit.
