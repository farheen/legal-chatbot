    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[193,984,753,908]]]'>On August 1, 1972, while at home with a Mr. Earl Byrd, Lamont Tazel, the owner of a janitorial service, was called to the front door of his apartment by someone claiming to have a package for him. After the door had been unlocked, the claimed deliverer of the package, along with two other men who had been concealed in the hallway (one of whom was the appellant), burst into the apartment. The intruders fired weapons and shouted commands to the occupants that they lay down on the floor. The occupants were struck several times by the intruders, who were seeking money and narcotics. Shortly after the initial entry, a knock was heard at the door. A friend of Tazel’s, Gilbert Batten, had come to visit and was summarily ordered to join the other captives.</p>
    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[190,1945,751,714]],["BL_558.6",558,[1010,234,744,87]]]'>Fifteen minutes into the robbery, Sergeant Osborne and Officers Catlett and Diubaldo of the Metropolitan Police Department arrived. Upon their arrival, they found Tazel and Byrd tied up in the apartment. The appellant and his companions claimed that they were the ones who had been held up and that they had simply overpowered their attackers. This artifice, however, did not last long. The police searched the apartment and discovered several weapons and some narcotics. The appellant and his companions were arrested. Tazel was also arrested for possession of marijuana, cocaine, and narcotic paraphernalia; he was subsequently granted immunity on the possession charges.</p>
    <p id="b558-7" data-blocks='[["BL_558.7",558,[1001,352,754,1006]]]'>At the trial, appellant admitted robbing Tazel and the others but testified that he had bought some marijuana from Tazel earlier in the day on August 1. He and his companions tried it and became quite ill. Thereafter, they returned to Tazel’s apartment and demanded return of their money. A Juan Johnson also testified and corroborated the appellant’s testimony. Prior to closing argument for the defense, however, the trial judge prohibited defense counsel from arguing the testimony of either of these witnesses to the jury. The ground for barring such argument was the representation to the court by appellant’s counsel that the defendants had stated to him that the truth was they had come from New York to rob complainant, whom they knew to be a dope pusher. Therefore, in the court’s view, the testimony of appellant at trial constituted perjury.</p>

The process of cross-examination is not only the acid test of the truth but is a constitutional guarantee for all criminal defendants. The general rule in this jurisdiction is that “it is proper to permit upon cross-examination the bringing out of anything tending to contradict, modify, or explain the testimony given by a witness on his direct examination . . . .” Mintz v. Premier Cab Ass’n, <a href="" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="75 U.S. App. D.C. 389">75 U.S.App.D.C. 389</a>, <a href="/f2d/127/0744-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="127 F.2d 744" data-case-ids="1077687,3559541" data-case-paths="/f2d/127/0744-01">127 F.2d 744</a> (1942), <em>quoting </em>Washington Ry. &amp; Electric Co. v.

But, “[wjhile cross-examination is a basic right, it is subject to reasonable regulation by the court in the interest of an orderly and expeditious trial.” Rogers v.

    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[176,886,750,955]]]'>Prior to closing argument, the court instructed defense counsel not to argue the defendant’s testimony since it constituted perjury. In view of our decision, we do not discuss whether the trial court properly limited argument on this ground since the testimony, even taken as true, did not support the “claim of right” defense. The trial judge has great latitude in limiting the closing argument if such argument would “misrepresent the evidence or the law, introduce irrelevant prejudicial matters, or otherwise tend to confuse the jury.” United States v. Sawyer, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20U.S.%20App.%20D.C.%20297" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="143 U.S. App. D.C. 297">143 U.S.App.D.C. 297</a>, 299, <a href="/f2d/443/0712-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="443 F.2d 712" data-case-ids="773878" data-case-paths="/f2d/443/0712-01">443 F.2d 712</a>, 714 (1971) (footnotes omitted). If defense counsel’s argument would not support the “claim of right” defense, then to allow him to argue it, we feel, would misrepresent the law or confuse the jury.</p>
    <p id="b559-6" data-blocks='[["BL_559.6",559,[175,1896,750,808]],["BL_559.7",559,[979,236,750,1097]]]'>We now consider whether the testimony supported the “claim of right” defense. The testimony in question attempted to establish that appellant believed he had a right to retrieve money (allegedly $30) paid to Tazel for “bad stuff.” Appellant’s reliance on Richardson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>where the court sanctioned the “claim of right” defense in a gambling debt situation, is misplaced. There, the court said that the defendant lacked the specific intent to take the property of another if he had a good faith belief that he was entitled to the money. The facts in <em>Richardson, </em>however, differ significantly from the circumstances present here. In <em>Richardson, </em>the debtor knew he owed the defendant money and the defendant had several times attempted to collect his money. More importantly, in <em>Richardson </em>the amount owed the defendant was $270 and the amount taken from the debtor did not exceed $270. Here, the amount allegedly claimed by Smith was $30 and the amount taken was in excess of $500; what is more, Smith collected the $500 from the others who were in the apartment as well as from Tazel. Because of these key differences, it cannot be said that Smith lacked the specific intent to rob Tazel, Byrd, and Batten. Therefore, Smith’s testimony and that of his corroborating witness did not establish a “claim of right” defense, and to allow counsel to argue the testimony would have either misrepresented the law or tended to confuse the jury. The trial judge, being mindful of this possibility, properly restricted defense counsel’s closing argument.</p>

To hold that a ‘no benefit’ finding is implicit each time a sentence under the Act is not chosen would render section 5010(d) nugatory . . . .” <em>Id. </em>at 3053.
