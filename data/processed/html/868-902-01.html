    <p id="b901-16" data-blocks='[["BL_901.15",901,[938,1209,751,291]]]'>¶ 1 J.M. (“Father”) appeals from the trial court’s order entered September 8, 2009, granting J.M.R. (“Mother”) primary physical custody of the parties’ minor child, R.A.M. (d.o.b. 8/4/04) (“Child”). We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b901-17" data-blocks='[["BL_901.16",901,[937,1539,751,663]]]'>¶ 2 Mother and Father lived together in Maryland at the time of Child’s birth until January of 2007. At that time, the parties separated and Mother moved to her parents’ home in York County, Pennsylvania, in order to obtain a college degree. In March of 2007, Mother and Father entered into a custody agreement filed in the Maryland court, wherein the parties agreed to a shared legal and physical custody arrangement. Mother had physical custody every other weekend and up to three nights per week.</p>
    <p id="b901-18" data-blocks='[["BL_901.17",901,[936,2232,752,454]],["BL_902.1",902,[195,275,751,809]]]'>¶ 3 Sometime in 2007, Mother began a relationship with her fiancé and moved into his York County home during Christmas of that year. In May of 2008, Father entered into a relationship with his current girlfriend in Baltimore, Maryland and, two months later, his girlfriend moved in with him. In August of 2009, Father and his girlfriend moved to her hometown of Erie, <a id="p906" href="#p906" data-label="906" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*906</a>Pennsylvania. Mother agreed to Father’s relocation, under the conditions that it was temporary and for the purpose of assisting in the medical treatment of the daughter of Father’s girlfriend, and that Mother would see Child based on the same schedule. However, due to severe weather, the custody schedule was difficult to maintain from Erie to York County. In February of 2009, Father informed Mother that she would no longer see Child pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Maryland court order, and that he was not moving back to Baltimore. As a result, Mother filed the instant custody petition, on March 23, 2009.</p>
    <p id="b902-4" data-blocks='[["BL_902.4",902,[194,1119,751,654]]]'>¶ 4 Father initially filed preliminary objections based on venue, requesting that the case be dismissed or transferred to Erie County, Pennsylvania. The trial court denied this request, holding that Mother and Father shared physical custody and, therefore, jurisdiction in York County was proper. The trial court held hearings on the custody matter on July 27 and 28, 2009. In an order entered on September 8, 2009, the trial court granted primary physical custody of Child to Mother.</p>
    <p id="b902-5" data-blocks='[["BL_902.5",902,[194,1809,752,868]],["BL_902.6",902,[995,275,753,713]]]'>¶ 5 Father filed a timely notice of appeal from the trial court’s order on October 7, 2009. In conjunction with his notice of appeal, Father did not file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal (“Concise Statement”), as required by the 2009 amendment to Rule 1925 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure relating to children’s fast track appeals. Pa. R.A.P.1925(a)(2)(i). Accordingly, this Court entered a <em>per curiam </em>order on October 13, 2009, directing Father to file a Concise Statement by October 23, 2009. Father failed to comply, only filing an untimely Concise Statement on November 2, 2009. Father additionally filed a request in the trial court for his Concise Statement to be considered <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>On November 6, 2009, this Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Father’s appeal for failure to timely comply with our October 13, 2009 order. On the same day Mother filed an Application to Quash Appeal, which we conclude is moot in light of our decision to find waiver as explained <em>infra. </em>On November 9, 2009, Father then filed an Application to Reinstate Appeal. This Court vacated the November 6, 2009 order dismissing the appeal, and granted Father’s petition. The trial court filed its Rule 1925(a) opinion on November 9, 2009.</p>
    <p id="b902-7" data-blocks='[["BL_902.7",902,[993,1030,756,1647]]]'>¶ 6 At the outset, we must address Father’s failure to comply with two aspects of Pa.R.A.P.1925. Father failed both to file a Concise Statement along with his notice of appeal and, subsequently, failed to respond to this Court’s order requiring the filing of a Concise Statement by October 23, 2009. Pursuant to the newly-adopted provision governing children’s fast track appeals, set forth at Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(i), an appellant is required to file a Concise Statement with the notice of appeal and serve it upon the trial court in compliance with Pa.R.A.P.1925(b)(l). Although Father did not comply with Pa. R.A.P.1925(a)(2)(i), we decline to apply the bright-line application of the waiver rule adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Castillo, </em><a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="585 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="2472599" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01">585 Pa. 395</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="888 A.2d 775" data-case-ids="2472599,8998737" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01,/a2d/888/0775-01">888 A.2d 775</a> (2005). In <em>In re K.T.E.L., </em><a href="/a2d/983/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="983 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="7293060" data-case-paths="/a2d/983/0745-01">983 A.2d 745</a> (Pa.Super.2009), this Court addressed a similar issue and concluded that, in a children’s fast track case, failure to file a Concise Statement along with the notice of appeal will result in a defective notice of appeal, to be decided on a case-by-case basis. <em><a href="/a2d/983/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="983 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="7293060" data-case-paths="/a2d/983/0745-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/983/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="983 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="7293060" data-case-paths="/a2d/983/0745-01">at 747</a>. In the instant matter, Father’s misstep was not prejudicial to any of the parties and did not impede the trial court’s ability to issue a thorough opinion. Accordingly, we find the procedural error was harmless.</p>
    <p id="b903-4" data-blocks='[["BL_903.3",903,[143,277,752,1342]]]'>
      <a id="p907" href="#p907" data-label="907" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*907</a>¶ 7 Nonetheless, we are constrained to find Father’s issues on appeal waived for his failure to comply with this Court’s order directing him to file a Concise Statement by October 23, 2009. Recently, in <em>J.P. v. S.P., </em><a href="/a2d/991/0904-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="991 A.2d 904" data-case-ids="7291211" data-case-paths="/a2d/991/0904-01">991 A.2d 904</a> (Pa.Super.2010), this Court addressed a similar scenario. In that case, the appellant mother in a child custody case failed to file a Concise Statement along with her notice of appeal and, subsequently, failed to comply with the trial court’s order to file a Concise Statement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925(b). Similarly, in addressing the preservation of the mother’s issues, we relied on <em>In re K.T.E.L. </em>to find that her claims were not waived for the failure to file a Concise Statement along with her notice of appeal; however, her issues were waived when she failed to comply with the trial court’s direct order instructing her to file a Concise Statement., Because the mother did not comply with the direct order to submit a Concise Statement, we found that the issues raised on appeal were waived pursuant to <em>Castillo.</em>

Nevertheless, we extend the rationale in <em>J.P. </em>to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>in that Father failed to comply with the specific court order to file a Concise Statement. Consequently, we hold that when an appellant henceforth fails to comply with a directive from this Court to file a Concise Statement, any claims on appeal shall be deemed waived pursuant to <em>Castillo. </em>However, in the present matter, since at the time Father filed his notice of appeal, this Court had yet to address this precise scenario, we will proceed to address Father’s claims on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b903-12" data-blocks='[["BL_903.8",903,[944,399,749,143]]]'>¶ 9 We now proceed to address Father’s issues on appeal. Father presents the following questions for review:</p>
    <blockquote id="b903-13" data-blocks='[["BL_903.9",903,[986,563,709,403]]]'>I. Did the lower court lack subject matter jurisdiction to modify the existing Maryland order, where jurisdiction was based on [the] Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, and where the court determined the move to Erie was only a temporary relocation.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b903-14" data-blocks='[["BL_903.10",903,[986,988,708,820]]]'>II. Did the lower court err, in awarding the mother primary physical custody, by inappropriately applying the <em>Gruber </em>factors, against the child’s best interest where the father had been the child’s primary caregiver for nearly all of the child’s life, the mother entered into an agreement granting [the] father primary residential custody, and the mother acceded to the child’s relocation with the father to Erie, Pa. which served as the child’s primary residence for nearly a year before [the] mother filed the custody petition here at issue.</blockquote>

Father claims that, pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”), 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5401-5482,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> jurisdiction is retained in Maryland because of the existing custody order there, executed when Mother and Father lived in Baltimore. Father asserts that pursuant to <em>Bouzos-Reilly v. Reilly, </em><a href="/a2d/980/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="980 A.2d 643" data-case-ids="7294411" data-case-paths="/a2d/980/0643-01">980 A.2d 643</a> (Pa.Super.2009), the trial <a id="p908" href="#p908" data-label="908" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*908</a>court was required to hold an evidentiary-hearing to determine whether Pennsylvania was the “home state” of Child on March 23, 2009, the date of the filing of Mother’s petition for custody.</p>
    <p id="b904-4" data-blocks='[["BL_904.5",904,[187,553,751,1583]]]'>¶ 11 In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court did not address Father’s challenge to jurisdiction because the issue was not raised at trial. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 11/9/09, at 1. Father’s brief does not provide any references to the certified record or the transcripts to indicate that this issue was preserved at trial. Generally, this Court will not address issues not properly raised before the trial court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (stating that issues not raised in the trial court will be deemed waived on appeal). However, in the realm of subject matter jurisdiction, a court necessarily has the authority to determine whether it has jurisdiction to decide a case. <em>See Hanik v. Pennsylvania Power Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/308/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="308 Pa.

Further, any action or inaction of the parties cannot bestow subject matter jurisdiction upon a court that otherwise lacks it. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1032(2). <em>See also LeFlar v. Gulf Creek Industrial Park No. 2, </em><a href="/pa/511/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="511 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1798677" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0574-01">511 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="511 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1798677" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0574-01">515 A.2d 875</a> (1986). Therefore, our rules of procedure provide that either the parties or the court <em>sua sponte </em>may raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time.

Father makes an additional claim that Mother is prohibited from challenging his relocation to Erie because she waited almost a year after his initial move to Erie to file her custody petition. As noted, the trial court found Mother's testimony credible that she filed her petition one month after learning that his move to Erie was permanent. Accordingly, contrary to Father’s allegation, Mother promptly brought forth her petition for custody upon learning of Father’s relocation. Moreover, Father is unable to provide any relevant statutory or legal basis to suggest that a custody claim can be waived by failing to file a petition in a timely manner.</p>
