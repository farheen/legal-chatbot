In such case the bonds to be issued by the county are as to the county, original and not refunding bonds, and under amended Section 6, Article IX, Constitution, the county has power to issue such bonds only after the same shall have been approved by a majority of the votes cast in an election in which a majority of the freeholders who are qualified electors residing in such county shall participate.</p>
