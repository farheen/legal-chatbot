There is sufficient evidence to uphold Appellant’s convictions for aggravated assault and possessing an instrument of crime as well as criminal conspiracy. Therefore, Appellant’s claim of insufficient evidence has no merit and counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue it.</p>

    <blockquote id="b1236-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1236.10",1236,[1055,1209,715,917]]]'>The courts of this Commonwealth employ the test of whether the crimes specified in the original indictment or information involve the same basic elements and evolved out of the same factual situation as the crimes specified in the amended indictment or information. If so, then the defendant is deemed to have been placed on notice regarding his alleged criminal conduct. If, however, the amended provision alleges a different set of events, or the elements or defenses to the amended crime are materially different from the elements or defenses to the crime originally charged, such that the defendant would be prejudiced by the change, then the amendment is not permitted.</blockquote>

Of the four men outside the bar the night of the shooting, the information originally listed as victims the two men who were not shot. The Commonwealth’s motion to amend the information to replace those names with the names of the men actually shot was granted by the <a id="p1195" href="#p1195" data-label="1195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1195</a>trial court. Such an amendment is allowed if it does not charge an additional or different offense. <em>Commonwealth v. Lobel, </em><a href="/pa-super/294/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="294 Pa. Super. 550" data-case-ids="178396" data-case-paths="/pa-super/294/0550-01">294 Pa.Super. 550</a>, <a href="/pa-super/294/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="294 Pa.

The criminal complaint filed seven months before trial correctly identified the victims and those victims testified at Appellant preliminary hearing. While the Commonwealth provides no reason for its mistake or delay in correcting it, Appellant provides no evidence that amendment of the information on the day of trial prejudiced his case. Because the Commonwealth’s amendment neither changed the offenses charged nor prejudiced Appellant’s case, Appellant’s claim has no merit and counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue it.</p>
    <p id="b1237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.4",1237,[176,1304,751,404]]]'>¶ 15 Appellant’s final claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly answered a jury question concerning the law of criminal conspiracy. In the instant case, the jury was initially instructed as to the law of criminal conspiracy. During deliberation, the jury posed the following question to the trial court:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.5",1237,[214,1726,712,300]]]'>If found guilty on criminal conspiracy, must he be found guilty on all other charges? If not found guilty on criminal conspiracy, can he be found guilty on all other charges? Please answer individually on each question yes or no.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1237-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.6",1237,[176,2046,751,664]],["BL_1237.7",1237,[978,302,749,89]]]'>N.T., 4/13/99, at 138. Appellant’s trial counsel requested that the trial court answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative. The prosecutor requested that a statement she submitted be used by the trial court to answer the jury’s questions. The trial court decided to redeliver the standard charge on criminal conspiracy which defined the term “co-conspirator,” explained the elements of the crime, and explained that Appellant could not be found guilty solely because of his presence at the scene of the crime, his association with the shooter or his knowledge of the conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="b1237-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.8",1237,[973,415,756,1372]]]'>¶ 16 The scope of supplemental instructions given in response to a jury’s request rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth v. Akers, </em><a href="/pa-super/392/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="392 Pa. Super. 170" data-case-ids="875839" data-case-paths="/pa-super/392/0170-01">392 Pa.Super. 170</a>, <a href="/pa-super/392/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="392 Pa. Super. 170" data-case-ids="875839" data-case-paths="/pa-super/392/0170-01">572 A.2d 746</a>, 755 (1990). There may be situations in which a trial judge may decline to answer questions put by the jury, but where a jury returns on its own motion indicating confusion, the .court has the duty to give such additional instructions on the law as the court may think necessary to clarify the jury’s doubt or confusion. <em>Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa-super/274/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="274 Pa. Super. 560" data-case-ids="138864" data-case-paths="/pa-super/274/0560-01">274 Pa.Super. 560</a>, <a href="/pa-super/274/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="274 Pa. Super. 560" data-case-ids="138864" data-case-paths="/pa-super/274/0560-01">418 A.2d 548</a>, 552 (1980). After re-charging the jury, the trial court asked whether any juror wanted him to redefine criminal conspiracy again and none did. Furthermore, the jury did not return with any further questions before rendering its verdict. This reflects that the trial court judge, using his discretion, provided additional instructions on the law that clarified the jury’s initial doubt or confusion. Therefore, Appellant incurred no prejudice. His claim has no merit and counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue it.</p>
