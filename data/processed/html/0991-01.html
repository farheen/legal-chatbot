To support his argument that he would be precluded from challenging his ineffectiveness claim in a collateral petition, Millward cites 42 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 9574-76, which set forth the Commonwealth’s time requirements for filing an answer to a petition for unitary review in death penalty cases and the court’s time requirements for determining whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted and for disposing of the petition for unitary review in death penalty cases.</p>

It is not alleged that Millward’s trial counsel was absent during any critical stage of the prosecution. A review of the certified record demonstrates that counsel subjected the prosecution’s case to adversarial testing. It is certainly plausible that counsel believed he could effectively cross-examine the prosecution’s witness. If we were to find that counsel’s failure to call an expert (or any other kind of) witness here amounted to the actual or constructive denial of counsel, what the Supreme Court <a id="p997" href="#p997" data-label="997" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*997</a>stated would be an exception to its general rule under “limited circumstances” would swallow the general rule.

    <p id="b1045-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1045.4",1045,[101,563,752,973]]]'>¶ 15 Finally, Millward contends that we may reach the merits of this case under the plain error doctrine. However, as Millward notes, our Supreme Court abolished the plain error doctrine in <em>Commonwealth v. Clair, </em><a href="/pa/458/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="458 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="479736" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0418-01">458 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d 272</a> (1974). Since our role is to effectuate the decisional law of the Supreme Court, we cannot resurrect that doctrine. <em>See Commonwealth v.

We also note that, even if we could resurrect the plain error doctrine, Millward does not show how, under any test for plain error, his claim fits any standard of plain error except in a broad standardless sense which is what led the Supreme Court to eliminate that doctrine in the first place. <em>See Clair, </em><a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d at 273</a> (citations omitted).</p>

According to Millward, the Supreme Court in <em>Clair </em>indicated that an important reason for eliminating the plain error doctrine was the fact that basic and fundamental errors can be addressed in a direct appeal through the vehicle of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Since those claims are now to be generally raised on collateral appeal pursuant to <em>Grant, </em>Millward argues that the reason for the elimination of the plain error doctrine is no longer valid, and the plain error doctrine should, therefore, be resurrected. While we agree with Millward that an important reason for eliminating the plain error doctrine was the fact that basic and fundamental errors can be addressed via ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the <em>Clair </em>Court never indicated that such claims can be addressed in a direct appeal. Rather, the <em>Clair </em>Court (citing <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967)), which involved an ineffectiveness claim <em>on collateral appeal, </em>indicated that an important reason for eliminating the plain error doctrine was the fact that basic and fundamental errors can be addressed via ineffective assistance of counsel claims <em>on collateral appeal. See id. </em>at 274.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Accordingly, since the reason for the abrogation of the plain error doctrine remains valid, we see no reason to resurrect that doctrine even if we could.</p>
