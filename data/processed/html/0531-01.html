Summary judgment was entered depriving the District of a factual hearing into the legality of the execution of a search warrant because in a prior criminal action brought by the United States, the United States District Court had determined on a motion to suppress that the search warrant was illegally executed. Summary judgment was also based on the fact that in the preliminary hearing stage a judge of the then District of Columbia Court of General Sessions (now the Superior Court from which this appeal is taken) had discharged the defendant on the basis of suppressibility of the evidence due to unlawful execution of the warrant. We agree with the District of Columbia that it was not foreclosed from a hearing on the legality of the seizure. Thus, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>

Among the items seized during the search were four adding machines and $10,700.50 — all of which are the subject of this libel action. Subsequent to the execution of the warrant, Clarence Ray, Jr., an occupant of the premises and the present claimant, was charged with violations of the gambling laws. After a preliminary hearing at which evidence relating to the execution of the warrant was presented, the complaint was dismissed. The hearing judge found that probable cause to hold for grand jury action had not been established since the evidence was suppressible. Thereafter, Mr. Ray was indicted in the United States District Court by way of grand jury original action. Upon a hearing on a motion to suppress the seized items, evidence relating to the execution of the warrant was again presented and the hearing judge found an entry in violation of D.C.Code 1972 Supp., § 23-524,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> granted the motion, and suppressed the seized items.

The trial court granted appellee’s motion for summary judgment holding that “there [was] no genuine issue as to any material fact relating to the illegality of the execution of the warrant ... in light of the fact that two judges have held previously that the property [was] inadmissible as evidence.” As to the contention that the District of Columbia was not a party to the criminal case, the trial court took the view that the <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>United States and the District of Columbia were arms of the same sovereign, the latter being subsumed by the former thus to eliminate its party litigant status.</p>

Claimant Ray also argues that because the constitutionality of the seizure had been earlier determined, the trial court was not obliged to rehear and redetermine the same facts as litigated in the absence of a proffer of new evidence, and that, in the interest of justice and fairness, the two prior determinations should be deemed to have settled the issue. He finds strength in this position from the fact that the officers who executed the warrant were members of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
