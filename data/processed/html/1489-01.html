Lauren, having planned the pregnancy that gave her Ralissa, practiced prenatal care by refraining from smoking, drinking alcohol, and the use of illicit drugs. After her birth, Ralissa lived with her parents for about the first year of her life. Then Lauren’s relationship with Timothy started to deteriorate and she began using methamphetamine. During this time, Lauren took Ralissa to live with the child’s maternal grandparents, Irene and William Locklin.</p>
    <p id="b673-11" data-blocks='[["BL_673.10",673,[167,1666,1123,256]]]'>In July of 1988, the Superior Court of California appointed the Locklins as Ralissa’s guardians. Lauren testified that she did not object to the guardianship because she was addicted to methamphetamine and was not capable of properly caring for Ralissa. She also testified that she did not want Ralissa to end up in foster care.</p>
    <p id="b673-12" data-blocks='[["BL_673.11",673,[166,1938,1121,166]]]'>After the Locklins obtained guardianship of Ralissa, Lauren’s contact with Ralissa became infrequent and sporadic. Further, Lauren provided no financial or emotional support to her daughter.</p>
    <p id="b673-13" data-blocks='[["BL_673.12",673,[165,2120,1123,221]]]'>In November 1989, Lauren filed an Amended Petition for Removal of Guardian because the Locklins interfered with her visitation. However, she did not “follow through” with that petition because she realized that her drug dependency made her an unfit parent.</p>

Lauren travelled from Chicago at her own expense to visit Ralissa. Lauren also enjoyed time with Ralissa on three different occasions when the Locklins were visiting Chicago.</p>
    <p id="b674-6" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[231,680,1119,222]]]'>While in Chicago, Lauren met Bardul Duka. Bardul and Lauren were married in January 1993. In February 1993, they moved to Nevada so that Lauren could be close to Ralissa. Lauren visited Ralissa frequently. She dropped by the Locklins “pretty much every day” before work.</p>
    <p id="b674-7" data-blocks='[["BL_674.6",674,[228,908,1121,356]]]'>Unfortunately, it was not long before Bardul and Lauren began having marital problems. In April 1993, Lauren saw an eye doctor after Bardul struck her, and in a separate incident the following year, Bardul was convicted of misdemeanor spousal battery. Ralissa was not present at either incident. Bardul completed anger-control classes, and the district court found that Lauren and Bardul “benefitted from the counselling and the domestic violence is not likely to occur.”</p>
    <p id="b674-8" data-blocks='[["BL_674.7",674,[226,1271,1121,266]]]'>On January 17, 1995, Lauren filed a Petition to Dissolve Foreign Guardianship, or in the alternative, a Petition for Custody and Visitation which the Locklins opposed. After Lauren filed the petition, Mrs. Locklin instructed Ralissa’s school not to release Ralissa to Lauren. Lauren’s messages were often not returned and visitation arrangements were made through Ralissa.</p>
    <p id="b674-9" data-blocks='[["BL_674.8",674,[224,1542,1120,220]]]'>Thereafter, Lauren filed a Motion for Temporary Visitation which resulted in a court order granting Lauren visitation every other weekend and one evening each week. The district court also ordered Lauren to pay $100 per month in child support. Lauren made all of the payments and exercised every visitation.</p>

Dr. Araza’s evaluation of Lauren showed no indications of depression, anxiety, or serious psychological disturbance.</p>

Lauren testified that she hoped the Locklins would <a id="p1493" href="#p1493" data-label="1493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1493</a>remain closely involved with Ralissa. Dr. Araza and Ms. Cooney testified that Mrs. Locklin’s attitude was not in Ralissa’s best interests.</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[165,418,1122,450]]]'>Dr. Araza’s evaluation of Ralissa indicated that she was comfortable with, and related well with her mother. He also indicated that Ralissa is “slightly more secure” with Mrs. Locklin, explaining that this was “reinforced by stable friends and routine.” Dr. Araza recommended placement with the Locklins, and stated that Lauren’s reentry into Ralissa’s life “still carries with it some lack of continuity.” Dr. Araza also testified that Ralissa is capable of creating a strong emotional bond with her mother over time, that Lauren presents no danger to Ralissa, and that he could see no “psychological injury that could not be overcome.”</p>
    <p id="b675-6" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[162,874,1123,395]]]'>After hearing the evidence, the district court made the following findings of fact: (1) Lauren exhibited concern for Ralissa over these years; (2) she never showed any intent, by her acts, to abandon her daughter; (3) Lauren’s desire to be with Ralissa was a prime motivating factor for ending her drug dependency; (4) she had consistently been involved with Ralissa since overcoming her habit; and (5) Lauren realistically took considerable time to create a relationship with her daughter and did not selfishly seek her own interests.</p>
    <p id="b675-7" data-blocks='[["BL_675.6",675,[160,1283,1126,359]]]'>The district court awarded custody to Lauren and visitation to the Locklins, but determined that it was in the child’s best interest to defer termination of the Locklin’s guardianship until the end of the school year. The court found Lauren to be a fit parent, and that sporadic contact with Ralissa for a period of approximately four years, which ended about three years prior to the hearing, was not a sufficiently inordinate circumstance to overcome the parental presumption set forth in NRS 125.500(1).</p>

Four years after her release from prison, Lisa filed a petition to dissolve the guardianship. This court determined that the district court erred in refusing to dissolve the guardianship because Lisa was a fit parent who had continually been an active part of her child’s life, and that “[t]he fact that the Bennums have had custody ... for an extended period of time does not amount to an extraordinary circumstance that could overcome the parental preference doctrine.” <em><a href="/nev/111/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="111 Nev. 35" data-case-ids="11921361" data-case-paths="/nev/111/0035-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/nev/111/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="111 Nev. 35" data-case-ids="11921361" data-case-paths="/nev/111/0035-01">at 38</a>, <a href="/nev/111/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="111 Nev. 35" data-case-ids="11921361" data-case-paths="/nev/111/0035-01">888 P.2d at 440-441</a>.</p>

The weight and credibility to be given trial testimony is solely the province of the trier of fact, and a district court’s findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.

Our review of the record revealed no basis for concluding that the district court erroneously found that Lauren’s testimony substantially supported the determination that Lauren did not abandon Ralissa. Therefore, in this case, the manner in which the guardianship was established was not a sufficiently extraordinary circumstance to overcome the parental preference presumption.</p>

The evidence shows that Lauren moved to Chicago to live with her brother while she conquered her drug addiction. It also shows that Lauren visited Ralissa when she was financially able, sent gifts, and kept in contact with her by telephone and letters. Lauren also claims that soon after she stabilized her life, she moved to Nevada to be close to her daughter. Further, Lauren testified that when the Locklins took Ralissa to Pennsylvania for a month each December, her visitation rights granted in California were denied because she was unable to contact them.</p>

In today’s society, to see our “prodigal” children return from the brink of disaster to productive, honorable living is an experience to be cherished.</p>
