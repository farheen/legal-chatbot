      <em> </em>We review this matter in light of the recent ruling in <em>In re Bailey </em>in an effort to apply its teachings consistently. In deciding the proper sanction here, we consider two issues previously addressed in <em>In re Bailey: </em>(i) whether there is substantial evidence to support a finding of intentional or knowing misconduct; and, (ii) whether this Court should order a six-month suspension instead of the Board-recommended public reprimand and two year period of public probation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

At all times relevant to the Petition for Discipline, Froelich was engaged in private practice in the State of Delaware at the law firm of Froelich &amp; Associates, P.A. Froelieh’s admitted violations, as summarized below, arose out of his real estate practice.</p>

The Zukoff Report concerned a random compliance audit conducted at Froelieh’s law office on April 18, 2002. The Zukoff report identified numerous areas of non-compliance <a id="p1119" href="#p1119" data-label="1119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1119</a>with the requirement of the Delaware Lawyers’ Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
    <p id="b1149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1149.4",1149,[111,377,754,992]]]'>The Zukoff report noted that there were six deposited checks that had been returned to the maker. Four of these deposited checks (11/15/01 for $18,559.17; 12/27/01 for $5,000.00; 2/27/01 for $3,000.00; and, 11/2/01 for $88,874.32) involved situations in which certified funds were deposited into the bank account of Cahill Paralegal, an independent paralegal service Froelich used to process his real estate settlements. An uncertified check from Cahill Paralegal was then deposited into Froelich’s escrow account. Each of Cahill Paralegal’s checks, however, was returned for insufficient funds because a local bank processed the Froelich checks before the certified funds cleared Cahill Paralegal’s account. These returned cheeks were eventually redeposited and cleared.</p>
    <p id="b1149-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1149.5",1149,[111,1401,752,444]]]'>The fifth returned check (3/28/01 for $123,069.05) was made payable to Cahill Paralegal. This check was endorsed and deposited into Froelich’s escrow account. However, the bank rejected the deposit because the first endorsement by Cahill Paralegal was not sufficiently legible. The check was redeposited and cleared on April 5, 2001.</p>

These wired funds should have been deposited into Froelich’s escrow account, but the funds were misdirected for deposit into the escrow account of Thomas Cahill, Esquire. Froelich did not discover the misdirected wire transfer until mid-February 2002, after Froelich’s bank notified him that his escrow account had negative daily balances from February 8, 2002 through February 15, 2002. While Froelich’s staff generally made a practice of verifying all wire transfers, this particular wire transfer (which occurred on the last day of the year) was not verified. Froelich notified Cahill pf this problem. On February 13, 2002, a check drawn on the escrow account of Thomas Cahill, Esquire in the amount of $111,469.44 was deposited into Froelich’s escrow account. This check, however, was returned for insufficient funds. On February 19, 2002, another check drawn on the escrow account of Thomas Cahill, Esquire in the amount of $111,469.44 was deposited into Froelich’s escrow account, but was again returned for insufficient funds. On February 22, 2002, the second check was redeposited and eventually cleared Froe-lich’s escrow account.</p>
    <p id="b1149-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1149.8",1149,[910,1086,754,792]]]'>Froelich used Cahill Paralegal to process his post-settlement real estate transactions. In most cases, Cahill Paralegal prepared all the documents not already prepared by the lender. Froelich would review all settlement documents at or before settlement, and would conduct the settlement at the offices of Cahill Paralegal. Cahill Paralegal was also responsible for preparing the title insurance policies, preparing satisfaction papers or reviewing satisfaction papers prepared by lenders, issuing checks to the appropriate recipients after settlement, and providing copies of settlement-related documents to Froe-lich’s clients and others.</p>
    <p id="b1149-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1149.9",1149,[911,1909,757,647]]]'>Froelich did not have a system in place for verifying whether or not Cahill Paralegal was fulfilling these obligations. During the period of December 2000 through March 2002, when reconciliations of Froe-lich’s escrow account ceased altogether, the number of aging checks in the escrow account accelerated rapidly. Froelich was unaware of this problem until his spouse, a certified paralegal who handles the books and records at Froelich’s law firm, informed him in late 2001 of the number of outstanding checks.</p>

      <em>In re Bailey </em>involved significant deficiencies in the both the financial record keeping at Bailey’s law firm (where he was the managing partner) and the firm’s tax reporting and payment obligations. Bailey was delinquent in his personal income tax payments over a period of several years. Additionally, Bailey failed to supervise his firm’s non-lawyer assistants and falsely certified four years of annual registration statements to this Court. In <em>In re Bailey, </em>we focused on the following facts: (i) the firm’s bookkeeper testified that Bailey instructed him on at least one occasion to transfer escrow funds to the firm’s operating account; (ii) the firm’s operating account was repeatedly in an overdraft condition over an extended period of time; (iii) Bailey knowingly directed $26,500.00 in personal expenses to be satisfied by charges against the firm’s operating account; (iv) the firm’s escrow account was the only viable source to cover these shortfalls; and (v) client trust funds were knowingly invaded by Bailey to satisfy a personal debt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> We concluded that Bailey acted knowingly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

First, no funds from Froehlich’s escrow account were deposited into his operating account to cover shortages or anticipated shortages. Second, Froehlich made no extraordinary expenditures for personal reasons from his firm’s escrow account. Third, Froehlich did not fail to file and pay federal and state withholding taxes. Fourth, Froeh-lich did not invade client trust funds. Fifth, Froehlich was successful in recovering funds from a misdirected wire transfer in February 2002. Sixth, the general practice in Froehlich’s office was to verify receipt of all wire transfers and failure to do so was a mere oversight. Finally, the forensic investigative audit did not reveal any other facts that suggest intentional, knowing or reckless conduct by Froehlich.
