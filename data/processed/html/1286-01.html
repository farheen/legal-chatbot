(R.R. 24a) In that case, John Alexander was arrested for DUI in November 1990 and accepted into the ARD program in April 1991. He was again convicted of DUI in February 1994. On September 30, 2000, the former Act became effective. Alexander’s third conviction for DUI occurred on September 5, 2001.</p>

Accordingly, by notice mailed December 25, 2001, DOT informed Alexander that his operating privilege was being suspended for one year and that he would have to install an ignition interlock device before it would be restored. The court of common pleas sustained Alexander’s appeal, finding that pri- or acceptance into an ARD program was not a “conviction” for purposes of the former Act and that only convictions occurring after the effective date of the former Act could be counted in determining <a id="p1289" href="#p1289" data-label="1289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1289</a>whether the ignition interlock requirement could be imposed.</p>
    <p id="b1329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.4",1329,[121,375,752,192]]]'>DOT argued on appeal to this Court that Alexander’s September 2001 DUI conviction was actually his third conviction under the former Act. We disagreed.</p>
    <p id="b1329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.5",1329,[121,591,754,908]]]'>Recognizing that a law is only retroactive when it relates back and gives a previous transaction a legal effect different from that which it had under the law in effect when it transpired, we concluded that for purposes of the former Act, Alexander had been convicted of only one offense as of September 5, 2001. Since Alexander’s acceptance into the ARD program and 1994 DUI conviction predated the former Act, they could not be considered prior convictions requiring the court to order an ignition interlock device. Thus, because Alexander only had one DUI offense occurring after the former Act’s effective date, it was within the sentencing court’s discretion to impose installation of an ignition interlock device.</p>
    <p id="b1329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.6",1329,[123,1523,753,498]]]'>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>DOT contends that <em>Alexander </em>is inapplicable inasmuch as it related to the installation of an ignition interlock device and this matter pertains solely to the requirement that Beck apply for an interlock-restricted driver’s license pursuant to Section 7003(2) of the former Act.
