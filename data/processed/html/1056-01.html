The findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or was clearly wrong. <em>Green v. Green, </em><a href="/a2d/559/1047-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="559 A.2d 1047" data-case-ids="7901960" data-case-paths="/a2d/559/1047-01">559 A.2d 1047</a>, 1048 (R.I.1989). After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, it is the conclusion of this court that cause has not been shown. The trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence, nor was he .clearly wrong.</p>
