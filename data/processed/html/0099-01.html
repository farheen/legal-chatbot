But where the parties, pending the divorce, have, by deed of settlement between themselves and a trustee, agreed upon a specific sum to be paid to the wife annually by the husband, for her support and maintenance, and other property such as a house and lot and servants, are secured to the wife for life.for the same purpose, the parties agreeing to live separate, etc., as in this case, the Court has no such power, for the parties have settled that matter between themselves. It appearing, however’, from the petition and evidence submitted on the hearing of the motion, that the husband does not comply with the covenant, by paying to the wife the annuity secured by the deed of settlement, which is necessary for the wife’s maintenance, the Court may, in Iris discretion, allow such temporary alimony as he thinks proper, not to exceed annually the sum secured by the deed for that purpose, (that was the sum fixed upon by the Court in this case:) <em>Provided </em>such alimony be allowed by the Court, and accepted by the wife as a settlement <em>pro tanto </em>of the annuity secured by the deed.

And we instruct the Court below to allow such alimony as he deems to be reasonable, <em>provided </em>it be taken as a credit on the annuity given in the articles of separation.</p>
