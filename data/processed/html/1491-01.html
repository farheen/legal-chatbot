Thus as the matter reaches us on appeal, we find appellant devoting a substantial portion of his brief and argument to the issue of “anticipation” arising under 35 USC 102(a), while the major thrust of the solicitor’s argument and brief is that the invention is not patentable because it was obvious within the meaning of 35 USC 103.</p>

The claims on appeal relate to a method for forming corrosion-resistant and paint-receptive coatings on metallic surfaces by the application of aqueous acidic solutions which chemically interreact with the surface to form the coating. The claims each contain limitations which define particular conditions under which the manipulative steps may be carried out. Appellant’s brief contains the following statement of the field to which the claimed invention relates:</p>
    <blockquote id="b816-5" data-blocks='[["BL_816.6",816,[269,1411,1329,370]]]'>The present invention is in the field of coatings for metal surfaces which are formed by applying to the metal surface an aqueous solution which chemically interreacts with the surface to form an integral coating, such as zinc phosphate, manganese phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, chromates and the like. The chemical reaction in products which are formed are integral with and tenaciously adhere to the surface of the metal and are useful as corrosion inhibitors, as a base for paint or other organic finishes, as aids in protecting the metal during bending, drawing or other cold forming steps either before or after the metal surface has been painted. * * *</blockquote>
    <p id="b816-6" data-blocks='[["BL_816.7",816,[268,1804,1329,549]]]'>Appellant’s contribution to this general field resides essentially in a method which involves the steps of pre-heating the metal surface to be coated, creating extremely fine atomized particles of the coating solution and directing those particles toward the heated surface, and continuously controlling the quantity and size of the atomized particles directed toward the surface relative to the metal surface temperature such that the particles react with the metal surface and remain in substantially the locus of their original impact. The number of successive applications of the atomized particles to the surface is selected to produce a surface which is uniformly coated with the predetermined thickness of the reaction product coating.</p>

They disagree, however, as to the statutory basis for the rejection predicated thereon. After a review of the record and the briefs, we have concluded that the statutory ground of rejection probably is 35 USC 103, for we agree with appellant that Curtin does not disclose the claimed invention with the particularity required by the decisions to be a direct anticipation under 35 USC 102(a). While it is somewhat hazardous to guess as to what the examiner meant by his statement that certain of the claims were rejected as “substantially met by Curtin,” it is somewhat less dangerous to speculate that when he rejected certain claims as “un-patentable over” Curtin, he was fumbling towards a rejection under 35 USC 103 for obviousness.</p>

It would seem to be obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art to utilize various particle size ranges and the optimum nozzle opening adjustment. Appellant seems to have arrived at the optimum ¾ turn nozzle opening adjustment for his gun in much the same manner as one skilled in this art would normally be expected to do in spraying a vertical surface, viz. successively decreasing the nozzle opening until no running excess appeared on the surface. We <a id="p1496" href="#p1496" data-label="1496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1496</a>think such nozzle adjustment with its resultant control of the atomized spray particle sizes would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this art.</p>
