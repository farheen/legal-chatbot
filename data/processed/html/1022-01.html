    <p id="b353-15" data-blocks='[["BL_353.15",353,[108,1166,1326,295]]]'>This is an appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office, one member dissenting, affirming the rejection by the Primary Examiner of claims 1 to 4, inclusive, and 6 to 9, inclusive, of appellant’s application for a patent on a method of oxidizing cyclic compounds. The rejection is based on a single reference, namely the patent to</p>

The sole issue is whether the effective date of the reference is March 31,1950, or July 1,1950. If it is the former then the reference is a statutory bar under 35 U. S. C. 102 (b) to the allowance of the claims in appellant’s application, which was not filed until June 2, 1951. If it is the latter, then there is no statutory bar, and the reference is overcome by appellant’s Swedish application filed June 12,1950, a certified copy of which has been made of record in the Patent Office, and which has been held to disclose the rejected invention. It follows that if the board correctly held March 31,1950, to be effective date of the reference the decision appealed from should be affirmed, but if, as contended by appellant, the effective date is July 1, 1950, it should be reversed. .</p>

Supp. 476</a>, was adopted as setting forth the proper conclusion. Accordingly, the “brevet octroyé” date of March 31, 1950, was held to be the effective date of the Du -Pont Belgian patent here involved.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[206,640,1324,942]]]'>The significance of the “brevet octroyé” and “brevet publié” dates of a Belgian patent is fully pointed out in the carefully documented and well reasoned opinion of the dissenting member of the board, which has been of great help in our review of this appeal. His statements of fact with respect to the significance of those dates appear to have been accepted without controversy by both parties. From those statements it appears that on the “brevet octroyé” date (March 31, 1950, in the instant case), which is normally less than a month after the application is filed, there is issued a decree which does not expressly grant specific rights but merely certifies that the application complies with the formal requirements. Nothing is sent to the applicant at that time, but he may ask for and receive as many official copies of the decree as he desires at any time after the “brevet octroyé” date. If he does not ask for such copies, a copy is mailed to him about six months after the date of the decree. The term of the patent begins on the day the application is filed but, as a practical matter, no court would grant relief unless it were presented with a copy of the decree, thus no suit could be effectively brought prior to the “brevet octroyé” date.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[206,1589,1322,442]]]'>The application is deliberately kept secret from the public until the “brevet publié” date (July 1, 1950, in the instant case), which is aproximately three months after the “brevet octroyé” date. Duiing that period the applicant may, if he desires, withdraw his application, in which case the decree is cancelled and the application is not made public. In the absence of such a request, the application papers are made available to the public on the “brevet publié” date. It is agreed here that at least as early as that date the application becomes a patent.</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[205,2039,1322,395]],["BL_355.1",355,[85,257,1332,551]]]'>The applicable Belgian law provides that the decree above referred to “shall constitute the patent” and the expression “brevet octroyé,” which appears on the printed copies of the specification, may properly be translated “patent granted.” In our opinion, however, the Belgian interpretation as to the “patent granted” is not in any wise binding on us as to whether the invention is patented there within the meaning of 35 U. S. G. 102. It seems to us that section relates to the substance of what is actually done in a foreign country, <a id="p1025" href="#p1025" data-label="1025" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1025</a>rather than to the form or the literal meaning of language used in connection therewith. It is extremely difficult for us to believe that Congress intended anything which might happen to be called a-“patent” in foreign countries should <em>ipso facto </em>be a bar to applicants, in this country regardless of how remote it might be from what is; generally understood here as being a patent. It may be that a foreign patent bearing a “patended” date is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that patenting took place on that date but where, as here, the facts as to what actually took place on the alleged date of patenting are not in dispute, the determination should be made on the basis of those facts rather than on any presumption.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[89,815,1327,747]]]'>The word “patent” is derived from the Latin “patere,” meaning “to be open,” and the significance of “open” is still commonly attached to that word. For example, Funk &amp; Wagnalls’ Standard Dictionary defines “letters patent” as “an open document, under seal of the government, granting some special right, authority, privilege or property, or conferring some title; expecially a document giving to the person named the exclusive right to use, make, or sell some invention.” Similarly the Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, after stating that “letters patent” means an open letter, explains that “Letters patent are so called because they were commonly addressed by the sovereign to all subjects at large and were not sealed up like a secret commission, but open, ready to be shown to whom it might concern.” The Encyclopedia Brittanica says of letters patent that “They are not sealed up, but are left open (hence the term ‘patent’) * *</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[91,1570,1326,698]]]'>It is also noted that in each instance in which prior patenting is made a statutory bar by Title 35 U. S. C., it is coupled with publication, by the use of the expression “patented or described in a printed publication” (35 U. S. C. 102 (a) and (b) and 119), which would seem to indicate a connection between patenting and availability to the public. In the recent case of <em>In re Tenney et al., </em>45 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 894, <a href="/ccpa/45-2/0894-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="254 F.2d 619" data-case-ids="6079547,685332" data-case-paths="/ccpa/45-2/0894-01,/f2d/254/0619-01">254 F. 2d 619</a>, <a href="/ccpa/45-2/0894-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="117 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 348" data-case-ids="6079547" data-case-paths="/ccpa/45-2/0894-01">117 USPQ 348</a>, it was pointed out that the apparent reason for making a prior description of an invention in a printed publication a bar to the granting of" a patent on an invention was that if knowledge of the invention was already available to the public there was no consideration for the patent grant. We think it reasonable to assume that prior patenting was made a bar for the same reason and on the assumption that a patented invention would be available to the public.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[91,2272,1325,196]],["BL_356.1",356,[238,263,1329,196]]]'>There seems to be no logical reason why the granting of a secret patent abroad should be a bar to patenting in this country. Such a foreign patent is of no value to persons in this country unless and until it is made available to the public. It is to be noted <a id="p1026" href="#p1026" data-label="1026" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1026</a>that even a widespread prior knowledge of an invention abroad does not alone bar the grant of a patent in this country, and it is not reasonable to suppose that Congress intended to give greater effect to secret patenting abroad than to public knowledge there.</p>
