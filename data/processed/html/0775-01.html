The Fellis could not have a cause of action against PennDOT for the violation of a statutory duty because PennDOT has only a general statutory duty to maintain and repair all roads and highways under its jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Section 407 of the State Highway Law, Act of June 1, 1945, P.L. 1242, 36 P.S. § 670-407 and Section 2002 of the Administrative Code of 1929, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L.' 177, <em>as amended, </em>71 P.S. § 512(a)(8).

At the time the decision in <em>Camp </em>was rendered, the Commonwealth was totally immune from all actions, but the liability of a local government was based on much the same duty for highways as is now imposed by the highway exception to sovereign immunity.

It must anticipate and provide against danger to persons using its roads for travel conducted in an ordinary manner. It must remove obstructions and defects which would naturally or probably cause injury to those persons who might have occasion to travel upon its highways. This duty is not confined to maintaining the bed of the road in a solid and safe condition and clear of obstructions, but extends to the erection of barriers or other devices for guarding unsafe or dangerous places on or along the road. If a public road through a township is so dangerous by reason of its proximity to a precipice that common prudence requires extra precaution, in order to secure safety to travelers, the township is bound to use such precaution, and the omission to do so is negligence.</blockquote>

In <em>Fidanza, </em>the motorist was forced off the roadway by an oncoming car that crossed into her lane. On the shoulder of the highway, her car hit used highway materials causing it to slide out of control, strike a tree, and slide down an embankment, finally coming to rest in a creek bed. The motorist alleged that PennDOT was negligent for failing to provide a safe shoulder on the roadway, depositing used highway material adjacent to the highway which prevented a safe return to the roadway, and the failure to install guardrails. We held that because the Fidanza’s alleged that conditions of the highway caused the injuries, it is for the fact finder to determine if the conditions alleged were dangerous conditions. <em>Fidanza, </em>655 A.2d at 1080. <em>See also Bendas.</em>
