A jury verdict was returned which apportioned liability between two of the three named defendants and Mrs. Hynes.</p>
    <p id="b512-21" data-blocks='[["BL_512.21",512,[1016,1540,748,843]]]'>The present controversy arose from the following sequence of events. On or about June 9, 1974, at approximately 4:45 p.m., plaintiffs, mother and daughter, were driving northward on Route 2 in North Kingstown in their 1970 Maverick. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. There was heavy traffic that resulted in “stop and go” driving. Mrs. Hynes testified that she came to a normal stop approximately five feet from the rear bumper of the car in front of her, a stop necessitated by the traffic congestion. Mrs. Hynes testified that she then removed her foot from the brake pedal, depressed the clutch, and put the car into first gear in order to be ready to move when the traffic congestion eased.</p>

Rochford III (Rochford) was driving a 1970 Dodge Charger approximately 125 feet behind plaintiffs’ car. He was traveling at a rate of speed of between forty and forty-five miles per hour. When Rochford realized that plaintiffs’ car had come to a complete <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>stop, he applied his brakes with such force that his car skidded for about ten feet. Rochford testified that he did not see any brake lights on plaintiffs’ car. Nonetheless, he was able to stop without colliding with plaintiffs’ car.</p>
    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[204,592,748,365]]]'>The defendant Michael J. White (White) was driving immediately behind Rochford. White collided with the rear end of Roch-ford’s car within seconds after Rochford had stopped. This collision caused Roch-ford’s car to move forward approximately eight to ten feet and to strike plaintiffs’ car from behind.</p>

McClarnon III (McClarnon) was driving a Dodge van two car lengths behind White’s car, traveling between forty and forty-five miles per hour. McClarnon testified that he witnessed the collision between White’s and Rochford’s cars. McClarnon, unable to brake effectively in time, collided with the rear end of White’s car.

Further, Mrs. Hynes had testified that at the time of the impact her car was in gear; therefore, the brake lights would not then be lit.
