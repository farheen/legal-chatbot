Appellant offered anecdotal evidence of his traumatic childhood and history of mental health problems through the testimony of his mother, sister, father, and two childhood acquaintances, all of whom indicated that they were willing and available to testify at Appellant’s trial. These witnesses testified that Appellant’s father physically abused Appellant and his moth<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>er. Appellant’s father rejected Appellant, and held out Appellant’s cousin as his true son. Appellant’s mother left Appellant’s father when Appellant was approximately five years old, and they eventually moved in with her mother; Appellant witnessed his grandmother fall down the stairs which caused her subsequent death. Appellant continued to live in the predominantly white neighborhood, where he was harassed because he was bi-racial and because he wore thick glasses. When Appellant refused to go to school, Appellant’s mother would discipline him by having male friends, as well as Appellant’s father, beat him. The witnesses testified to incidents in which Appellant appeared to be incoherent, angry, and/or depressed.

Counsel did not ask Appellant or his mother any questions about whether Appellant had been mistreated as a child or his mental health history, and this information was never volunteered. Nor did counsel attempt to interview Appellant’s other family members or acquaintances about Appellant’s background, or consult with a mental health expert. Counsel stated that he had no reason to suspect that Appellant had suffered any childhood abuse or psychiatric incidents.

Although counsel did not remember discussing the statutory mitigating factors with Appellant and his mother, he testified that it was his practice to do so. According to counsel, neither Appellant nor his mother ever indicated that Appellant had a history of abuse or mental health problems.
