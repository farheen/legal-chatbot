    <blockquote id="b707-4" data-blocks='[["BL_707.5",707,[98,490,1326,748]]]'>Indeed, it often requires as acute a perception of the relation between cause and effect, and as much of the peculiar intuitive genius which is a characteristic of great inventors, to grasp the idea that a device used in one art may he made available in another, as would be necessary to create the device <em>He novo. </em>And this is not the less true if, after the thing has been done, it appears to the ordinary mind so simple as to excite wonder that it was not thought of before. The apparent simplicity of a new device often leads an inexperienced person to think that it would have occurred to any one familiar with the subject; but the decisive answer is that with dozens and perhaps hundreds of others laboring in the same field, it had never occurred to any one before. The practiced eye of air ordinary mechanic may be safely trusted to see what ought to be apparent to every one. As was said by Mr. Justice Bradley, in <em>Loom Co. </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em><a href="/us/105/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="105 U.S. 580" data-case-ids="3495872" data-case-paths="/us/105/0580-01">105 U. S. 580</a>, 591: “ Now that it has succeeded, it may seem very plain to any one that he could have done it as well. This is often the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may be laid down as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that if a new combination and arrangement of known elements produce a new and beneficial result never attained before, it is evidence of invention. ”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b707-5" data-blocks='[["BL_707.6",707,[100,1249,1326,326]]]'>As a result of the authorities upon this subject, it may be said that, if the new use be so nearly analogous to the former one, that the applicability of the device to its new use would occur to a person of ordinary mechanical skill, it is only a case of double use, but if the relations between them be remote, and especially if the use of the old device produce a new result, it <em>may </em>at least involve an exercise of the inventive faculty. Much, however, must still depend upon the nature of the changes required to adapt the device to its new use. [Italics quoted.]</blockquote>
