Before approving the loan application, plaintiffs were required to pay the costs incurred for a title examination. The services of Maryland Home Title Company were engaged by defendant for this purpose and on December 3, 1954, certificates of title showing no defects in plaintiffs’ titles to the properties were' issued to it. Printed on each of these certificates were the words, “This certificate is made for American Building Association only.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Upon receipt of this information and the completion of other details incident to the loan, plaintiffs’ application was approved.</p>

Plaintiffs claim that as a result of the title company’s failure to discover the imperfection, the sale of houses constructed on this land was delayed for several months while the matter was being corrected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Their action instead is one in tort for negligent misrepresentation. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that since the certificates of title were a requisite for the loan, they had the right to infer that their titles to the property were clear and marketable when defendant approved their application. The reliance is thus upon the representations of the title company in its certificates issued to defendant. Plaintiffs further point out in their argument that this action was instituted against the defendant rather than the title company on the theory that the latter was the agent of defendant.</p>

The possible liability which might result from the communication of a statement to remote plaintiffs is so great, and may be so far out of proportion to the fault - involved, that there is general agreement that a more restricted rule is necessary in the case of economic loss than where there is tangible harm to person or property; and the difference in the degree of fault may perhaps call for a narrower responsibility for negligent than for intentional misstatement. But the point of limitation has been a subject of considerable discussion. When the representation is made directly to the plaintiff, in the course of his dealings with the defendant, or is repeated to him with knowledge that he intends to rely upon it, there has been no difficulty in discovering a duty of reasonable care; and the same duty has been found where it is made to a third person with knowledge that he intends to communicate it to a specific individual plaintiff for the purpose of inducing him to act. At this point nearly all of the courts have drawn the line, holding that mere reasonable anticipation that the statement will be communicated to others, or even knowledge that the recipient intends to make a commercial use of it in dealing with unspecified strangers, is not sufficient to create a duty of care toward them. Thus attorneys, ab-stractors of title * * * all have been held to be under no obligation to third parties.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The undisputed facts as shown in the pleadings, deposition of one of the plaintiffs, and exhibits reveal that the services of the title company were engaged by defendant. The certificates of title were furnished to the defendant with the printed statement thereon that the title search was made for it only. Plaintiffs did not receive copies of the certificates and so far as the record shows, no oral or written representations were ever made to them as to the status of their title by either defendant or the title company. They did not see the certificates or know of their existence until some time after the loan had been approved. Thus, the primary purpose of the information was to assist the defendant in determining whether the application for the construction loan should be approved. Any incidental benefit derived by plaintiffs from the information accrued to them in the form of the loan itself. We need not discuss the element of knowledge as there is a total absence of any showing that the title company knew plaintiffs might use this information.</p>
    <p id="b805-8" data-blocks='[["BL_805.8",805,[945,1400,747,950]]]'>So far, we have discussed only the duty of the title company and the rules relating to its liability. Relying on principles of agency, plaintiffs have brought this suit against defendant rather than the title company on the theory that the negligence of the title company is attributable to defendant. The application of agency law on the facts in this case is a tenuous one at best. However, even assuming its relevance here, no new duty toward the plaintiffs would evolve from its application; nor would the duty already defined in the foregoing rules be broadened. To impose liability on defendant for the mistakes of the title company on any ground other than that urged by plaintiffs would in effect make defendant. an insurer of the work performed by those engaged in the highly specialized task of searching titles.</p>
