In this dispute Charles E. Mee-han did not petition this court for writ of certiorari but instead filed an appeal seeking to have the decision of the trial justice overturned. We depart from our usual procedure and consider the appeal as a petition for certiorari in order to address the merits of the controversy.</p>
    <p id="b388-20" data-blocks='[["BL_388.20",388,[1036,796,747,376]]]'>After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and after hearing their counsel in oral argument, this court concludes that the trial justice erred in ordering an increase in child-support payments and in ordering that Charles Meehan be found in automatic contempt should he fail to make timely payments in the future.</p>
    <p id="b388-21" data-blocks='[["BL_388.21",388,[1033,1221,749,847]]]'>It is a well-settled principle in this jurisdiction that a party seeking to modify a support decree has the burden of proving the basis of need for modification by a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>McHenry v. McHenry, </em><a href="/a2d/424/1067-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="424 A.2d 1067" data-case-ids="7964751" data-case-paths="/a2d/424/1067-01">424 A.2d 1067</a> (R.I.1981). This court will only disturb an order modifying a support decree if we are convinced that it is based on findings that are clearly wrong. <em>Morry v. Morry, </em><a href="/a2d/426/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="426 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="7942526" data-case-paths="/a2d/426/0265-01">426 A.2d 265</a> (R.I.1981). In the instant controversy the record reveals no evidence of any need for modification. The only changes in circumstances are that Kathleen J. Meehan has inherited a sizable sum of money and that the child in question is currently three years older than when the original decree was entered.</p>
    <p id="b388-22" data-blocks='[["BL_388.22",388,[1032,2124,747,617]]]'>With regard to the trial justice’s finding Charles Meehan in contempt, the record reveals that he is often four to six days late in mailing child support payments. On the basis of this delay, the trial justice adjudged Charles Meehan in contempt and ordered that all future-child support payments be mailed on Friday of every week. Should he fail to comply, the trial justice stated, “the following week the man is in contempt, and [there] will be an additional $50 due on that week’s support payment.”</p>
