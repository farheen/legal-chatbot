The family of the victim was also terrorized. The victim immediately reported the crime to the police and described the clothing, including a bandanna used as a mask, and the physical appearance of the assailants. A few minutes later the police brought Fields before the victim, Fields matching the description previously given. Fields had been arrested a short distance away as he stood beside his car that had run out of fuel. The victim recognized on Fields the unique shoes worn by one of his assailants. He also recognized Fields’ other clothing, hair, and physique. An amount of money in $20 bills equalling about one-half of the stolen receipts was seized from Fields’ person. The red bandanna that had been described by the victim, and included in the broadcast as part of the description, was seen in Fields’ automobile and seized.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The basis for the trial court’s holding here appears to be the victim’s highly credible ability, from the crime encounter, to identify Fields’ hairline and physique in addition to the bandana and the highly significant unique shoes. There was testimony by the arresting officer that Fields was wearing those shoes a few minutes after the robbery, and, as observed, the bandana was found in the automobile where he was arrested.</p>

If a witness can make an identification (in court or at a lineup) from an ability acquired otherwise than from a state-sponsored proceeding about which testimony may not be received, neither the policies underlying the constitutional rule of exclusion nor the Jencks Act requires that that identification be barred. When an independent reliable capacity for identification exists, the automatic sanction of striking all such testimony would irrationally defeat the search for truth, for it is possible, in any event, to cross-examine the witness on that independent capacity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In short, there is no rational basis to impose a Jencks Act sanction in this instance.</p>

The occasion and setting for taking rough notes should be scrutinized with great care by the trial judge. Ordinarily these notes are hastily made by officers who are incapable of recording substantially verbatim statements. Before arriving at the decision that rough notes constitute a statement of a witness within the definition of the Jencks Act, the trial court should recognize that the very nature of the situation, and the expectation that a structured statement will later be made with the contents; of the rough notes incorporated therein, militates strongly against any notion that the notes themselves are producible statements. <em>Cf. Killi-an v. United States, </em><a href="/us/368/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="368 U.S. 231" data-case-ids="6169772" data-case-paths="/us/368/0231-01">368 U.S. 231</a>, 242, <a href="/us/368/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="368 U.S. 231" data-case-ids="6169772" data-case-paths="/us/368/0231-01">82 S.Ct. 302</a>, <a href="/us/368/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="368 U.S. 231" data-case-ids="6169772" data-case-paths="/us/368/0231-01">7 L.Ed.2d 256</a> (1961). Before considering imposing any sanction <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> for inability to produce a statement, the trial judge should make a clear holding based on hard evidence — not on speculation or surmise — that the lost materials constitute a substantially verbatim recitation and not, as is most often the case, merely a mnemonic note. <em>March v. United States, supra. </em>In making the decision the judge should not only keep in mind that the purpose of producing the statements is “to aid the search for truth”, <em>Hardy v.

Here, shortly after the robbery, Fields was arrested a few blocks from the victim’s house as he stood beside his disabled car. While the officer was momentarily stopping to assist him, a description of the robbers was broadcast. The officer noticed that Fields matched the description of one of the assailants. The officer also saw on the rear seat of the car the red bandanna mentioned in the radio broadcast. Fields had in his possession $560 in cash — all in $20 bills (at least one-half the stolen money was in. $20 bills) —and a gun with ammunition. He was also wearing the telltale shoes.

The question of permitting testimony concerning the subsequent lineup is one of identification, that is whether the victim could identify the suspect at the lineup as a result of his having observed him at the time of the robbery. This the trial court clearly found that he could do. Although the court is quoted accurately in footnote 3 of the dissent to the effect that it would have to rule out the testimony regarding the lineup, the court clearly reversed this ruling almost immediately. In response to the counter argument of the prosecutor it stated: “Yes, I will reverse myself. You are right. I have to agree with you.” The prosecutor then inquired if the court was making a finding of an independent source “for an in-court identification” and the court replied: “Yes. I am making a finding that there is an independent source based on the characteristics which Mr. Bruzzo saw during the robbery.” Thus, there being an independent source, the court permitted not only an in-court identification but also allowed the witness to testify, without further objection, concerning his lineup identification. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra, </em>in the opinion of the court.</p>

The government argued that if it could establish an independent source for the lineup and in-court identifications, then only the showup testimony need be stricken. The court acquiesced in this effort, and the complainant was recalled to the stand to testify as to independent source. Following such testimony, the trial court found no independent source for the lineup testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> Then the prosecutor argued that the Jencks statute did not bring into play the legality of a confrontation and since the showup was constitutionally lawful, the lineup could not be “tainted.” The trial court agreed.'
