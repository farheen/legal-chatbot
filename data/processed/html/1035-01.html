Following a two-day jury trial, Jackson was convicted of Attempted Assault in the Second Degree, two counts of Reckless Endangering in the Second Degree, Endangering the Welfare of a Child, Resisting Arrest and Operating an Unregistered Motor Vehicle. He was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to two years Level V imprisonment followed by six months Level 4 work release and probation.</p>

Since there was no objec<a id="p1036" href="#p1036" data-label="1036" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1036</a>tion to that testimony, the standard of appellate review is plain error. We have concluded that the witness’ comment was isolated and unsolicited, the case was not close, and the comment went to no central issue in dispute. Accordingly, the judgments of the Superior Court are affirmed.</p>

Staley was Jackson’s probation officer and knew that there was a warrant outstanding for his arrest for failing to report to his probation officer. Also in the pickup truck was Sheila Tiller, whom Graham recognized as a previous probationer. Unknown to the probation officers, seated between Jackson and Tiller in the pickup truck was Tiller’s six-year-old son.</p>
    <p id="b1070-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.6",1070,[202,1509,754,554]]]'>Upon seeing Jackson, the probation officers turned around and followed while contacting Wilmington police to assist in stopping Jackson’s truck. The probation officers followed Jackson on an “erratic” course through the city until he stopped on Church Street in an industrial area. Graham, who was driving, testified that he and Staley pulled up next to the truck, identified themselves and ordered Jackson out of the truck.</p>

Jackson then sped off in reverse until he struck a parked car. The probation officers pursued Jackson with their car also in reverse. They stopped their car in front of Jackson’s truck after Jackson had run into the parked vehicle. As the probation officers got out of their car, guns drawn, Jackson rammed the rear of the officers’ car three times. In that process, Jackson’s truck became wedged between the officers’ car and a fire hydrant.</p>
    <p id="b1070-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.11",1070,[1007,860,749,509]]]'>Wilmington police officer Shawn Gordon arrived at the scene in a marked police car while Jackson was ramming the probation officers’ vehicle. When Jackson got out of his truck and started to flee, Gordon, who was in uniform, drew his pistol and ordered Jackson to stop. Instead of stopping, Jackson ran away. Gordon pursued Jackson, eventually tackled him and took him into custody.</p>

Furthermore, the doctrine of plain error is limited to material defects which are apparent on the face of the record; which are basic, serious and fundamental in their character, and which clearly deprive an accused of a substantial right, or which clearly show manifest injustice.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The only reason probation is relevant is because based on the allegations of the State, it is inextricably intertwined with evidence of the criminal conduct alleged in this case. So you should not consider it for any other reason than to put the encounter that has been alleged between those officers and the defendant in context.</blockquote>

    <p id="b1071-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1071.13",1071,[983,1563,755,714]]]'>The State submits those instructions cautioned the jury against using such testimony “as evidence that [the defendant] is a bad person, or of a character that would be likely or more likely to have committed offenses such as the one [he] has been charged with.” Accordingly, <em>the </em>State contends those instructions also effectually mitigated any reference to Jackson being armed and dangerous. Jackson disagrees, noting that both of the trial judge’s instructions focused on Jackson’s probationary status rather than his reputation for being “armed and dangerous.”</p>
