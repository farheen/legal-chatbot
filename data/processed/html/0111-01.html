Plaintiff-Appellant Stephanie Butler (“Mrs. Butler”), individually and as Administratrix of Jeremiah’s Estate appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Newark Country Club (“NCC”) which owned the pond. The Superior Court held that NCC owed no duty to protect Jeremiah from falling through the ice on its irrigation pond because the pond was not an artificial condition within the meaning of the attractive nuisance doctrine and because it was a danger that children should reasonably understand. We agree and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

Jeremiah stepped onto the iced-over pond at any area that was far from the spillway pipe. He fell through the ice as he neared the pipe, where the ice was thinner. The ice was thinner at that point because, unbeknownst to Jeremiah, there were pipes pumping water through the pond for irrigation purposes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> These facts, which are unrebutted, support the Butlers’ claim that the artificial aspect of this pond created the hazard of uneven freezing.

If NCC wanted to demonstrate that this irrigation pond is no different than a natural pond, it could have presented expert evidence about the movement of water in ponds.
