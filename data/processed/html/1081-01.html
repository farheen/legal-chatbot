This reliance was misplaced. The purchase price agreed to by Santana and by Springfield Township 2000 Plus was based upon the value of the property as a salvage yard. This alone establishes that Landowner did not intend to abandon the salvage yard use. The fact that the <em>buyer </em>intended to abandon the salvage yard is of no moment. It is irrelevant to the seller’s intent. Under the Board’s analysis, the putative intention of a buyer, who could not close and could not speak as a landowner in any respect, preempts the express and unequivocal intention of • the property’s actual Landowner. Landowner’s consent to a sale of property at a market value determined by its use as a salvage yard does not imply consent to the future owner’s abandonment as held by the Board; indeed, Landowner would have no consent to give after Springfield Township 2000 Plus became owner of the property.

Although some of the cars stored on the property were removed, the salvage yard facility was physically unchanged.

The Board discounts Santana as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser because he did not close during the period of time that the Township and Springfield Township 2000 Plus, established by the owner of a competing salvage business, delayed the sale to Santana. Santana’s interest in purchasing the property was ongoing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Scholes believed Santana to be a serious buyer; accordingly, she took steps to purchase the property for the same approximate price, in order to delay or defeat the Santana sale. The Board cannot hold Santana remiss for a “delay” created, in part, by the Township. Further, it cannot ignore the undisputed fact that even the sale to the so-called <em>“bona fide </em>purchaser,” Springfield Township 2000 Plus, was priced according to the property’s value as a salvage yard.</p>

The ordinance defines a salvage yard as an “automobile salvage recycling facility” and as “an area of land, with or without buildings, that is used for the storage of used or discarded vehicles and parts thereof.” Section G-l of the Zoning Ordinance. The ordinance does not require a salvage yard to achieve financial success as suggested by the Board. Landowner met the ordinance definition continuously through December 2001 because the property was a salvage yard for the storage, or availability for storage, of cars and car parts.

This Court has made a prior determination dealing with this same property and Springfield Township in <em>In Re Appeal of Gemstar/Ski Brothers of the Zoning Hearing Board of Springfield Township, </em>133 Pa.Cmwlth. 115, <a href="/pa-commw/133/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="574 A.2d 1201" data-case-ids="1402893" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/133/0115-01">574 A.2d 1201</a> (1990). In that case this Court affirmed the decision of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas which reversed the decision of the same Board dealing with the same property. This Court ruled that the tire operation of Gemstar and Ski Brothers was a legitimate expansion of the nonconforming use of the property as a junkyard and Gems-tar/Ski had acquired a vested right to the permitted operation. Appellant asserts in her brief that the Township continues to attempt to extinguish the Sklodowskis’ salvage yard, and that their efforts have accelerated since the death of Joseph Sklodowski. Contrary to this Court’s ruling in <em>Gemstar/Ski Brothers, </em>the Board in the case <em>sub judice </em>found that the 10 acres leased to Gemstar has not been used as a salvage yard.

The unsigned Agreement of Sale between the estate and Santana indicates that the sale included all the commercial buildings as well as all fixtures, equipment, supplies and other personal property. Heichel testified that she thought Santana’s offer of $450,000 was for the entire 40 acre parcel, whereas Scholes’ offer of $425,000 excluded the house and the garage on a 3.3 acre parcel of land, and Scholes required the removal of all the commercial equipment.
