Knight and Wall Company filed this date. This cause will have to be reversed, however, because the declaration seeks to recover against the county school fund while the record shows conclusively that such remedy as the plaintiff may have is against certain special tax school districts in Pinellas County and the extent of the liability of each of said districts is not alleged or proven.</p>
