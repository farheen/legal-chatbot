Appellant had undergone a similar procedure in 1991 resulting in temporary relief. In his operative report, Appellee noted that he tore Appellant’s dural membrane, which covers additional nerves and protects the spinal fluid, but that he repaired the tear without incident.</p>

Although the motion was originally granted by Order dated April 25, 2002, the court subsequently vacated that Order because it had neglected to give Appellant an opportunity to respond. <em>See </em>Order, dated 4/29/02. Following the submission of briefs by both parties, the trial court once again granted Appellee’s <em>Frye </em>Motion by Order dated June 18, 2002. Appellee subsequently moved for summary judgment based on the preclusion of Dr. Austin’s testimony and Appellant’s resulting lack of expert testimony to support her medical malpractice action.

In that action, affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, AANS sanctioned Dr. Austin for what it considered to be irresponsible expert testimony in another medical malpractice case. Although the case involved a different medical procedure, Appellee contends, and Dr. Austin agreed, that the premise of his opinion in the former case was the same as here, that is, because a patient suffered an injury following surgery that was not present prior to surgery and the patient exhibited no anatomical abnormality, the injury must have occurred as a result of the surgeon’s negligence.</p>

Apparently, in the former case Dr. Austin opined, without any support in “literature or logic,” that the permanence of the plaintiffs nerve injury “establishes surgical negligence as its cause.” (Defendant’s <em>Frye </em>Motion, filed 4/19/02, Exhibit C, Report of the Professional Conduct Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons at 5). Moreover, he asserted that a majority of neurosurgeons would agree with his conclusion, a declaration that AANS’ Professional Conduct Committee found to be “entirely false.” <em>(Id.).</em>

Moreover, unlike in the former case, here Dr. Austin declines to assign fault to Ap-pellee solely on the basis of the permanence of Appellant’s injury, and does not proclaim that his opinion is held by a majority of neurosurgeons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Although we recognize that the disciplinary action involved Dr. Austin’s expert testimony in a medical malpractice case which bordered on a <em>res ipsa </em>claim, as does his testimony here, we remind Appellee that it was, indeed, a disciplinary action by a professional organization, not preclusion of testimony by a trial court applying the <em>Frye </em>rule.

Patricia Ayers, the plaintiff therein, suffered permanent laryngeal nerve injury after Dr. Ditmore performed surgery on the cervical, or neck, area of her spine. In that case, Dr. Austin opined that Dr. Ditmore must have been negligent in performing the cervical surgery because Ms. Ayers’s subsequent laryngeal nerve injury was permanent. <em>See </em>Report of the Professional Conduct Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons [AANS Report], 10/15/95, at 8, 5.

The AANS disciplinary committee concluded that there was “no convincing basis in either literature or logic for [Dr. Austin’s] testimony that permanence of a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury establishes surgical negligence as its cause.” AANS Report at 5. Dr. Austin received a six month suspension from the AANS as a result of his testimony, which the disciplinary committee described as “particularly egregious.” <em><a href="/f3d/253/0967-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="253 F.3d 967" data-case-ids="1269276" data-case-paths="/f3d/253/0967-01">Id.</a></em>

Essentially, there is no factual basis for Dr. Austin’s opinion, which, if admitted, would only have the effect of making Appellee a guarantor of perfect health. Dr. Austin’s expert opinion provides “no basis other than conjecture, surmise or speculation upon which to consider causation.” <em>See Toogood </em>at 1149 (quoting <em>Woods, </em><a href="/nm/71/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="71 N.M. 221" data-case-ids="5347864" data-case-paths="/nm/71/0221-01">377 P.2d at 523</a>). If we permitted such irresponsible testimony, “few would be courageous enough to practice the healing art, for they would have to assume financial liability for nearly all the ‘ills that flesh is heir to.’” <em>Id. </em>at 1151 (citation omitted). Even where <em>Frye </em>is inapplicable because no novel scientific evidence is proffered by the proposed expert, the trial court still must retain its broad discretion regarding the admissibility of evidence, and the trial court must be able to exclude expert opinions that are unreliable, speculative, and/or unsound and that fail to meet the same level of intellectual rigor characterized by other professionals in the relevant field of practice. <em>See, e.g., Black v.
