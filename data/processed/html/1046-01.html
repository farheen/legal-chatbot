The facts are different here. The incorporated record shows that the <em>registered </em>mark “OSTKEX” was, by the registrant (who was president of the Ostrex Company), transferred to his company a little over three years prior to the filing of the instant petition for cancellation, but during approximately two years of the intervening time the opposition proceedings hereinbefore spoken of were in progress, and those proceedings were based upon the Ostrex Company’s ownership and use of its said registered mark.</p>
