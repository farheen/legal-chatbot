No reference was made to any unlawful conduct. He was met at the door by a Mrs. Neville who invited him inside the apartment and advised him she had found some beer on the back porch of the apartment. The officer walked to the back porch and observed fourteen cases of beer.</p>
    <p id="b1191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1191.5",1191,[131,1087,750,808]]]'>The officer then went back inside and was advised by Mrs. Neville that the beer “did not belong there.” She then advised him that her son-in-law, whose apartment it later developed to be,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “to the best of her knowledge” had been arrested for stealing beer from a train. Realizing the apartment was close to railroad property, the officer phoned the railroad police and learned that a freight car had been broken into the night before and about 93 cases of Miller High Life beer had been taken. He requested that they send one of their patrolmen to identify the beer and he later removed the beer from the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The evidence seized was suppressed before trial.</p>

    <p id="b1191-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1191.13",1191,[932,648,752,517]]]'>The crucial factual consideration is that the officer was responding to a call that there was “found property” on the premises. He was not sent to the premises for the purposes of investigating criminal activity there nor to make an arrest. The government refers to it as a police response in the nature of a community care-taking function<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and we consider this an appropriate description under these exceptional circumstances.</p>

    <p id="b1191-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1191.15",1191,[936,1545,750,474]]]'>Since the officer was lawfully inside the apartment and then almost immediately observed the cases of beer, we conclude that no search took place within the scope of the Fourth Amendment in this unusual set of circumstances. Furthermore, on these particular facts, we conclude that it was not a search by a ruse. If it were either of these we would, of course, have a different problem with which to deal.</p>

Mrs. Neville was in the apartment in order to check on the dog and color television.
