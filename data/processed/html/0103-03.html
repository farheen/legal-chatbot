Shortly after 11:00 p.m. on July 19, 2005, the victim had just parked his car near 47th and Pine Streets in Philadelphia. As the victim walked towards his home, he was approached by a young, African-American male on a bicycle. The man asked for directions, and the victim stopped to provide assistance. A second African-American male, also on a bicycle, approached the victim. The second male produced a gun and told the victim to empty his pockets. The first male took a DVD the victim had been carrying. The second male took the victim’s wallet and cell phone. The robbers instructed the victim to “look the other way, just keep walking-” (N.T. Tidal, 5/12/06, at 47). The victim walked to his home and immediately called 911.</p>
    <p id="b139-8" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[114,1562,752,806]]]'>¶ 3 Officer James DeAngelo responded to the call, and the victim provided a description of the perpetrators as men approximately eighteen (18) to twenty (20) years old. The first male wore a white baseball jersey and hat. The second male also wore a hat. Both men rode BMX-type bicycles and fled southbound on 47th Street. Officer DeAngelo broadcast the descriptions over police radio. Officers Gregory Speck and Joseph Sees, who were both in plainclothes, were already on patrol in an unmarked vehicle near the crime scene. The officers began to survey the area, which was devoid of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.</p>
    <p id="b139-9" data-blocks='[["BL_139.8",139,[116,2401,749,144]],["BL_139.9",139,[916,249,755,765]]]'>¶ 4 Approximately ten (10) to twelve (12) minutes after the radio broadcast, the officers observed Appellant, and co-defendant Kareem Somerville, exiting a park near the intersection of 43rd and Chester Streets. Both men fit the general descriptions provided by the victim. Further, the suspects rode BMX-type bicycles and were traveling away from the crime scene. The officers followed the suspects at a distance, but the suspects kept looking over their shoulders. Appellant eventually removed a black backpack from his shoulder and threw it near a parked car. At that point, the officers exited their vehicle, identified themselves, and stopped the suspects. Out of caution, Officer Speck also drew his weapon.</p>

Officer Keller arrived as backup and conducted a pat-down frisk of Mr. Somerville. In Mr. Somerville’s right front pants pocket, Officer Keller discovered a loaded handgun with its serial number filed off. Officer Speck retrieved the backpack Appellant had thrown. Inside the backpack, the officers found a white-and-orange-striped shirt which resembled a baseball jersey, a black T-shirt, and two baseball caps. Additionally, the backpack contained the victim’s wallet and DVD. Shortly thereafter, the victim arrived at the scene and positively identified the suspects’ bikes and the clothing recovered from the backpack.</p>
    <p id="b139-13" data-blocks='[["BL_139.12",139,[914,1936,756,610]]]'>¶ 6 The Commonwealth subsequently charged Appellant and Mr. Somerville with robbery and related offenses. On May 3, 2006, Appellant filed a suppression motion, claiming the police “had no authority to seize [Appellant] or the backpack, nor to search either him or it.” (Motion to Suppress, filed 5/3/06, at 1). Appellant concluded all evidence obtained as a result of the search and seizure should be suppressed. Following a hearing on the matter, the court denied Appellant’s motion.</p>

The jury found Appellant not guilty of carrying a firearm without a license. The court conducted Appellant’s sentencing hearing on July 12, 2006. At that time, the court applied the “deadly weapon enhancement” provisions of the sentencing guidelines and sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of seven and one-half (7jé) to fifteen (15) years’ imprisonment. Appellant timely filed a post-sentence motion on Monday, July 24, 2006. In his motion, Appellant challenged the court’s application of the deadly weapon enhancement:</p>

Appellant argues the court did not satisfy the aforementioned elements; instead, the court overreacted after the prosecutor remarked that Appellant’s acquaintances had made her feel “uncomfortable” during an exchange outside the courtroom.

There, the defendant waited in a car while his co-conspirator attempted to rob a jewelry store. On appeal, we found that the fact that the defendant knew that the robber had a firearm was insufficient to warrant imposition of the weapons enhancement. We held that “the deadly weapon enhancement [was] inapplicable ... because the gun was neither on appellant’s person nor within his immediate physical control at any time during the perpetration of the robbery.” By contrast, in the present matter, there was evidence that [the defendant] was in the immediate vicinity of his co-conspirators when the gun was used to threaten the victim.</blockquote>

In <em>Dickson, </em>the defendant restrained the victim while his cohort pulled a gun, placed it against the victim’s head, and demanded the victim’s money and car keys. The jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy and not guilty of robbery. The court subsequently sentenced the defendant to a five (5) year mandatory minimum term, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9712(a) (stating any person convicted of crime of violence shall, if that person visibly possessed firearm during commission of offense, be sentenced to minimum sentence of at least five years of total confinement). Our Supreme Court, however, ultimately concluded the mandatory minimum in Section 9712 does not apply to unarmed co-conspirators.</p>

Rather, the court sentenced Appellant pursuant to the deadly weapon enhanced sentencing guidelines. Whereas the application of Section 9712 is limited to those who “visibly possessed a firearm,” the enhancement applies to a weapon “on the offender’s person or within his immediate physical control.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9712; 204 Pa.Code § 303.10(a)(1). Thus, Appellant’s conduct falls within the broader ambit of Section 303.10(a)(1).</p>

Our review of the sentencing transcript reveals the court relied upon the “DWE/Used Matrix (§ 303.18).” Specifically, Appellant’s offense gravity score (“OGS”) was ten; his prior record score (“PRS”) was “RFEL.” (N.T. Sentencing, 7/12/06, at 2). Under the DWE/Possessed Matrix, the standard range of the guidelines was 81-93 months. The court, however, announced: “The guideline range is 90 to 102.” <em>(Id. </em>at 10). The range of 90-102 months represents the standard range of the guidelines for an offender with an OGS of ten and a PRS of RFEL under the DWE/Used Matrix. Thus, the court utilized the wrong guidelines because Appellant did not “use” the gun, he only “possessed” it.</p>
