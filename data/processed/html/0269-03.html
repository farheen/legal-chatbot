On June 25, 2003, Womer commenced a civil action against Appellant Jan K. Hilliker, M.D. (“Hilliker”) by filing a praecipe for issuance of a writ of summons. On August 18, 2008, Womer filed a two-count complaint against Hilliker for negligence and lack of informed consent. In his complaint, Womer alleged that Hilliker is a practicing optho-mologist whose services were engaged to perform corrective surgery on Womer’s eyes; that Hilliker performed the surgery on June 7, 2001; that Hilliker failed to warn Womer of the risks, use the proper procedure, take the proper precautions, and treat the surgery’s complications; and that as a result of Hilliker’s actions, Womer suffers from permanent visual limitations, which have caused him to sustain a variety of losses. Womer did not file a COM with his complaint nor did he file a COM within sixty days of its filing, as is required under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3(a). In addition, Womer did not file a motion to extend the time for the filing of a COM, as is allowed under Pa.R.C.P.

No. 1042.3 requires; that his failure to file the required COM was due to his counsel’s oversight or mistake; that he was not notified of Hilliker’s intent to secure the judgment of <em>non pros; </em>that Hilliker would not be prejudiced by the granting of the Motion; that the purpose of Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3 had been served; that he promptly took steps to open the judgment upon learning of its entry; and that he possessed a meritorious case. One of the exhibits attached to the Motion included the curriculum vitae of an optometrist, Dr. Keith S. Hillard (“Hillard”), and a report (“Report”) that Hillard authored. The Report described Hillard’s consultation with Womer on June 5, 2002 regarding Womer’s visual status. In the Report, Hillard opined that Womer was not a good candidate for the particular surgical procedure that Hilliker used; that due to Womer’s myopia and pupil size, he was exposed to a higher risk of harm than are others; and that following the surgery, Hilliker did not treat a manageable complication promptly. Another exhibit attached to the Motion was a COM as to Hilliker dated October 21, 2003.</p>

No. 126,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Womer also alleged that a trial court’s strict adherence to Rule 1042.3 in his case would undermine this Court’s intent in adopting the Rule, which was to eliminate the filing of non-meritorious professional liability actions and that the en<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>try of a judgment of <em>non pros, </em>which would put him permanently out of court for a technical violation of Rule 1042.3, was too drastic a result in light of his substantial compliance.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[233,548,759,1924]]]'>The trial court denied Womer’s Motion. The trial court first rejected Womer’s argument that the discovery materials he served on Hilliker complied with the terms of Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3, concluding that such an argument contradicted the rule’s plain language. Next, the trial court determined that Womer was incorrect that his Motion should be evaluated under Pa. R.C.P. No.237.1, and held that Womer’s entitlement to relief from the judgment of <em>non pros </em>was to be assessed under Pa. R.C.P. No. 3051. The trial court then considered whether Womer’s belief that his discovery responses satisfied Rule 1042.3’s requirements provided a reasonable explanation under Rule 3051(b)(2) for his failure to file a COM, and concluded that Womer’s belief was insufficient. In this regard, the trial court was of the view that discovery responses, particularly information not of record, neither substituted for a Rule 1042.3 COM nor explained why Womer neglected to request an extension of time under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3(d) within which to secure a COM. Finally, the trial court determined that Womer’s assertions that Pa.R.C.P. No. 126 should excuse him were inappropriate since Rule 126’s application in the present circumstances would effectively nullify the terms of Pa. R.C.P. No. 1042.3. Accordingly, the trial court entered an order dated December 3, 2003, denying Womer’s Motion requesting that the judgment of <em>non pros </em>be opened, and denied the Motion for Reconsideration he filed thereafter by order dated December 15, 2003.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.8",304,[1037,280,751,830]]]'>Womer filed a timely appeal. In the Superior Court, Womer abandoned his argument that Pa.R.C.P. No. 237.1 governed his request for relief from the judgment of <em>non pros, </em>and argued his entitlement to relief from the judgment under Pa.R.C.P. No. 3051. Womer made all the same assertions in support of his Motion in the Superior Court that he made in the trial court, and added to his arguments in his Superior Court brief by stating that the judgment of <em>non pros </em>should be opened because Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3 was newly promulgated and the statute of limitations had run on his cause of action as of the date the judgment was entered.</p>
    <p id="b304-7" data-blocks='[["BL_304.9",304,[1036,1152,752,828]]]'>In an unpublished opinion, the Superior Court applied Pa.R.C.P.

No. 3051(b)(2), by providing a reasonable explanation for his lack of compliance with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3. As to the latter, the Superior Court focused on Womer’s contention that he did not file a COM because he believed that by giving Hilliker the Report he substantially complied with Pa.R.C.P. No. 1043.2, and found Womer’s belief “not wholly unreasonable” due to the lack of case law on the issue. The Superior Court stated:</p>

    <p id="A6F" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[137,918,757,1319]]]'>(Superior Court Memorandum Opinion at 5.) The Superior Court also observed that even though it did not disagree with the trial court’s opinion espousing a literal interpretation of Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3, it disagreed with the trial court’s result for several reasons. The reasons the Superior Court listed without discussion were: equitable principles; the statute of limitations; the recent promulgation of Rule 1042.3; the sparseness of decisions regarding the permissibility of substantial compliance as a substitute for a COM; and the existence of Pa.R.C.P. No. 126. Accordingly, the Superior Court reversed the trial court’s order and remanded the case to the trial court. On remand, the trial court was to obtain proof of facts by evidence or stipulation that Womer supplied the Report to Hilliker and, if shown, to enter an order vacating the judgment of <em>non pros </em>and consider the objection that Hilliker raised to Hillard’s qualifications under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.1 to supply the statement Pa. R.C.P. No. 1042.3(a)(1) requires. <em>See supra </em>n. 3.</p>

Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3 is one in a series of rules that “govern procedure in a civil action in which a professional liability claim is asserted against a licensed professional.” Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.1(a). <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1042.1-1042.8. We adopted these rules in January of 2003, having determined that malpractice actions were being commenced in the Pennsylvania courts more frequently. We were concerned that this trend would lead to an increase in the filing of malpractice claims of questionable merit, and sought to avoid the burdens that such claims impose upon litigants and the courts. Therefore, we exercised our rule-making authority to devise an orderly procedure that would serve to identify and weed non-meritorious malpractice claims from the judicial system efficiently and promptly. <em>See </em>pa Const. art.V, § 10(c); 42 Pa.C.S. § 1722. The procedure we provided in the professional liability action rules centers on the filing of a COM. On the one hand, the presence in the record of a COM signals to the parties and the trial court that the plaintiff is willing to attest to the basis of his malpractice claim; that he is in a position to support the allegations he has made in his professional liability action; and that resources will not be wasted if additional pleading and discovery take place. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.4, Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> On the other hand, the absence <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>from the record of a COM signals to the parties and the trial court that none of this is so and that nothing further should transpire in the action, except for the lawsuit’s termination. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.6.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[204,515,755,593]]]'>In this appeal, our primary focus is on Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.S and whether it is subject to equitable exceptions. We first observe that the Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3 itself sets forth no exceptions, equitable or otherwise, to its terms. <em>See supra </em>n. 1. Therefore, in this regard, we focus, as did the lower courts and the parties, on Pa. R.C.P. No.126, and consider whether the Superior Court should have allowed Rule 126 to play any part in excusing Womers’ failure to file a Rule 1042.3 COM.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Accordingly, we expect that litigants will adhere to procedural rules as they are written, and take a dim view of litigants who flout them. <em>See Wood v.

That said, we have always understood that procedural rules are not ends in themselves, and that the rigid application of our rules does not always serve the interests of fairness and justice. <em>Pomerantz v. Goldstein, </em><a href="/pa/479/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="479 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1742144" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0175-01">479 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="479 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1742144" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0175-01">387 A.2d 1280</a>, 1281 (1978). It is for this reason that we adopted Rule 126, which provides in pertinent part that “[t]he court at every stage of any such action or proceeding may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.” Pa.R.C.P. No. 126. With this language, we incorporated equitable considerations in the form of a doctrine of substantial compliance into Rule 126, giving the trial courts the latitude to overlook any <em>“procedural </em>defect” that does not prejudice a party’s rights. <em>Sahutsky v.

No. 1042.3. Rule 1042.3 is clear and unambiguous in its mandate that in every professional liability action a specific representation about the plaintiffs claim must be filed in the official record in a document called a “certificate of merit” at the time the complaint is filed or within sixty days thereafter. Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3(a). Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.8 provides that “the certificate required for filing by Rule 1042.3(a) shall be substantially in the following form ....,” and displays a sample COM that shows precisely what Rule 1042.3 requires. Moreover, Pa. R.C.P. No. 1042.3(d), which allows for the filing and granting upon good cause shown of a motion to extend the time for filing a COM, sets forth the one and only step that a plaintiff is to take if he finds himself unable to secure a COM and desires to avoid the consequences of not satisfying Rule 1042.3(a)’s COM filing requirement in a timely fashion. Womer, however, did nothing of the sort. Rather, he served discovery materials on Hilliker, which included an expert report. In our view, this was no procedural misstep within the meaning of Pa.R.C.P.No. 126. It was instead, a wholesale failure to take any of the actions that one of our rules requires, of the type that we have heretofore refused to overlook under Rule 126. <em>See Sahutsky, </em><a href="/pa/566/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="782 A.2d 996" data-case-ids="706218,706237,706327,9473214,9473227,9473247" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0593-01,/pa/566/0592-01,/pa/566/0593-02,/a2d/782/0996-01,/a2d/782/0996-02,/a2d/782/0996-03">782 A.2d at 1001</a>.</p>

No. 1042.3’s requirements, Rule 126 can apply in his circumstances because he fulfilled Rule 1042.3’s purpose, Womer is essentially arguing that the doctrine of substantial compliance in Rule 126 not only excuses a party who commits a procedural misstep in attempting to do that which a rule instructs, but also excuses a party who does nothing that a rule requires, but whose actions are consistent with the objectives he believes the rule serves. This is simply not so. The equitable doctrine we incorporated into Rule 126 is one of <em>substantial </em>compliance, not one of <em>no </em>compliance. We reiterate what our case law has taught: Rule 126 is available to a party who makes a substantial attempt to conform, and not to a party who disregards the terms of a rule in their entirety and determines for himself the steps he can take to satisfy the procedure that we have adopted to enhance the functioning of the trial courts. <em>See Sahutsky, </em><a href="/pa/566/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="782 A.2d 996" data-case-ids="706218,706237,706327,9473214,9473227,9473247" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0593-01,/pa/566/0592-01,/pa/566/0593-02,/a2d/782/0996-01,/a2d/782/0996-02,/a2d/782/0996-03">782 A.2d at 1001</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

No. 127(e) (“A note to a rule or an explanatory comment is not part of the rule but may be used in construing the rule.”). The Note that follows Pa.R.C.P.

Significantly, the Note does not also state that Pa.R.C.P. No. 3051 is inapplicable. Further, the Explanatory Comment to Pa.R.C.P. No. 3051 clarifies that the rule’s application is universal, stating that “[t]he rule adopts a uniform procedure <em>[and] will apply in all cases in which relief from a judgment of non pros is sought, whether the judgment has been entered by praecipe as of right or by the court following a hearing.” </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 3051 (1991 Explanatory Comment) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold that a Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.6 judgment of <em>non pros </em>is subject to a Pa.R.C.P.

The principle that demonstrates the correctness of the trial court’s determination, that is, that Pa.R.C.P.

Such a request, like a petition to open a default judgment taken for failure to respond to a complaint, is in the nature of an appeal to the equitable powers of the court. To gain relief, a plaintiff must show 1) the petition for relief from the judgment has been timely filed; 2) there is a reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the delay; and 3) there is a meritorious cause of action.

I respectfully disagree that such conclusion can be reached under the facts of this case. Womer filed a medical malpractice complaint against Hilliker on August 18, 2003. Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1042.3, he had until Friday, October 17, 2003, to file either a COM or a request for an extension of time. Within this time period, on October 8, 2003, during discovery, Womer forwarded to Hilliker an expert report detailing the manner in which Womer alleged that Hilliker failed to adhere to acceptable professional medical standards resulting in harm to Womer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Womer, acting through counsel, obviously believed that providing Hilliker with the expert report not only met the intent and spirit of Pa.R.C.P. 1042.3 and its requirement that a COM be filed, but exceeded that intent and spirit by furnishing not just a certificate that an expert report could be produced, but the report itself. As noted in the Superior Court’s opinion, the recent promulgation of Pa.R.C.P. 1042.3 provided scant guidance regarding the applicability of the doctrine of substantial compliance to the COM requirement, making these assumptions all the more reasonable. Under these circumstances, I find Womer’s belief that he had essentially complied with the COM requirement by forwarding the actual expert report to Hilliker within sixty days of filing the complaint a reasonable explanation and legitimate excuse for his actions, sufficient to open the judgment of <em>non pros </em>under Pa.R.C.P. 3051.</p>

The next day, immediately upon receiving notice of the judgment of <em>non pros, </em>Womer filed a motion to open the judgment in accord with Pa.

Accordingly, this is not a case where a party disregarded the rule’s requirements. Rather, not only did Womer substantially comply with the COM requirement, but within hours of being put on notice that he mistakenly did not meet all the technical requirements of the rule, he moved to rectify that mistake and supplied the technically missing COM.</p>

The Superior Court refused to find that where an attorney who forgets that the COM is due or who fails to take the steps to file it when faced with a family crisis is so derelict in his obligations that the oversight should not be excused. In support of this position, the Superior Court properly articulated the view that the law “is not so cold hearted as to demand vigilance of an attorney who experiences a death in the family or is so cold as to be unwilling to excuse failure under these circumstances.” <em><a href="/a2d/881/0861-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="881 A.2d 861" data-case-ids="8923952" data-case-paths="/a2d/881/0861-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/881/0861-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="881 A.2d 861" data-case-ids="8923952" data-case-paths="/a2d/881/0861-01">at 866</a>.

There, exactly 20 days after filing a Praecipe for Rule to File Complaint upon the plaintiff, Defendant praeciped for and obtained a judgment of <em>non pros. </em>The next day, immediately upon receiving notice of the taking of judgment, the plaintiff filed a petition to open asserting that the delay was caused by counsel’s secretary’s confusion and mistake. The trial court denied the petition, and the Superior Court affirmed. This Court reversed, finding that the request to open a judgment of <em>non pros </em>is directed to the conscience of the court and required the balancing of equities supportive of the entry of judgment and the opening thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 1358. We then opined that “[a] court reviewing denial of a petition to open judgment by default must ascertain whether there are present any equitable considerations in the factual posture of the case which require that it grant to a plaintiff against whom the judgment has been entered an opportunity to have his ‘day in court’ and to have the cause decided upon the merits. In so doing, it acts as a court of conscience.” <em>Id. </em>at 1360.</p>

Sadly, a plaintiff entitled to his day in court is being denied that opportunity, and a conscientious attorney who made an understandable, reasonable, and, importantly, wholly non-prejudicial mistake, finds his client out of court.</p>
