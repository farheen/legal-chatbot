On December 3, 1992, the Board filed a detainer with the New Jersey authorities in relation to this arrest. On April 29,1993, Calloway pled guilty to a reduced charge of Theft from a Person arising from the arrest for robbery in New Jersey. He was sentenced to serve a three-year sentence in a New Jersey state prison on May 21, 1993, (NJ Sentence), with credit for time served from October 15, 1992, (the date of arrest), to May 21, 1993, (the date of conviction for the theft charge).

On July 1, 1994, he was arrested by New Jersey authorities for violating his parole, but was released 18 days later without having his parole revoked. On October 7, 1994, New Jersey authorities again arrested him for violation of his New Jersey, parole, and this time he remained in official detention for four months and one day until February 8, 1995 (the recalculated date of expiry for the theft charge).</p>

The Board reasoned that none of this time served was for the original PA Sentence, and, consequently, Callo-way could not receive a credit towards that sentence.</p>

Also, if we held otherwise, it would result in the same time being counted against both Calloway’s PA Sentence and his County Sentence which, unless the sentences were ordered to run concurrently, is impermissible. Because his appeal rights have lapsed and cannot be revived under the guise of a mandamus action, and in any event, he is not entitled to credit for time while on constructive parole, Calloway has failed to state a claim for credit against his PA Sentence for the three months and 20 days incarcerated for the County Sentence.</p>

The Board contends that Calloway is also out of time to now claim New Jersey time for the same reason he could not challenge his County time — he had to appeal the 2002 Recalculation Order. What this position ignores is that unlike his County time, for which there has not been a change in the underlying facts, this claim only arose as a result of the 2004 New Jersey order vacating his original sentence of three years and re-sentencing Callo-way to time actually served from April 21, 1994, to February 8, 1995. What he is contending is that there is a non-discretionary duly on the part of the Board to credit that time.</p>

Moreover, <em>Martin </em>does not provide us with authority to apply time served in another sovereign as credit towards an obligation yet to be fulfilled in this Commonwealth.</p>
