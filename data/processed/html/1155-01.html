The officer stated that she then pulled Sladic over, whereupon she noticed he “smelled strongly of alcohol” and “seemed very disoriented.” Officer McRo-berts said that Sladic failed the sobriety tests she administered and that she asked him to submit to the intoxilyzer test. Although she was the arresting officer, Officer McRoberts testified that she did not read Sladic the implied consent warning. Instead, Officer McRoberts stated on cross-examination that she was present when Officer Gilbert Espy read Sladic the implied consent warning.

He said that Sladic “had several questions; I don’t recall about what.” Officer Espy further testified that “I asked him five times if he was willing to submit to the chemical test. The fifth time he said, I’m going to say (nein).” (N.T., Testimony of Officer Gilbert Espy, Hearing of May 12, 1993, pp. 8-9.)</p>

He testified that his windows had misted up, he had been wiping off his windshield, and then swerved to his right. He said that this malfunction caused him to inhale anti-freeze coming from the ventilation duets. He testified to his worry that the outcome of a breathalyzer test might be affected by his inhalation of anti-freeze. He stated, however, that despite the fact that he told the officers of his concern he was not offered any other type of chemical test, such as a blood test, but was marked a refusal. He also testified on cross-examination that he had had only two beers that evening. (N.T., Testimony of Michael John Sladic, Hearing of May 12, 1993, pp. 11-15.)</p>
