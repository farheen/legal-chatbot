The area in dispute was 2.1 acres from which defendant had removed trees, topsoil and 70,481 cubic yards of gravel. The locus of the westerly bound of this parcel was the critical fact to be determined. It must be conceded that a title search was ineffective to locate this line and, therefore, other evidence was properly admitted as bearing on that issue. It would serve no useful purpose to outline in detail the testimony offered in proof of the plaintiffs’ theory. In summary, the jury was justified in placing the disputed line 320 rods (5280 feet, or one mile) from and parallel to the so-called head of the “old Town Lots.” There was no dispute as to where the head of the old Town Lots was on the face of the earth, an established monument traceable back to the late 1600s. The jury could reject the defendant’s argument that an abutter’s deed, containing a fifty-two rod call, should be followed to arrive at the disputed boundary.
