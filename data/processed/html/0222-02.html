In this case the defendant, Estate of George A. Wigginton, deceased, Ruth Alice Young, Administratrix, appeals from a Superior Court order denying her motions to vacate or stay the enforcement of a civil judgment entered in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.</p>

The court is of the opinion that a District of Columbia Court that had personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction in a case for two years would not lose that jurisdiction on the death of decedent.</p>

    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[1009,255,749,181]]]'>For these reasons the defendant’s appeal is denied and dismissed, the order appealed from is affirmed and the papers of the case are remanded to the Superior Court.</p>
