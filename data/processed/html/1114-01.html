By providing that the license “will be held in safekeeping for the benefit of the licensee and <em>he available for his use when operations are resumed at the licensed premises, </em>or for transfer,” (emphasis added) shows that under this regulation, a license is not subject to being cited under the Liquor Code. By stating that the license is only available for use when operations are resumed, that language conversely indicates that when the license is held in safekeeping, the <em>operations </em>for which a liquor license is issued have, for all intents and purposes, ceased. Because it only is available for use and not in use, Operator is not subject to being charged with any violation of the Liquor Code.</p>

      <em>Berresford </em>is not a “safekeeping” case. It is a case where a licensee’s license was seized pursuant to a writ, not a situation where, as here, the licensee placed its license in safekeeping/or <em>its own benefit </em>until it later chose either to re-activate it or ultimately to transfer it. While it is true that in both cases, a licensee could be cited for selling alcoholic beverages, the licensee with its license in safekeeping retains benefits that are not available to the licensee with its license subject to a writ. Again, the safekeeping regulation was promulgated for the benefit of the licensee. 40 Pa.Code § 7.31.</p>
