The first offense was committed on November 2,1988. He committed the second offense on May 21, 1991. He was convicted (by guilty plea) of both offenses on October 11, 1991. He was sentenced for both offenses on November 26, 1991. As to the second offense, the Commonwealth sought application of the provision of 18 Pa. C.S. § 7508(a)(3)(i) which requires imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence “if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense: three years in prison and $10,000_” The sentencing judge held that the enhanced sentence was not mandated because the conviction for the first offense (October 11, 1991) did not occur until after commission of the second offense (May 21,1991) and accordingly imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment and a $5000 fine.</p>

All of the cases cited by appellant utilized the “recidivist philosophy” to construe recidivist sentence enhancement statutes which were ambiguous as to whether a prior conviction must have preceded <em>commission </em>of the second offense or whether the prior conviction merely must have preceded <em>sentencing </em>for the later offense. In other words, the philosophy is a valid tool in interpreting ambiguous statutory language.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[193,792,749,415]]]'>The “recidivist philosophy,” however, is not a constitutional principle or mandate, and the legislature is therefore free to reject or replace it when enacting recidivist sentencing legislation.

It says that “if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense,” he must receive an enhanced sentence. Appellant asks that we interpret the word “sentencing” in the statute to mean “committing the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced,” so that the statute would read, “if, at the time of committing the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense,” he must receive an enhanced sentence.

The first is based on the anomaly that on December 19, 1990, the sentencing statute was amended. The effective date of the amendment fell between appellant’s two offenses. At the time of appellant’s first offense, the statute provided at 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508(a)(3)(i): “Upon the first conviction ...: one year in prison and a fine of Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars ... and, upon the conviction for another offense subject to sentencing under this section: three years in prison and Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars_” This section, without the clearly contrary language contained in the amended version discussed above, has been interpreted to require <em>conviction </em>of the prior offense before the <em>commission </em>of the second offense in order for the enhanced sentence to attach. <em>Commonwealth v. Kane, <a href="/pa-super/430/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="430 Pa. Super. 203" data-case-ids="936434" data-case-paths="/pa-super/430/0203-01">supra;</a> Commonwealth v.

He argues that an enhanced <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>sentence for the second offense, as the Superior Court has ordered, based on the amended version of the statute, constitutes an <em>ex post facto </em>application of the amended statute.
