Waldheim, 1464122, was cited by the examiner in his notice of rejection of the claims, but not in his statement upon appeal, nor was it cited by the board in its decision. Waldheim, 1615894, so far as appears from the record before us, was cited for the first time by the Board of Appeals in its decision affirming the action of the examiner in rejecting the claims. The board in said decision made Waldheim, 1616071, the basic reference. No mention is made in the decision of Waldheim, 1464122, and Waldheim, 1615894, was cited only upon a minor question, in connection with another citation to the same point.</p>

As to the new claim proposed by appellant it declined to approve its admission, stating that it was not certain that the proposed claim was patentably distinguished from the combination of references suggested in its former decision, and that in any event the claim had not been submitted to the examiner, who was the office expert in this art, and hence it had not had the benefit of his views as to the patentability of the claim.</p>

    <p id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.7",204,[216,1130,1320,83]]]'>Two principal questions of law are urged by appellant for the reversal of the decision of the board:</p>
    <blockquote id="b204-7" data-blocks='[["BL_204.8",204,[213,1249,1321,114]]]'>1. That the Waldheim patents, Nos. 1616071, 1615894, and 1464122, were not proper references, because they were eopending, when issued, with appellant’s application.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b204-8" data-blocks='[["BL_204.9",204,[213,1375,1320,73]]]'>2. That appellant’s claim had not been twice rejected by the examiner with the Waldheim patents as a reference.</blockquote>
    <p id="b204-9" data-blocks='[["BL_204.10",204,[212,1473,1320,392]]]'>As to the first of appellant’s contentions, it appears that the application upon which the Waldheim patent, 1616071, was issued was filed on July 7, 1921, and the application in Ño. 1615894 was filed July 6, 1921, whereas appellant’s application was filed on December 3, 1921. Both of these Waldheim patents were issued on February 1, 1927. As to Waldheim, 1464122, as we have already observed, this patent was not referred to by the examiner in his statement or by the board in its decision.</p>
    <p id="b204-10" data-blocks='[["BL_204.11",204,[208,1873,1319,492]]]'>It was held in the case of <em>Alexander Milburn Company </em>v. <em>Davis-Bournonville </em>Company, <a href="/us/270/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="270 U.S. 390" data-case-ids="6140742" data-case-paths="/us/270/0390-01">270 U. S. 390</a>, that where a patent application fully and adequately disclosed, but did not claim, the thing patented, to a later applicant alleging a later date of invention, the later applicant was not the “ first inventor ” within Revised Statutes, section 4920. In that case, as in this, both applications were pending when the earlier patent was issued and it establishes the rule that the mere fact that applications are copending does not preclude the use of a patent issued upon the earlier application as a reference in the rejection of the later application.</p>
    <p id="b205-2" data-blocks='[["BL_205.3",205,[115,232,1320,500]]]'>
      <a id="p755" href="#p755" data-label="755" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*755</a>If appellant had made any claim that his invention was in fact prior to that of Waldheim, an interference could have been declared, in so far as Waldheim had made claims based upon his specification; or if his specification disclosed the invention covered by appellant’s claims, appellant could, by complying with rule 75 of the Patent Office, showing prior invention by him, have prevented the use of the Waldheim patent as a bar to a patent to him. This appellant did not do, and it must be assumed upon the record before us that appellant was not the first inventor of anything disclosed by the Waldheim patent.</p>
    <p id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[118,737,1318,287]]]'>The appellant’s second contention is that his claims had not been twice rejected by the examiner citing the Waldheim patent as a reference, and for that reason the Board of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain and apply said patent as a reference. He bases this contention upon section 4909 of the Revised Statutes, 85 U. S. C. A. sec. 57. This section reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[121,1057,1317,242]]]'>Appeals; from primary examiners to examiners in chief. Every applicant for a patent or for tlie reissue of a patent, any of the claims of which have been twice rejected, and every party to an interference, may appeal from the decision of the primary examiner, or of the examiner in charge of interferences in such case, to the board of examiners in chief; having once paid the fee for such appeal.</blockquote>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[117,1325,1320,1097]],["BL_206.1",206,[223,233,1319,185]]]'>The fact is that the five claims here in question had been twice rejected by the primary examiner, and the appeal wag taken from his second rejection. The statute makes no requirement that the grounds of rejection shall be stated. The rules of the Patent Office do require the reasons for the rejection to be fully and precisely stated, rule 65. This was done by the examiner. This rule further states that upon the rejection.of an application for want of novelty, “ the examiner must cite the best references at his command.” It appears from the record that the final rejection by the primary examiner occurred on April 2, 1926. As has already been stated, the Waldheim patents, Ros. 1616071 and 1615894, were issued February 1,1927, upon applications filed prior to the application of appellant. Appellant did not take his appeal to the board until March 3, 1927, which was after the issue of the Waldheim patents. In the examiner’s statement in response to said appeal, dated March 23, 1927, as required by the rules of the Patent Office, the examiner cited as an additional referencé Waldheim patent, 1616071. This was the first opportunity that he had to do so. Though not otherwise appearing in the record, the decision of the board states that appeallant’s attention was called to this new reference when, he received the examiner’s statement, and we must therefore assume that appellant did receive a copy of the examiner’s statement. It further appears <a id="p756" href="#p756" data-label="756" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*756</a>from the decision of the board that appellant objected to the citation of the Waldheim patent, but it nowhere appears that he asked that the matter be remanded to the primary examiner for a reconsideration of his claims in view of the Waldheim citation.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[220,433,1323,348]]]'>The rules and practices of the Patent Office provide for the protection of the applicant in such cases. Appellant did not choose to avail himself of the opportunity that the rules provided to have' secured a reconsideration by the primary examiner, and he must be held to have waived such reconsideration. In any event, the failure of the primary examiner to cite references is not a jurisdictional defect preventing their later use as references on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[218,787,1318,194]]]'>It would be a strange situation indeed if the failure of the primary examiner to cite a reference which would bar the issue of a patent would compel the issue of a patent which would be clearly invalid. No such construction of the patent laws is warranted.</p>

    <p id="b206-8" data-blocks='[["BL_206.8",206,[214,1250,1317,235]]]'>These questions of law being disposed of, there remains the question of whether the Board of Appeals erred in holding that there was want of invention by appellant, in view of the references cited.
