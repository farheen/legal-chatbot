This court is satisfied that the Defendant’s testimony before the jury clearly establishes not only a lack of remorse, but a lack of susceptibility to rehabilitation. Moreover, the Court notes that the Defendant has prior summary convictions in double figures. The Court has chosen therefore to sentence within the aggravated range.</blockquote>
