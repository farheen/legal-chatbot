This opportunity to correct alleged errors ... advances the orderly and efficient use of our judicial resources. First, appellate courts will not be required to expend time and energy reviewing points on which no trial ruling has been made. Second, the trial court may promptly correct the asserted error. With the issue properly presented, the trial court is more likely to reach a satisfactory result, thus obviating the need for appellate review on this issue.

But the precedent can have no force in light of the clear and unambiguous language of Rule 3051. As noted above, that rule <em>mandates </em>the filing of the petition in the trial court. The Comment to the Rule reinforces that unambiguous meaning, while also making clear that the Rule was designed to effect a change in the law previously adopted in the Superior Court, and reflected in <em>Valley Peat. </em>We cannot simply ignore the language of the Rule, and the occasion for its existence, in favor of equities that appel-lees would prefer we balance. The Superi- or Court cases upon which Appellees rely address a pre-Rule 3051 scenario, and cannot stand in face of the Rule itself. Furthermore, as noted above, the rule serves a salutory, essential purpose.</p>

Appellant also suggests that the Superior Court erred in not quashing the appeal below for failure to file a Rule 3051 petition. Quashal is usually appropriate where the order below was unappealable, <em>see Toll v. Toll, </em><a href="/pa-super/293/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="293 Pa.

Frost, </em><a href="/pa/465/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="465 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1712675" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0187-01">465 Pa. 187</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="465 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1712675" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0187-01">348 A.2d 418</a> (1975), or the Court otherwise lacked jurisdiction, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P.1972. Rule 1972(7) also permits, as a disposition without reaching the merits, a party to move to quash "for any other reasons on the record.” Quashal is not proper here. Clearly, a judgment of <em>non pros </em>dismissed with prejudice is a final, appealable order because it fully disposes of the case. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(1) (“A final order is any order that: disposes of all claims and of all parties[.]”). Moreover, the appeal was timely filed, the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the appeal, and appellant does not articulate any other ground for quashal under Rule 1972(7). Accordingly, we conclude that quashal is inappropriate; the proper consequence of the failure to file a Rule 3051 petition is a waiver of the substantive claims that would be raised.</p>
