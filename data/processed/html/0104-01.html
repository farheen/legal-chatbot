Bollinger asked Trivitt to step out of his car and perform three field sobriety tests. Trivitt failed all three tests. Trivitt subsequently consented to a blood alcohol test, which revealed a blood alcohol level of .15%. Consequently, Trivitt was charged with DUI.</p>
    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[174,571,753,797]]]'>Trivitt filed an omnibus pre-trial motion alleging that the roadblock conducted on August 14, 1992 through August 15, 1992 was unconstitutional and, therefore, any evidence obtained from the stop must be suppressed. Specifically, Trivitt questioned the constitutionality of the procedure by which the checkpoint was chosen. A hearing on Trivitt’s motion was held on March 24, 1993. The testimony at the hearing revealed the following. Corporal Mark Bentzel of the Northern York County Regional Police Department (NYCRP) was the supervisor of the DUI checkpoint in question. Corporal Bent-zel was trained in sobriety checkpoints in 1991 and had participated in two previous checkpoints.</p>
    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[176,1390,753,892]]]'>Corporal Bentzel testified that Wayne Harper, Director of the Center for Highway Safety in York County, presented him with a few roadway locations from which to choose the site of the sobriety checkpoint. These areas, Corporal Bentzel stated, were chosen due to their high incidents of DUI accidents and DUI arrests. Corporal Bentzel found that the safest location in which to set up the checkpoint was the section of Route 74 between the city of York and Davidsburg Road. He opined that this area would reflect a higher incidence of DUI because of its “higher volume of traffic.” The location was approved by both the York County Center of Highway Safety and the NYCRP and, prior to August 14, 1992, the public was given general notice that a DUI checkpoint would be conducted at that site.</p>

Mr. Harper attested that the roadways he suggested were chosen based upon local DUI statistics available to him. Specifically, he indicated that his roadblock location suggestions were based on a five-year study conducted by the Bureau of Highway Safety and Traffic Engineering in the York County area. When asked whether the study served to narrow the areas of high DUI occurrences, Mr. Harper answered in the affirmative. He also indicated that the study revealed that the area in question was one of the fifteen highest in DUI incidents in York County.</p>

How many DUI-related accidents occurred on this road in 1991? How may DUI arrests on this section of the road were made in 1992? How many accidents in 1992 were alcohol-related on this section of the road? Mr. Harper indicated that he did not have this information in front of him and, consequently, could not provide answers.</p>

Generally, hearsay is inadmissible as evidence because the competency and veracity of the original speaker (or writing) are not subject to examination. <em>Commonwealth v. Underwood, </em><a href="/pa-super/347/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="347 Pa. Super. 256" data-case-ids="643095" data-case-paths="/pa-super/347/0256-01">347 Pa.Super. 256</a>, 259, <a href="/pa-super/347/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="347 Pa.

The underlying rationale for the hearsay rule is that hearsay is too untrustworthy to be considered by the trier of fact. <em>Bujanowski, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="418 Pa. Super. 163" data-case-ids="916874" data-case-paths="/pa-super/418/0163-01">418 Pa.Super. at 167</a>, <a href="/pa-super/418/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="418 Pa. Super. 163" data-case-ids="916874" data-case-paths="/pa-super/418/0163-01">613 A.2d at 1229</a>. “The principle reason for excluding hearsay is the danger that the declarant’s credibility cannot be assessed.” <em>Bujanowski, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="418 Pa.

By analogy, consistent with the foregoing authority is the general rule that an expert<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> may not state a conclusion which is based on evidence not in the record. <em>Commonwealth v.

In response to Trivitt’s first issue, Corporal Bentzel's testimony regarding the roadblock location's high traffic volume is certainly not, in and of itself, sufficient to meet the <em>Tarbert </em>guidelines, which require the selected location to "likely ... be travelled by intoxicated drivers.” Importantly, however, we must consider the hearing testimony in its entirety in determining whether the Commonwealth has met its burden under <em>Tarbert. </em>To this end, it is necessary to also examine and evaluate Mr. Harper's testimony which, at least arguably, goes beyond the location’s high traffic volume.</p>

While Mr. Harper was not qualified as an expert in the traditional sense, in Pennsylvania, a liberal standard for the qualification of an expert prevails.
