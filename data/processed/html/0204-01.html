(“Unfoldment”) petitions for review of two orders of the District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board (“CAB”) relating to Unfoldment’s contract with the District of Columbia Child and Family Services Agency (“CFSA”) for the provision of residential foster care services to children. Unfoldment in essence argues that the CAB improperly dismissed, or in the alternative, granted summary judgment on certain of its claims, especially its claims that CFSA breached its contract by fading to pay Unfoldment for the stated minimum quantity of placements required under its indefinite quantity contract. We hold that Unfoldment’s contract with CFSA consisted not only of the articles of the contract, but also several other documents, including the Request for Proposal (“RFP”), which were incorporated into and made part of Unfoldment’s contract. Because the CAB did not construe the total contract, it erred by concluding that the contract contained no minimum placement requirement. Therefore, we reverse the CAB’s decision with respect to its dismissal of Unfoldment’s breach of contract and bad faith claims relating to the minimum placement requirement of the contract, and remand this case for further proceedings on those specific claims. However, we affirm the CAB’s decisions regarding Unfoldment’s other claims.</p>

CFSA initially maintained that Article XXV of the document applies only to the resolution of inconsistencies in the contract (but later appeared to agree that its initial interpretation was not accurate). Article XXV embodies two independent thoughts, separated by a period. One thought, which is clear from the plain language of the first sentence, is that the contract is to consist not only of the Articles of the contract, but also of six other specifically mentioned documents. The second thought, also clear from the plain language of the second sentence of Article XXV, is that if any inconsistency is found in the provisions of the contract, it is to be resolved by reference to the listed documents, in the order in which they are listed. Paragraph 3 of the Standard Contract Provisions is consistent with our interpretation of Article XXV. In reverse order, when compared with Article XXV, the first sentence of Paragraph 3 introduces the thought that inconsistencies are to be resolved by examining four identified documents in the order listed. The second sentence of Paragraph 3 lists a number of materials, including the “Bid/Request for Proposal” and plainly states that the listed materials “and documents referred to in any of [them], shall constitute the formal contract between the bidder/offeror and the District....” The language of both Article XXV of the contract and Paragraph 3 of the incorporated Standard Contract Provisions is unambiguous, and we conclude that “a reasonable person in the position of [Unfoldment and CFSA] would have thought,” <em>Independence Mgmt., Co., supra, </em><a href="/a2d/874/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="874 A.2d 862" data-case-ids="8956643" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0862-01">874 A.2d at 868</a>, that Article XXV contains two independent statements — (1) other documents are to be incorporated into and hence made part of the contract, and (2) if there are inconsistencies in the contract provisions, they are to be resolved by examining certain documents in the order in which they are listed in Article XXV. In short, the contract between Un-foldment and CFSA consists not only of the Articles of the contract, but a number of other documents, including the RFP, which must be consulted to determine whether the contract called for the District to place a minimum number of children with Unfoldment. To interpret Article XXV otherwise would “import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity.” <em><a href="/a2d/874/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="874 A.2d 862" data-case-ids="8956643" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0862-01">Id.</a> </em>(citation omitted).</p>

Unfoldment claims that “the Contracting Officer determined that CFSA ... terminated the contract at its convenience,” and therefore, “awarded Unfoldment ‘partial’ convenience termination costs.” Unfoldment faults the CAB for “striking the Contracting Officer’s ruling from the record.” We agree with the CAB that Unfoldment has misconstrued the Contracting Officer’s letter. Although the letter related to “termination of Unfoldment’s contract,” the word “termination” as used does not mean the same as the term of art, “termination for convenience.” As the CAB asserted, the Contracting Officer “does not use the words ‘termination for convenience’ or ‘default termination,’ terms of art in government contracts, but simply the word ‘termination’ which in standard speech simply means ‘conclusion’ ” according to Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1985 ed. Moreover, as CFSA argues, since Article XXII of Unfoldment’s contract addresses “termination for default or convenience,” the Contracting Officer surely would have referred to that article of the contract, specified whether the termination was for default or convenience, and indicated “the extent of termination and the effective date,” as required by Article XXII. He did not.

As the CAB found, Unfoldment’s contract provisions describe the contract as a one-year contract. <em>See </em>Article XVI of the contract. And, the two bilateral modifications of the contract (one exercising the contract option by extending the contract from July 1, 1998 through September 30, 1998, and the other from October 1, 1998 through October 31, 1998) did not turn the contract into a multi-year contract.

The CAB recognized that CFSA had a responsibility to remove its case files from Unfoldment’s property and directed CFSA to do so “within one month of the date of [its] decision” in this case.
