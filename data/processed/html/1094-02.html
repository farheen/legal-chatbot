He raises several issues in this appeal, only two of which merit more than conelusory discussion. McLeod argues that his conviction should be overturned because (1) the United States Attorney failed to refer the matter to the Director of Social Services as an intrafamily offense, pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-1002; and (2) the prosecutor’s questions during cross-examination required one witness to comment on the veracity of previous witnesses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

(It is inconceivable, for example, that an intrafamily first degree murder case would be dealt with civilly rather than criminally.) However, the statute does not establish different treatment for different categories of offenses. Additionally, § 16-1002(b) provides that the United States Attorney may consult with the Director concerning conditions of release in any ease in which a criminal prosecution is initiated. Hence, unless and until Congress speaks to the contrary, we can only conclude that notification must be given to the Director in all intrafamily cases, although we recognize such notification may be a rather perfunctory act.</blockquote>

Asking the witness on the stand whether another witnesses’s testimony is “accurate” is equivalent to asking the witness whether the other witness was lying or mistaken. Therefore, this line of questioning is impermissible. We urge that litigants in this jurisdiction desist from attempting to find “nice” distinctions between phrasings which we have already explicitly condemned and those we have not yet explicitly condemned. What is prohibited is seeking to have one witness comment or opine on the credibility of a prior witness, however phrased. In the circumstances of this case, we find the error harmless. The government’s case was a strong one; the improper questions were on somewhat peripheral issues; and, finally, the court instructed the jury that they were the sole judges of witness credibility. <em>See (Phillip) Dyson v.
