Upon arriving at the bar, the officers discovered Bartee lying on the ground directly behind a 1996 Chevrolet Suburban with a gunshot wound to his head. N.T., 10/03/2003 at 96. A spent shell casing was also found laying close to this same vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 168. While being interviewed by the police in the hospital, Bartee admitted to possessing the keys to the 1996 Chevrolet Suburban and that he regularly drove and operated this vehicle. Affidavit of Probable Cause, 11/01/2002, ¶ 16. Meanwhile, at the scene, one of the witnesses informed the officers that she had earlier seen Bartee holding a gun. Affidavit of Probable Cause, 11/01/2002, ¶ 11. The witness’s observation was later confirmed by Bartee who admitted to one of the officers that he, too, had a gun, and in fact had pointed it at Anthony Reynolds, the person suspected of shooting Bartee. <em>Id., </em>¶ 12. Thereafter, based on the suspected criminal activity of aggravated assault and simple assault, Officer Anderson applied for, and obtained, a search warrant for the 1996 Chevrolet Suburban.</p>

Roth, was presented with an application for a search warrant, supported by an affidavit of probable cause, to search a 1996 Chevrolet Suburban, which Bartee admitted to driving that evening. Affidavit of Probable Cause, 11/01/2002, at 4. Additionally, Bartee was found, lying on the ground near the Chevy Suburban with a gunshot wound to his head. <em>Id. </em>at 5. At the time the officers applied for the search warrant, the officers were investigating possible charges assault against Bartee based upon his admission that he both possessed a gun and pointed it at Anthony Reynolds, the individual suspected of shooting Bartee. <em>Id. </em>at 1, 3. Based upon the above information contained in the affidavit of probable cause, the magistrate determined that probable cause existed to search the vehicle and issued the search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 1. The suppression court agreed and as a result, denied Bartee’s motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the search. N.T. Suppression Hearing, 10/02/2003, at 45. The contents of the search warrant, which included Bar-tee’s admissions set forth above, and evidence of his recent use and possession of both the vehicle and a firearm, provided a reasonable basis upon which the issuing authority could have made a commonsense decision that there was a probability of criminal activity afoot. We agree that probable cause existed to support the issuance of this search warrant.</p>

Because that search warrant was constitutionally valid, the seizure of the drugs is constitutionally valid as the police came upon these items inadvertently, in a place where they had a legal right to be at the time of the discovery and the incriminating nature of the objects was blatantly obvious. Upon discovery of the drugs, however, the police exercised the utmost caution and obtained a second search warrant which specifically listed drugs among the items for which to search.
