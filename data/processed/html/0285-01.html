The inability to do so in a scientific way is attributable to a variety of factors. The question for the court is how to allocate the economic risks associated with these inherent uncertainties. In other words, what does May need to do to meet her burden of submitting a “good faith estimate” of her claim for indemnification.</p>
    <p id="b320-14" data-blocks='[["BL_320.12",320,[1007,491,753,1002]]]'>First, the time records in this case were not kept in a way that permits easy segregation of time spent on the successful issue from time spent on losing issues.

Bigmar’s approach is limited to time that was expressly dedicated to the “quorum” subissue. This would result in a very small recovery for May. The court is satisfied that given the policy of the state favoring indemnification of officers and directors,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a> May’s approach of identifying time and expenses to be excluded, rather than insist on specific identification of items to be included, is an acceptable methodology.</p>

Here, for example, May won the meeting issue but that victory was itself a mixed bag of subissues of various degrees of merit-some addressed by the court and some not.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_26" id="ref_footnote_1_26">26</a> There should be, no indemnification for losing issues, including subparts of a “winning” issue as to which the trial made specific negative findings. Nevertheless, other “subissues” that are not addressed by the trial court are properly within the scope of partial indemnification. Here, Bigmar argues that May should only be indemnified for time devoted to arguments the court found dispositive of whether the meeting was validly held and not the arguments the court explicitly did not address. This approach is unreasonable and unworkable. Carried to the extreme, it would make it necessary for courts to consider all issues presented, even those not necessary in deciding the case, or else risk disadvantaging a winning party in the subsequent indemnification claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_27" id="ref_footnote_1_27">27</a> Thus, the court defines the meeting issue broadly and excludes only those arguments expressly rejected by the court as insubstantial.</p>

She also sought a determination that the written consents executed on November 28, 2001 removing five of Bigmar’s nine directors (the "Tramontana Directors”) and Messrs.

They also argued that May’s November 28 written consents were legally ineffective because she lacked the authority to vote most of the shares represented by those consents. The third Section 225 action was filed by Banca del Gottardo, a Swiss bank, to confirm the validity of the two million shares issued to it at the November 16-18 meeting and the appointment of two bank nominees, Messrs.

Bigmar now attempts to reargue several issues pertaining to the plaintiff’s right to indemnification; namely, the fact that May was a plaintiff instead of a defendant would bar eligibility for indemnification, and that since her victory was a ‘hollow one' that she is not entitled to any indemnification. Former Vice Chancellor Jacobs’s summary judgment order clearly dictates that the next stage of the case is a determination of what fees are allocable to the plaintiff based on her success and whether those fees are reasonable. May asserts that whether she was successful in defense of the meeting claim is precluded by the "law of the case” doctrine. The court agrees and will not allow this issue to be relitigated. The "law of the case” doctrine requires that issues already decided by the same court should be adopted without reliti-gation, and “once a matter has been addressed in a procedurally appropriate way by a court, it is generally held to be the law of that case and will not be disturbed by that court unless compelling reason to do so appears.” <em>Odyssey Partners v.
