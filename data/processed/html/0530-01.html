    <p id="b598-24" data-blocks='[["BL_598.23",598,[1005,1193,752,1327]]]'>In October 1985, the right leg of plaintiff’s decedent, Blondell Brown, who was suffering from diabetes, was amputated below the knee. Subsequently, Ms. Brown sought redress for her injury by filing an action for negligence<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> against appellant R. &amp; G. Orthopedic Appliances and Prosthet-ics, Inc. (R. &amp; G.), a supplier of orthopedic shoes, and Howard University (Howard), which operates Howard University Hospital. The essence of Ms. Brown’s claim against R. &amp; G. was that, in fitting her with a pair of orthopedic shoes prescribed by a Howard podiatrist, this defendant had failed to follow the directions of the podiatrist with respect to the material to be used. Ms. Brown contended that R. &amp; G.’s negligence had caused blistering on her right foot and that gangrene had developed, so that amputation was the only recourse. Ms. Brown further claimed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that Howard committed malpractice by negligently failing to detect the seriousness of the condition allegedly caused by R. &amp; G.’s negligence and by not directing that she be hospitalized after she reported the blistering. R. &amp; G. and Howard filed cross-claims against one another.</p>

      <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>The case proceeded to a jury trial on November 29, 1988. On December 13, 1988, at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case, Ms. Brown reached a settlement with Howard. Under the terms of that settlement, Howard was to pay Ms. Brown $200,-000 in return for the dismissal of the action against Howard. Howard also dismissed its cross-claim against R. &amp; G. and participated in the trial no further. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict of $750,000 against R. &amp; G.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[187,825,751,850]]]'>On February 8, 1989, the trial judge, sitting without a jury, held a hearing on R. &amp; G.’s cross-claim against Howard for indemnity or, in the alternative, equitable apportionment or contribution. In conformity with the terms of the settlement agreement between Ms. Brown and Howard, which provided that Ms. Brown should be responsible for the defense and resolution of any remaining claims which R. &amp; G. might have against Howard, Howard was represented in this phase of the case by Ms. Brown’s counsel. On May 27, 1989, the trial judge issued a written order in which he denied R. &amp; G.’s claim for indemnity but granted R. &amp; G. contribution in the amount of $375,000, or one half of the jury’s award.</p>

First, R. &amp; G. maintains that the judge improperly declined to permit it to call Dr. Mark Ber-man as an impeachment witness, and thus prevented it from completing the impeachment of Dr. Patricia Schultz, a Howard University podiatrist who testified on behalf of Ms. Brown. Second, R. &amp; G. argues that the judge abused his discretion when he denied its motion to amend its witness list to add a different Howard University expert, Dr. E. Dalton McGlamry, who had given certain testimony favorable to it in a videotaped <em>“de bene esse </em>” deposition which was taken for use at trial. R. &amp; G. also contends that the trial judge erred in refusing to sustain its claim for indemnity-</p>

    <p id="b599-12" data-blocks='[["BL_599.12",599,[986,1213,752,700]]]'>As a result of her diabetic condition, which was compounded by cigarette smoking, Ms. Brown suffered from circulatory problems which caused recurring ulcers on her feet. In 1980 or 1981, Ms. Brown came under the care of Dr. Schultz at the Howard University Podiatric Clinic. In 1983, Ms. Brown was hospitalized for gangrenous changes on four of her toes, one of which had to be amputated. She developed osteomyelitis<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> in the three remaining affected toes, a condition which put her entire leg at risk. For the time being, however, Ms. Brown was successfully treated with antibiotics.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b599-13" data-blocks='[["BL_599.13",599,[986,1942,752,466]],["BL_600.1",600,[212,233,749,319]]]'>In February 1984, Dr. Schultz recommended to Ms. Brown that she obtain custom-molded shoes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Ms. Brown received an appropriate referral form and voucher, and was directed to Charlotte Gottlieb, a supplier of such shoes. Ms. Brown declined to obtain these shoes at this time, however, because she considered them “ugly.” On June 14, 1984, she suffered a fracture of one of the bones in her feet. On July 19, <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>1984, Ms. Brown’s feet were found to have new ulcerations and infections which were apparently caused by pressure points from the shoes which she was wearing. It was suggested once again that Ms. Brown obtain molded shoes, but at this time she did not do so.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[209,582,751,754]]]'>In April 1985, Ms. Brown used a hot water bottle against medical advice in order to warm her feet. After examining Ms. Brown, Dr. Schultz repeated her recommendation that she obtain molded shoes. Dr. Schultz gave Ms. Brown a voucher which would enable her to secure them. Dr. Schultz testified that she suggested two alternative suppliers of such shoes, one being Charlotte Gottlieb and the other being R. &amp; G. Dr. Schultz had used Charlotte Gottlieb’s services for four years, but had not previously ordered orthopedic shoes from R. &amp; G. She prepared prescriptions for Ms. Brown to present to each of these suppliers.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[205,1358,754,947]],["BL_600.6",600,[1012,232,747,183]]]'>There was considerable and conflicting expert testimony regarding the proper composition of the molded inserts for the shoes prescribed for Ms. Brown. Dr. Schultz and the experts called by Ms. Brown<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> testified that the only appropriate insole material for a diabetic person was “plastizote,” a very soft, spongy material. On the other hand, Dr. John Senatore, an expert in podiatry called by R. &amp; G., testified that use of plastizote was not required by the applicable standard of care, and that a more rigid material was appropriate for the insole, provided that it was properly molded. Dr. McGlamry, an expert witness for Howard, also stated in his deposition that the use of plastizote was not required. According to Dr. McGlamry, plastizote is softer and more yielding than other materials and initially molds better to the contours of the foot, but it also has a tendency to “bottom out” after a few months and provides “less protection than if you had something more substantial.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b600-9" data-blocks='[["BL_600.9",600,[1010,448,748,567]]]'>Dr. Schultz testified that it was always her intention that Ms. Brown’s insole would be constructed of plastizote. Although, she did not so specify on the Charlotte Gottlieb prescription, she asserted that “most’likely” she wrote plastizote on the prescription directed to R. &amp; G. She also stated that she telephoned R. &amp; G. and orally specified that the insoles should be made of plastizote. She was unable to recall, however, to which of two R. &amp; G. representatives she conveyed this direction.</p>
    <p id="b600-10" data-blocks='[["BL_600.10",600,[1007,1047,751,796]]]'>After some delay, the custom-molded shoes were furnished to Ms. Brown on July 3,1985. Ms. Brown testified that she complained to Jeannette Flynt, the orthotist<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> assisting her at R. &amp; G., that the shoes were uncomfortable. Ms. Flynt testified, to the contrary, that Ms. Brown made no such complaint. It is undisputed that Ms. Flynt advised Ms. Brown to wear the shoes for progressively longer periods each day. Ms. Brown testified that she wore the shoes for approximately an hour and one half on the first day she had them, and for approximately forty-five minutes on the following day. She then noticed blisters on her right foot and stopped wearing the shoes.</p>
    <p id="b600-11" data-blocks='[["BL_600.11",600,[1007,1882,746,421]],["BL_601.1",601,[202,229,748,80]]]'>On July 9,1985, on a regularly scheduled visit to the Howard University Podiatry Clinic, Ms. Brown told Dr. Schultz about the blistering which had apparently been caused by the molded shoes. Dr. Schultz renewed an antibiotic medication which Ms. Brown had been taking, surgically removed some dead tissue, drained Ms. Brown’s abscesses and, according to the entry on the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>clinical records, “referred [the patient] back to the shoe lab.”</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[200,337,750,794]]]'>Ms. Brown next returned to the clinic on July 16, at which time Dr. Schultz found some healing, but also noted “persistent ulcerations” in several of Ms. Brown’s toes. Dr. Schultz testified that she first saw the molded shoes on the occasion of Ms. Brown’s July 16 visit to the clinic, and realized then that the “orthosis” portion of the shoes was made of a hard rubber substance, rather than of plastizote. She stated that she had “a very sharp visceral reaction,” that she was “stunned,” and that she “could feel [her] body clinch up.” She attributed these reactions to her realization that the shoes were made of a substance which she had not anticipated and which, in her view, was harmful to Ms. Brown.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[199,1154,751,457]]]'>Dr. Schultz did not direct, during July, that Ms. Brown be admitted to the hospital as an inpatient.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> She testified that on July 16, 1985, she directed Ms. Brown to return to R. &amp; G. to have her shoes adjusted or replaced. Ms. Brown made no further visit to R. &amp; G., however, and no adjustment was made to the shoes. Meanwhile, on July 17,1985, Dr. Schultz left for her vacation.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[198,1639,750,748]]]'>On August 6, 1985 Ms. Brown was admitted to Howard University Hospital for antibiotic therapy and bed rest. She was discharged on August 19th after she refused to continue the prescribed treatment. Outpatient treatment, consisting of cleaning and dressing Ms. Brown’s foot, was continued during the remainder of August and early September, when she was readmitted to the hospital for exploratory surgery. After that surgery v/as performed, Ms. Brown again left the hospital against medical advice. By the time that she returned on October 16th, her right foot had become gangrenous. Her right leg was amputated below the knee on October 17th.</p>
    <p id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.7",601,[197,2408,749,181]],["BL_601.8",601,[997,228,753,1570]]]'>At trial, R. &amp; G. vigorously contested not only Ms. Brown’s allegation that it was negligent, but also her contention that its conduct was a proximate cause of the loss of Ms. Brown’s foot and lower leg. On the issue of negligence, R. &amp; G. challenged Dr. Schultz’s claim that she had directed that plastizote be used for Ms. Brown’s orthopedic shoes. R. &amp; G. relied on the testimony of Dr. Senatore (and also attempted to use the deposition of Dr. McGlamry) to counter the views of Dr. Schultz, Dr. Cavanaugh, and Dr. Miller that its failure to use plasti-zote was inappropriate in treating a diabetic patient. On the question of causation, R. &amp; G. offered the testimony of Dr. Barbara Douglas, a physician specializing in internal medicine, who testified <em>inter alia </em>that there were a number of factors which may have contributed to Ms. Brown’s loss of her leg, including the patient’s smoking and her use of a hot water bottle. According to Dr. Douglas, the need for amputation could not be attributed with a reasonable degree of medical certainty to R. &amp; G.’s conduct, or even to the ulceration of her toes, and Ms. Brown’s leg would ultimately have been amputated even if she had not worn the shoes provided to her by R. &amp; G. R. &amp; G. also relied on parts of the testimony of two of Ms. Brown’s experts, Dr. Miller and Dr. David Morowitz, each of whom indicated that the applicable standard of care required Ms. Brown’s hospitalization in light of her condition on July 9 and 16, 1985, and that if Howard had exercised due care, amputation could have been avoided.</p>

Following the injury, however, a physician negligently fails to clean the wound, which becomes infected and gangrenous, so that the plaintiff’s arm must be amputated.

The authorities cited by the court in <em>Juliano </em>have analyzed the issue as raising a question of indemnity.

Ms. Brown seeks to distinguish the authorities cited by R. &amp; G. upon the ground that, in some of them, the claim for indemnity was made in a separate suit. We find this distinction unpersuasive; a claim for indemnity made early in the process should not receive less favorable treatment than one made later.</p>
      <p id="b614-7" data-blocks='[["BL_614.8",614,[235,1252,724,556]]]'>Ms. Brown points out that in the present case, the jury has already determined that R. &amp; G.’s negligence proximately caused her injuries. This is true, and leads to the eminently fair result that, as between Ms. Brown and R. &amp; G., the loss should be borne by R. &amp; G., as the party which the jury found to be negligent. Nevertheless, as between the two negligent parties — R. &amp; G. and Howard — that defendant who could and should have prevented the deterioration of the patient’s condition must indemnify that defendant whose role in the infliction of that part of the injury was far more remote. That, we think, is the teaching of the authorities discussed in this opinion.</p>
      <p id="b614-8" data-blocks='[["BL_614.9",614,[237,1813,721,475]]]'>Ms. Brown also argues that in the present case, the actions of R. &amp; G. and Howard were "directly interrelated from the start of the plaintiffs problems." Assuming without deciding that this statement is correct, it provides no solace to Ms. Brown. According to the judge’s findings in the text of his order, Howard could have avoided amputation of Ms. Brown’s foot at a time when R. &amp; G. no longer had any connection with her treatment. If the actions of the two defendants were closely connected at an earlier time, they were not so interrelated at the critical time.</p>

Lest our decision be misconstrued, we are not holding that every physician who negligently fails to stem the harm done by an injury inflicted by an initial tortfeasor is always required to indemnify the earlier wrongdoer. Indemnity is an equitable doctrine, and each case must turn on its own circumstances. In the present instance, however, Howard’s role in the treatment of Ms. Brown predated R. &amp; G.’s and resumed shortly after the orthopedic shoes were prescribed. Howard had a great deal more to do with the patient than R. &amp; G. did. According to the judge’s findings in the text of his order, the expansion by Howard of the relatively less devastating injury inflicted by R. &amp; G. into a drastic one requiring amputation would have been avoided by the exercise of due care. Finally, the injury suffered by Ms. Brown is readily divisible into the harm suffered prior to Howard’s failure to hospitalize her and the more drastic later consequences, including amputation. We have no occasion to decide whether the same result would follow in the absence of some of these factors.</p>

R. &amp; G. makes a persuasive case, however, for the proposition that the evidence tends to contradict those findings. Indeed, R. &amp; G. makes a plausible argument for the proposition that any finding that amputation would have been necessary, irrespective of what Howard did, would be clearly erroneous.</p>
      <p id="b614-16" data-blocks='[["BL_614.16",614,[1037,1909,717,365]]]'>Dr. Morowitz and Dr. Miller both testified rather unequivocally on behalf of the plaintiff that due care on the part of Howard would have saved Ms. Brown’s foot. Ms. Brown relies primarily on the testimony of Dr. Schultz, who stated that Ms. Brown’s ulcers became very aggressive and never healed. This is a far cry, however, from a showing that timely hospitalization and treatment could not have healed them.</p>
      <p id="b614-17" data-blocks='[["BL_614.17",614,[1035,2285,717,437]]]'>Ms. Brown also argues that Dr. Morowitz wavered in his opinion that Ms. Brown’s leg could have been saved, stating on one occasion that expeditious treatment <em>“probably </em>” would not have resulted in the avalanche of events that terminated in amputation.” This statement by Dr. Morowitz reflects his view that Howard’s negligence “probably” and not "certainly" worsened Ms. Brown’s condition. We think that Dr. Morowitz’ comment is a slim reed upon which to attempt to rest a finding that the foot could not have been saved.</p>
