Perhaps it is for this reason, the fact that the invention lies in relatively virgin territory, that it has been so difficult for us to ascertain the precise grounds relied upon by the Patent Office to support its rejections. After much study of the record, we have determined that the rejections are based on 35 USC 101 and <em>35 </em>USC 112. In particular, there is a rejection of all claims for <em>failure to prove </em>utility, under section 101; a rejection of all claims for <em>failure to disclose how to malee and use the </em>invention, under section 112; and a rejection of all claims on the ground that they <em>fail to define the invention </em>with the particularity and distinctness required by section 112.

The mere fact that the claimed invention may have possible utility in vivo does not warrant disregard of in vitro activity where the claims are not limited to in vivo use. See <em>In re Folkers, </em><a href="/ccpa/52-2/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="52 C.C.P.A. 1269" data-case-ids="12165208" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/1269-01">52 CCPA 1269</a>, <a href="/ccpa/52-2/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="344 F.2d 970" data-case-ids="12165208,869463" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/1269-01,/f2d/344/0970-01">344 F. 2d 970</a>, <a href="/ccpa/52-2/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="52 C.C.P.A. 1269" data-case-ids="12165208" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/1269-01">145 USPQ, 390</a>.

In order to obtain good yields of Interferon adequate oxygenation of the cell material or tissue is necessary during incubation, which is carried out in a buffered salt solution, for example Earles’ solution (see R. O. Parker, “Methods of Tissue Culture”, 1950). This incubation is carried out, most advantageously at blood heat, for a relatively longer period, for example overnight, and the Interferon is <a id="p1797" href="#p1797" data-label="1797" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1797</a>spontaneously liberated into the medium. With heat-inactivated virus the bulk of the Interferon is liberated between 3 and 12 hours after commencing incubation, but with ultra-violet inactivated virus liberation may continue for 2 or 3 days.</blockquote>

Ammonium sulphate carried into the buffer solution may then be removed therefrom by dialysis.</blockquote>

The utility here disclosed is anti-viral activity in a “subject” or <em>in vivo </em>as a substitute for a vaccine.
