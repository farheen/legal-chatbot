Because we conclude that a beneficiary’s interest in a revocable inter vivos trust is contingent at most, we hold that, generally, these beneficiaries lack standing to challenge the settlor’s lifetime amendments. Instead, to challenge the settlor’s capacity to make amendments, revocable inter vivos trust beneficiaries must follow the procedures set forth in Nevada’s guardianship statutes, NRS Chapter 159. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of the underlying complaint challenging revocable inter vivos trust amendments.</p>

    <p id="b623-11" data-blocks='[["BL_623.11",623,[189,1423,1132,450]]]'>Appellants Ernette and Myrna Linthicum are the brother and sister-in-law, respectively, of Claire Linthicum-Cobb. In 2002, Cobb executed a will and a revocable inter vivos trust. As settlor, Cobb named herself trustee and reserved the power to revoke or amend the trust throughout her lifetime without having to notify any beneficiary. Cobb named Ernette and Myrna the primary beneficiaries of the trust upon Cobb’s death. Additionally, Cobb named Ernette and Myrna successor trustees upon Cobb’s death or incapacity. Finally, the trust stated that the trust would become irrevocable upon Cobb’s death.</p>
    <p id="b623-12" data-blocks='[["BL_623.12",623,[190,1879,1132,353]]]'>In 2004, Cobb executed a new will and a restatement/ amendment to the trust. The amended trust replaced Ernette and Myrna as successor trustees with respondent Arnold Rudi, the nephew of Cobb’s deceased husband. Also, the amended trust allegedly named Rudi as the sole beneficiary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Under the amended trust, Cobb remained the current trustee and retained the power to revoke the trust. Thus, the amended trust was still a revocable inter vivos trust.</p>
    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.3",624,[231,274,1133,356]]]'>
      <a id="p1454" href="#p1454" data-label="1454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1454</a>After Cobb named Rudi the sole successor trustee, Rudi and Guardianship Services of Nevada petitioned for co-guardianship of Cobb’s person and estate because Cobb was possibly delusional and paranoid. Ernette and Myrna objected to Rudi’s appointment as a co-guardian; Rudi’s petition for guardianship was later withdrawn. The district court granted Guardianship Services’ petition for guardianship because it found that some of Cobb’s actions had resulted in self-neglect and potential self-harm.</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.4",624,[229,636,1132,269]]]'>Subsequently, Ernette and Myrna filed a complaint alleging that the amended trust was a product of incapacity and/or undue influence, and they sought a constructive trust and/or cancellation of the amended trust. As to undue influence, Ernette and Myrna alleged that Rudi had a confidential relationship with Cobb and participated in executing the amended trust.</p>
    <p id="b624-6" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[229,911,1131,393]]]'>Rudi filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, under NRCP 12(b)(5), asserting that Ernette and Myrna had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because they lacked standing to challenge the amended trust. Specifically, Rudi argued that a will contest cannot be maintained until the testator dies, and since Cobb was still alive at the time, Ernette and Myrna lacked a present legal interest in the will and the trust. Rudi also argued that Ernette and Myrna could not assert any damages resulting from the amended trust.</p>
    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[228,1320,1131,488]]]'>Ernette and Myrna simultaneously filed an opposition to Rudi’s motion to dismiss and a motion for the appointment of themselves as guardians ad litem. Ernette and Myrna argued that they had standing because the amended trust was presently operative and effectual. Moreover, they argued that even if they could not challenge Cobb’s will until after her death, it was necessary to challenge the amended trust during Cobb’s lifetime to ensure that her wishes for the administration of her estate were observed while she was incapacitated. Finally, if the court concluded that they did not have standing, they asked that they be appointed as guardians ad litem.</p>
    <p id="b624-8" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[226,1823,1132,404]]]'>The district court granted Rudi’s motion to dismiss, without prejudice, finding that Ernette and Myrna lacked standing to challenge the amended living trust because Cobb was still alive; the court also denied Ernette and Myrna’s motion to be appointed guardians ad litem. In denying a subsequent rehearing motion, the district court explained that Ernette’s and Myrna’s interest was at best contingent and would only vest if they survived Cobb. The district court also granted Rudi’s motion for attorney fees and costs. Ernette and Myrna appealed.</p>

Specifically, Ernette and Myrna argue that NRS 164.015, NRS 153.031(l)(a) and NRS 153.031(l)(d) allow interested persons to challenge the validity of a revocable trust while the settlor is still alive.

However, neither of these statutes directly addresses revocable inter vivos trusts, such as the trust in this case. Moreover, these statutes specifically refer to petitions by interested persons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Because the trust at issue is a revocable inter vivos trust and Cobb retained the ability to revoke the trust during her lifetime, Ernette and Myrna have at most a contingent interest that has not yet vested.

In a case from Ohio, <em>Lewis v. Star Bank, N.A., Butler County, </em>the beneficiaries of a revocable inter vivos trust sued the trustee for an alleged breach of fiduciary duty for failing to give pre-death tax and estate-planning advice to the settlor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Ohio Court of Appeals determined that while the settlor was alive, pursuant to the terms of the trust itself, she had reserved the right to modify or revoke the trust.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The court further concluded that as long as the settlor had that right and other “indicia of retained ownership” during her lifetime, the beneficiaries did not have an absolute entitlement to any portion of the trust while the settlor was alive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Since the beneficiaries’ interests <a id="p1456" href="#p1456" data-label="1456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1456</a>were subject to complete divestment while the settlor was alive, the court held that the beneficiaries were not in privity with the sett-lor or the trustee and could not maintain their lawsuit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

For these reasons, we conclude that Ernette and Myrna lack standing to challenge Cobb’s revocable inter vivos trust while Cobb is still alive.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[182,768,1132,636]]]'>After filing their complaint, Ernette and Myrna requested that the district court appoint them as Cobb’s guardians ad litem, under NRS Chapter 159, so that they could prosecute an action against Rudi and the trust on Cobb’s behalf. For Ernette and Myrna to serve as Cobb’s guardians ad litem under these circumstances— namely, in a matter in which they challenge Cobb’s actions in amending her trust to exclude themselves as beneficiaries — would create a conflict of interest. Accordingly, the district court properly denied their request.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> To the extent that Ernette and Myrna’s concerns center on Cobb’s capacity, those concerns are more appropriately addressed under Nevada’s guardianship statutes, NRS Chapter 159, in the separate action brought under those statutes, rather than through their appointment as guardians ad litem in the litigation against Cobb’s trust.</p>
