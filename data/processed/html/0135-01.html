We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[214,853,753,734]]]'>•Berry was originally sentenced in 1992 to a term of imprisonment of one and one-half years to seven years on two counts of delivery of a controlled substance. By order of the Board dated August 30, 1993, Berry was paroled to an approved plan that required him to report regularly to parole supervision staff, to stay within his parole district and not to change his residence without written permission of the parole supervision staff.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Additionally, the Board imposed a special condition on Berry’s parole requiring him to submit to urinalysis testing. Berry, however, failed to abide by these conditions.</p>
    <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[209,1611,755,587]]]'>By order of the Board dated February 17, 1994, Berry was declared delinquent effective October 26, 1993. On April 27, 1994, the Duquesne Police Department arrested Berry on charges of criminal homicide. The Board thereafter issued an order dated August 29,1994, detaining Berry pending disposition of these criminal charges. However, these charges were later dropped after the Duquesne Police Department discovered that Berry’s brother, and not Berry, committed the homicide.</p>
    <p id="b170-8" data-blocks='[["BL_170.8",170,[210,2222,750,289]],["BL_170.9",170,[1018,254,749,393]]]'>Nevertheless, by order of the Board dated April 5, 1995, Berry was recommitted as a technical parole violator to serve twelve months backtime for failing to report to parole supervision staff, failing to submit to urinalysis testing, failing to report his arrest, traveling outside the parole district without permission and changing his residence without permission. Berry’s parole violation maximum sentence date was recalculated to September 16, 1999. Berry served his backtime and was paroled a second time on May 10, 1995, under the same conditions as his first parole.</p>
    <p id="b170-11" data-blocks='[["BL_170.11",170,[1014,687,751,844]]]'>Berry, however, again failed to abide by these conditions. Specifically, Berry failed to report to parole supervision staff and failed to submit to urinalysis testing. Hence, the Board issued an order dated May 24, 1995, declaring Berry delinquent effective May 22, 1995. Berry was subsequently recommitted as a technical parole violator to serve twenty-four months back-time as a result of his violations of these conditions. Berry’s parole violation maximum sentence date was recalculated to November 8, 1999. Berry applied for parole in July of 1997, but was refused by the Board as a result of his need for counseling and treatment and his multiple misconducts during recommitment.</p>

Berry was subject to conditions similar to those of his first and second paroles. Once again, Berry failed to abide by these conditions and he was declared delinquent effective June 22, 1998, by order of the Board dated August 6, 1998. On September 17, 1998, Berry was arrested again by the Duquesne Police Department on charges of terroristic threats, simple assault and firearms violations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On the same day, the Board issued a warrant to commit and detain Berry. On September 24, 1998, Berry was arrested once more by the Duquesne Police Department on charges of reckless driving, fleeing and eluding police and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. At a preliminary hearing, these charges were held <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>over for the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

On July 8, 1999, Berry pled nolo contendré to the aforementioned charges of reckless driving, fleeing and eluding police and driving under suspension. Berry was sentenced to time served (four months) plus twenty months probation. He received credit from September 24,1998, to January 24,1999.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[133,1008,751,974]]]'>Berry was returned to the State Correctional Institution at Frackville (SCI-Frackville) after his sentencing on July 8, 1999. On July 27,1999, Berry requested a panel revocation hearing regarding his new conviction. A hearing was held at SCI-Frackville on September 17, 1999. Following the hearing, the Board issued an order dated November 29, 1999, recommitting Berry as both a technical and convicted parole violator to serve a total of twelve months baektime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Berry’s parole violation maximum sentence date was recalculated to March 25, 2001.

The Board noted that Berry did not post bail following the September 24, 1998, charges. The Board concluded, citing <em>Walker v.

The Board also concluded that, after adding the one year, eight months and seventeen days that Berry owed on his original sentence to July 8, 1999, when Berry was first held solely on the Board’s warrant, it properly recalculated Berry’s parole violation maximum sentence date to March 25, 2001.</p>

More specifically, Berry argues that since- his maximum term for the September 24, 1998, charges expired on January 24, 1999, any time he served subsequent to that date was served solely under the Board’s warrant. We disagree.</p>

We refuse to do so. In this case, Berry pled nolo contendere to charges of reckless driving, fleeing and eluding police and driving under suspension. Hence, Berry was “convicted” of these new charges. In addition, Berry was sentenced to time served (four months) plus twenty months probation as a result of this conviction. As Berry was “convicted” of these new charges and a new “sentence” was imposed, the exception as stated in <em>Gaito </em>and <em>Davidson </em>does not apply.
