By opinion dated March 30, 1978, the Board awarded claimant total disability benefits for time lost from work due to her back injury from September 17, 1976, to September 27, 1976; and from September 30, 1976, to February 3, 1977. Such benefits as were paid to claimant under the Delaware unemployment compensation statute between September 30, 1976, to February 3, 1977, were, however, offset from the Board’s award.</p>

Additionally, since Section 2361(a) bars “forever” such claims as fall outside the two year limit, the Board properly denied compensation for the period of June 27, 1977 to November 14, 1977. The testimony of the claimant, Dr. John Hogan and Dr. Constantine Michelle consistently attribute claimant’s loss of work during this later period to her neck condition.</p>

Bensinger, </em>Del.Super., 5176 C.A., 1971 (unreported opinion, J. Quillen, January 12, 1972), it was determined that unemployment insurance payments and workmen’s compensation benefits are not mutually exclusive remedies. Recovery of one does not bar recovery of the other. However, as indicated by Judge Christie in the case of <em>Phoenix Steel v. Trivits, </em>Del.Super., 511 C.A., 1977 (unreported opinion, J. Christie, March 9, 1978), while receipt of unemployment insurance benefits does not in and of itself disqualify one from receiving workmen’s compensation benefits, “. . . the amount of any disability award should be reduced by the unemployment benefits received.” This view recognizes that both workmen’s compensation and unemployment insurance are designed to replace a certain percentage of lost wages. Eligibility for benefits under more than one wage-loss statute does not entitle a claimant to increased benefits. A single loss of earnings should be compensated by only one recovery. “To the extent that any physical disability (compensated through workmen’s compensation) lasts longer than the economic unemployment (compensable under unemployment laws), the injured workman could continue to receive extended workmen’s compensation benefits without having prejudiced such right by the interim receipt of unemployment benefits; yet at no time may the claimant get duplicate benefits for the same period.” <em>Phoenix Steel Corporation v.
