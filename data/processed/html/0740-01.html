Tyson readily admitted to the slaying, but at some point claimed that he had acted in self-defense. Later, before his trial for killing Millner, Tyson <a id="p743" href="#p743" data-label="743" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*743</a>contacted <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>staff writer Mark Bowden and spoke with him on several occasions, providing Bowden with details of the shooting and of his clash with the dealers. Based on this information, Bowden authored a series of three articles for the <em>Inquirer </em>in which he explained the Commonwealth’s likely theory of vigilantism and Tyson’s claim of self-defense. <em>See generally </em>Mark Bowden, <em>Hero or Vigilante?

The court then commenced Tyson’s trial, first issuing preliminary instructions to the jury and then allowing attorneys for the Commonwealth and Tyson to present their opening statements. Meanwhile, the reporters were seeking a stay of the trial court’s order from the Superior Court, which issued a temporary stay on December 6, 2000 pending the Commonwealth’s response to the reporters’ motion. The trial court, having received word of the Superior Court’s stay order, halted Tyson’s trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The following day, the Superi- or Court entered an order dissolving the temporary stay effective December 8, 2000. Tyson’s trial then resumed, with the trial court proceeding to swear the jury and the Commonwealth presenting several of its witnesses as part of its case-in-chief. At the same time, Bowden and Washington were once again seeking a stay, this time from this Court. We issued a temporary stay order on December 11, 2000, but ultimately denied the reporters’ request on December 12, 2000.

As Bowden and Washington had exhausted all avenues of relief with regard to a stay of the trial court’s order, the court directed the reporters to comply with its December 4, 2000 order by 12:00 p.m. on the day of the hearing or be held in contempt of court.

Specifically, the trial court entered what it characterized as a coercive civil contempt citation: an order that “each [reporter] must pay $100 per minute starting 12:00 noon this date until compliance or until the Commonwealth finally rests its case on rebuttal [of Tyson’s defense].” <em>Commonwealth v.

Specifically, the court reasoned that the Commonwealth could not obtain Tyson’s statements from any source other than the reporters because only Tyson and the reporters were present at each interview, because the Commonwealth could not directly compel Tyson to produce the statements, and because Tyson would either not reveal the statements or not reveal them in an accurate manner on cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 332. In addition, the court found that the Commonwealth had demonstrated that Tyson’s statements were relevant because Tyson had claimed self-defense, making his statements about the shooting “directly relevant and crucial to countering his self-defense theory and impeaching his credibility.” <em>Id. </em>The court similarly concluded that Tyson’s statements were crucial to the Commonwealth’s case and its effort to counter Tyson’s defense because such statements would help the Commonwealth prove that [Tyson] shot the victim deliberately to help rid his neighborhood of drugs and gangs, rather than in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 332-33.</p>

While there may be some who would only share information with the media if the media enjoyed an absolute shield from any discovery in civil proceedings, providing an absolute shield could hardly be said to be necessary to effectuate the purpose of the Shield Law in light of the information that flows freely in states that have enacted more carefully-tailored shield laws and the considerable burden of proof imposed on a defamation plaintiff by the requirements of the First Amendment.

With respect to the first criterion, whether the Commonwealth has made an effort to obtain the information from other sources, we begin by pointing out that the number of potential sources for Tyson’s statements is necessarily limited to the two reporters and Tyson, as no other individuals were present during the interviews. Moreover, Tyson was not a viable source because the Commonwealth could not have forced him to produce the statements without running afoul of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against compelled self-incrimination. In addition, this conclusion is unchanged by the fact that Tyson waived his constitutional privilege by testifying in his own defense because, assuming that there were inconsistencies between his unpublished statements and the statements he made to <a id="p756" href="#p756" data-label="756" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*756</a>authorities, it is patently unreasonable to assume that Tyson, while under the stress of cross-examination, would have been able or willing to recount accurately the statements he made to Bowden and Washington in some instances over two years prior to trial. Instead, there is a real possibility that a criminal defendant in these circumstances might render a self-serving account of his statements in which he would deny all inconsistency, and the Commonwealth, left without the defendant’s actual statements to reporters, would lack a concrete means for confronting such testimony. Thus, Tyson is not an acceptable source for the information, not only because it is his own credibility that is at issue, but also because his statements, as they appear in the reporters’ notes, are by their very nature unique. As the Third Circuit has explained: <em>Cuthbertson I, </em><a href="/f2d/630/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="630 F.2d 139" data-case-ids="392558" data-case-paths="/f2d/630/0139-01">630 F.2d at 148</a>; <em>see Cuthbertson II, </em><a href="/f2d/651/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="651 F.2d 189" data-case-ids="1245212" data-case-paths="/f2d/651/0189-01">651 F.2d at 196</a> (same); <em>In re Grand Jury Empaneled Feb. 5, 1999, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/99/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="99 F.

Thus, this case turned on what the jury believed Tyson’s mental state was at the moment he fired his weapon. All of Tyson’s statements about the shooting, whether published or unpublished, would directly reflect this mental state, as they would manifest his version of how and why the events on the night of the shooting took place. Accordingly, Tyson’s statements about the shooting were plainly “relevant and important” to a determination of whether Tyson acted in self-defense. In addition, Tyson’s statements regarding his relationship with the local drug dealers are of identical import, as such statements would be of significant value to the jury in evaluating the veracity of the Commonwealth’s contention that Tyson killed Millner in an effort to rid his neighborhood of drugs. Finally, Tyson’s statements to Bowden and Washington, to the extent that they conflicted with his prior statements to the police, were also “relevant and important” because the Commonwealth could have used those statements to impeach Tyson’s credibility once he took the stand to proclaim that the shooting was in self-defense. <em>Cf.

It is this vital aspect of <em>Taylor </em>that leads us to reject the reporters’ contention that it should be read as interpreting the Shield Law as protecting non-confidential sources in addition to confidential sources.

Parenthetically, we note that the Commonwealth urges us to reject these three Third Circuit cases and construe <em>Branzburg </em>as not providing Bowden and Washington with any privilege whatsoever. We decline this invitation for several reasons. First, the Commonwealth did not make this argument to the trial court. Indeed, before the trial court, the parties’ confined their dispute to the proper interpretation of these Third Circuit cases. Moreover, because we ultimately conclude that the Commonwealth has made a showing sufficient to surmount the qualified privilege as recognized by the Third Circuit, <em>see infra </em>pp. 755-59, we need not reach the broader, thornier question of whether the Third Circuit properly interpreted <em>Branzburg </em>in recognizing the privilege. <em>See, e.g., Parsons v.

Most of the reporters' contentions with respect to the third criterion are undermined by their underlying reliance on a mistaken interpretation of the term “crucial.” <em>See supra </em>note 12. Even putting that error aside, however, the reporters’ assertion that it was inappropriate for the lower courts to make any assumptions regarding the importance of Tyson's unpublished statements is suspect given that any such determination was thwarted by the reporters’ refusal to produce the statements even for <em>in camera </em>review. <em>See </em>R.R. 24a-25a (Trial Vol. 1, Dec. 1, 2000, at 31-34). If, for example, Tyson had told either Bowden or Washington, "I purposefully shot Millner to rid my neighborhood of drugs,” that statement undoubtedly would have been “relevant and important” to the Commonwealth's case. <em>Cf. </em>R.R. 25a (Trial Vol. 1, Dec. 1, 2000, at 35) ("THE COURT: There is an allegation [Tyson] saw [Millner] with a gun but let’s say he told Mr. Bowden [’]I saw him with a knife,['] that is pretty crucial information to the Commonwealth.”). Indeed, such a stunning admission would have been “crucial” even in the sense that Bowden and Washington employ that term, as it could easily have persuaded the jury to find Tyson guilty of first-<a id="p759" href="#p759" data-label="759" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*759</a>degree murder rather than third-degree murder. On the other hand, if Tyson's statements had been completely innocuous and devoid of inconsistency, their "relevance and importance” would obviously have been diminished. Absent disclosure or <em>in camera </em>review, there was simply no way to make that determination. <em>Compare Doe I, </em><a href="/f-supp/853/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="853 F. Supp. 147" data-case-ids="7402945" data-case-paths="/f-supp/853/0147-01">853 F.Supp. at 149-50</a> (finding undisclosed statements to be "relevant evidentiary material” that must be submitted for <em>in camera </em>review), <em>with Doe v.

Additionally, we are also not persuaded by the reporters' repeated insistence that the Commonwealth’s failure to put Tyson’s published statements to significant use at trial undermines the need for Tyson’s statements, as the "relevance and importance” of those statements does not hinge on the use to which they are ultimately put by the Commonwealth.</p>

We also find noteworthy the apparent degree of caprice that infected the trial court’s decision-making process. For example, the court initially, and rather arbitrarily, suggested a $1,000 per hour sanction. <em>See </em>R.R. 385a (Trial Vol. 1, Dec. 13, 2000, at 93) ("I have not heard of [a sanction of $1,000 per hour until compliance] but I think that would be more helpful to the Court than just about anything.”). Moments later, however, the court changed its mind and decided on a $100 per minute sanction, the equivalent of a $6,000 per hour sanction, or six times the court’s originally suggested figure. <em>See </em>R.R. 387a (Trial Vol. 1, Dec. 13, 2000, at 102-03). Moreover, the court initially stated that the applicable time period would last for approximately one and one-half hours, thus resulting in a $9,000 sanction. <em>See </em>R.R. 387a (Trial Vol. 1, Dec. 13, 2000, at 102-03). However, the court then decided that the time period should be extended until the Commonwealth completed its rebuttal, which in the end entailed six and two-thirds hours of trial time, and consequently resulted in a $40,000 sanction. <em>See </em>R.R. 389a (Trial Vol. 1, Dec. 13, 2000, at 110-11). Thus, the trial court essentially increased the sanction from $1,500 ($1,000 per hour over one and one-half hours) to $40,000 ($100 per minute over six and two-thirds hours) without any apparent rationale for doing so. <em>See Shaffer, </em><a href="/a2d/712/0749-01" class="citation" data-index="220" data-cite="712 A.2d 749" data-case-ids="11818394,507802" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0749-01,/pa/551/0622-01">712 A.2d at 751</a> ("Discretion must be exercised on the foundation of reason, as opposed to ... caprice or arbitrary action.”); <em>United Parcel Serv., </em><a href="/pa/574/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="830 A.2d 941" data-case-ids="588038,9099127" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0304-01,/a2d/830/0941-01">830 A.2d at 948</a> (abuse of discretion committed where decision made in unreasoned framework).</p>
