Asserting the State failed to establish his custody in a penal institution pursuant to an arrest or court order, as the statute under which he was charged requires, Duquette argues the Superior Court erred in denying his motion to acquit. We affirm the judgment below, finding competent evidence in the record to support the conviction.</p>
    <p id="b1202-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1202.14",1202,[1032,438,752,1136]]]'>On June 7, 1983, a Penobscot County Grand Jury returned an indictment against Joseph Duquette charging that on or about May 17, 1983, while in custody in a penal institution pursuant to an arrest or court order, Duquette intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caused offensive physical contact or bodily injury to three corrections officers. At the trial, two prosecution witnesses testified as to the defendant’s custodial status on May 17, 1983, the date of the alleged assault. Michael Milliken, a corrections officer at Penobscot County Jail at the time of the alleged incident, testified that on May 17, 1983, Duquette was in jail awaiting trial, and had been in jail for at least four months. Bruce Curbett, Assistant General Administrator with the Penob-scot Sheriff’s Office at that time, testified over objection he was familiar with Du-quette’s custodial status on May 17, 1983, specifically, Duquette was in custody pursuant to a court order, having been unable to furnish bail.</p>
    <p id="b1202-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1202.15",1202,[1031,1606,747,615]]]'>At the close of all the evidence, the defendant, arguing the prosecution failed to show he was in custody at Penobscot County Jail pursuant to a court order, moved for a judgment of acquittal. Although acknowledging Curbett testified as to his custodial status, the defendant reasserted such testimony was not competent because it was based on hearsay. Stating, “I am satisfied there is probably a prima facie case made out,” the presiding justice denied the motion for acquittal. Duquette was convicted, and this appeal follows.</p>

It is apparent from the above-quoted provision that custody in a penal institution or facility pursuant to an arrest or court order is an essential element of the offense set forth, and as such, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. When an improper denial of a motion to acquit is alleged, this court must determine whether, in view of all the evidence in the case, there was legally sufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict. <em>State v. Millett, </em><a href="/a2d/392/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="392 A.2d 521" data-case-ids="8005006" data-case-paths="/a2d/392/0521-01">392 A.2d 521</a>, 523 (Me.1978); <em>State v.

In the specific context of this case, the question becomes whether the jury could find from the testimony of prosecution witnesses Milliken and Curbett that Joseph Duquette was in custody in Penobscot County Jail on May 17, 1983, pursuant to a court order.</p>
    <p id="b1203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1203.5",1203,[221,1309,749,649]]]'>The defendant asserts and we agree that the testimony of witness Milliken, standing alone, was not sufficient to establish custody pursuant to a court order. The propriety of the guilty verdict is therefore dependent on the admissibility of the testimony of Bruce Curbett. The defendant contends Curbett’s testimony in regard to the court order should not have been admitted, first, because Curbett lacked “first-hand knowledge” of such order, and second, because the testimony in regard to the order was inadmissible hearsay. We find merit in neither of these contentions.</p>

Although the prosecution did not lay a foundation for this knowledge, it may be reasonably inferred Curbett was familiar with the court order by virtue of his position as Assistant General Administrator for the Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office. The natural inference from Curbett’s statement that he was familiar with Duquette’s status is that he had personal knowledge. At trial, the defendant did not object to Cur-bett’s testimony on the basis of lack of personal knowledge. Such failure to object waives the laying of the foundation, if, in fact, the witness has personal knowledge. M.R.Evid. 602 adviser’s note; <em>see also </em>Field &amp; Murray, <em>Maine Evidence </em>§ 602.1, at 129 (1976). We are satisfied Curbett had such personal knowledge.</p>

Rather, the prosecution <a id="p1148" href="#p1148" data-label="1148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1148</a>sought only to show the <em>existence </em>of such order placing Duquette in custody.
