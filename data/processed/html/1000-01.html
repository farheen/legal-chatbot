The disclosure of the instant application is concerned with an insulating refractory plastic composition or lagging material adapted for plastic coating or jacketing of the outer surfaces of furnaces,, boilers, flues, pijjes, and other high temperature equipment.

The mode of production of the synthetic grog is described as. that of thoroughly premixing very finely divided carbonaceous particles (such as paper) with a high quality of fireclay, also finely divided, and with any other desired ingredient, adding water before-the mixing is completed. The material is then molded to the desired shape, and by drying it is “set.” It is first burned in the presence-of air to consume the carbon particles, leaving microscopic voids, and then it is finally burned at a high temperature in the usual manner of burning fireclay products. These products, when completed,, are crushed and pulverized to a fine powder and constitute the preferred grog of the present disclosure. With this grog, appellant uses-hydraulic cement, a quantity of finely divided, dried, unburned fire-clay, and an expanding agent, preferably aluminum powder, in small percentages. There is also included a proportion of asbestos-like-mineral matter in the form of fine fibers.</p>

After having so elected, he urged the allowance of the method claim 34 in the instant application. Both tribunals held that under such circumstances he was estopped from claiming claim 34 in the instant application.

On this phase of the case, it seems to us that the Patent Office passed upon the patentability of this claim merely as a matter of precaution, in view of the probability of appeal, and that it was not necessary for the board to have passed upon the prior art status of the claim. We are of the opinion that it is not necessary for us to pass upon the correctness of the conclusion of the board as to the unpatentability of claim 34 in view of the prior art, and that under such circumstances appellant’s fears relating to the issue of <em>res judicata </em>are groundless.</p>

    <p id="b324-7" data-blocks='[["BL_324.7",324,[255,901,1328,791]]]'>We see no merit in the contention that appellant’s application emphasizes the use of his composition as a lagging material, as distinguished from similar compositions used for the purposes disclosed by the references. To lag an article to retain its heat is to heat-jacket it; for: example, such an article as a steam cylinder. The definition of “lagging” includes the function of producing a non-conducting covering, as on a boiler. See Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary, 1942 Ed. Appellant’s lagging of a glass, oil cracking, or steel furnace, as far as the claims here involved are concerned, consists not necessarily in the manner in which it is applied, but in the character of the composition used. In view of the prior art it is thought not to be inventive to use the composition in making blocks for insulating or refractory purposes, and for the same reason it also seems obvious that it would not be inventive to use it by spreading it on the outer walls of a furnace. A case which seems to be particularly in point here is <em>Atlantic Works </em>v. Brady, <a href="/us/107/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 U.S. 192" data-case-ids="3499227" data-case-paths="/us/107/0192-01">107 U. S. 192</a>, 200.</p>
