The first incident began shortly before noon when Eugene Logan, a cab driver, picked up two men, later identified as appellants Lawson and Bittle, who asked to be taken to an address in Southeast Washington. As they neared, their destination, Lawson put a gun to Mr. Logan’s head, told him to pull the cab to the side of the road, and demanded all of his money. Once he complied, Lawson suggested to Bittle that they take him to a wooded area and kill him. However, when Bittle warned Lawson that another car was approaching, Lawson ordered Logan to drive on. A few moments later, Logan pulled his cab to the side of the road, where two women were standing. Logan pleaded with the men to leave the cab, but Lawson demanded that he drive on. When Logan refused, Lawson put the gun to the right side of Logan’s head and shot him. Mr. Logan fell out of the cab and made several attempts to get up. When he finally stood, he saw Bittle and Lawson driving off in his cab. Mr. Logan was taken to the hospital by a passing motorist.</p>

Lawson asked for a ride to another address in Southeast and Johnson agreed. All three men got into the van. Lawson seated himself directly behind Johnson, and, when Johnson missed a turn, stuck a gun in his side and announced that he was robbing him. Johnson pleaded that he had no money and Lawson ordered him out of the van. Clark and Lawson led Johnson toward a wooded area while Bittle stayed behind with Ms. Thomas. When the three men reached a dark spot approximately twenty-five yards from the van, Clark and Lawson took Johnson’s watch and two rings. Lawson then told Johnson that, because he had already done something like this and had been identified, he would have to shoot Johnson. He ordered Johnson onto his knees and hit him on the back of the head with the gun. Lawson and Clark dragged Johnson to a creek and rolled him in. Lawson then shot Johnson in the head. When Clark and Lawson left, Johnson got up and escaped in the opposite direction.</p>

For example, she carefully excised a reference to appellant Clark from a statement given by appellant Bittle and explicitly noted to the jury that certain evidence regarding the Logan offense was not applicable to appellant Clark. She was also meticulous in separating her instructions to the jury and had separate verdict forms prepared for each appellant. The record shows that the judge was most concerned that there be “no avenue left for confusion on the part of the jury in determining what charges apply to what Defendants.” Since the evidence was not confusing, we find that the trial judge was correct in deciding that the interests in judicial economy outweighed the potential prejudice to appellant Clark. Consequently, the denial of severance with respect to him was also proper.</p>
