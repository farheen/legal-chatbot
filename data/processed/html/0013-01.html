    <p id="b19-13" data-blocks='[["BL_19.17",19,[137,1198,1330,164]]]'>After a second trial on the merits, judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $44,989.00. The defendant now seeks appellate review of the very issue previously considered; namely, whether the doctrine of frustration of purpose is applicable to the facts of this case.</p>
    <p id="b19-14" data-blocks='[["BL_19.18",19,[137,1365,1334,535]]]'>The operative facts are simply stated. Robert E. Hague (“Hague”) negotiated and completed the purchase of the “Modern Key Shop,” a locksmith business owned by the plaintiff’s testator, Paul C. Copp (“Copp”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">2</a> On May, 10, 1988, in consideration for purchasing the “equipment, stock and goodwill” of Copp’s business, the defendant executed a promissory note in the amount of $67,000.00 payable in monthly installments of principal and interest (amortized over thirty years at ten [10%] percent) in the amount of $587.89. The parties also executed a written sale Agreement which provided for Copp’s sale to Hague, “or a Corporation to be formed and designated by him,” of all key shop equipment and inventory, including a Ford van, as well as Copp’s interest in the lease of the business premises and Copp’s promise not to compete for five years. The Agreement obligated the defendant to maintain a minimum inventory of $40,000.00, and granted Copp an interest therein as security for the promissory note.</p>
    <p id="b19-15" data-blocks='[["BL_19.19",19,[140,1904,1332,81]],["BL_20.1",20,[214,234,1332,285]]]'>The Agreement also provided that Copp would “continue to work at the business” for one year at a salary to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. Copp worked in the <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>key shop for only three months after the defendant!s purchase, but received no salary. The record is devoid of any explanation for the defendant's failure to compensate Copp or of the actual reason (s) for Copp’s departure. There was evidence at trial that the agreement for Copp to work in the key shop for one year until May 10,1989 at a salary to be determined was not part of the $67,000.00 consideration paid by the defendant for the business assets. The defendants tax return for the year of the sale in fact showed receipt of business assets in excess of $65,000.00.</p>
    <p id="b20-3" data-blocks='[["BL_20.4",20,[216,524,1330,196]]]'>The defendant made twenty-two monthly payments of $587.90 for a total of $12,933.58 on the promissory note from June 10, 1988 to March 10, 1990. Paul C. Copp died on March 28, 1990. The defendant made no further payments on the note subsequent to Copp’s death and, in fact, stopped payment on an April 10, 1990 check which had been tendered.</p>

On the contrary, the second <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>report clearly establishes that the defendant executed the $67,000.00 promissory note in question as consideration solely for the physical and legal assets of Copp’s business and for Copp’s agreement not to compete. Subsequent to both Copp’s departure from the business in August, 1988 and his death in March, 1990, and indeed throughout the ensuing five year period, the defendant has continued successfully to operate the business which has generated revenues well in excess of the purchase price.</p>
