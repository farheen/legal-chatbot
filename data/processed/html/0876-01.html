He does, however, challenge his other two judgments of conviction. First, he alleges that the State failed to prove that the degree of force used by Gronen-thal was sufficient to establish the offense of Attempted Murder. Second, Gronen-thal argues that the Superior Court should have granted his motion for acquittal as to the charge of Kidnapping in the First Degree. According to Gronenthal, the evidence failed to establish, and the Superior Court failed to determine, as a matter of law, that the restraint employed by Gro-nenthal to commit the sexual offenses was substantially greater than normally incident to the underlying sexual offenses, which is a prerequisite to submission of the issue to the jury.</p>

Smith had been living with Gro-nenthal and his wife, Helen Gronenthal, for almost two years since shortly after the death of Smith’s mother. Helen had invited Smith to stay with her and her family after Smith could no longer stay with a sister.</p>

On the night of December 31, 1997, Smith had <a id="p878" href="#p878" data-label="878" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*878</a>fallen asleep on top of her bed after returning home about 2 a.m. from a party. She awoke to find Gronenthal standing over her, having removed her glasses from her face. Gronenthal claimed that her alarm had gone off and that he had come in to turn it off. Smith went downstairs to get a drink only to find Gronenthal had also gone down and he was staring at her. As she was going back up to her room, Gronenthal blocked her way and asked if he could kiss her. Smith avoided him and returned to her room without further incident.</p>

Jones had spent the night and Smith drove her home to change before the shopping expedition. When she returned from dropping off Jones, Smith noticed that Gronenthal was home, although Helen and her son were not. Smith went to the kitchen and made herself a sandwich. Gronenthal came into the kitchen and tried to make conversation, which Smith found was unusual. She also felt that he was staring at her.</p>

Gronenthal told Smith he needed to have sex with her and straddled her on the bed. After talking to her for a few seconds, Gronenthal sat up and let Smith sit next to him on the bed. She tried to talk to him, but Gronenthal said that he had to go through with it now because she would tell on him. He asked her to take off her shirt and then her bra. Smith complied but continued to try to talk him out of continuing his assault. Gronenthal allowed her to replace her bra after he had stared at her for a while.</p>

After some time, Gronenthal removed the pillow from Smith’s face and asked her to take off her shorts. After she removed her shorts, Gronenthal started to choke her again. Smith pleaded with him, saying that she was not ready to see her mom and claiming that her brother was on his way over to see her. Gronen-thal continued to strangle her and periodically place the pillow over her face.</p>

After awhile, Jones left without having heard anything, assuming that something had come up and that Smith would call Jones later. Gronenthal continued to strangle Smith, saying that he had to kill her “because it was too late.” At this point, Smith determined that she could no longer fight off Gronenthal and that a better strategy would be to “play dead.” During this time, Smith heard <a id="p879" href="#p879" data-label="879" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*879</a>Helen return to the house and her son came to the door, knocking and asking for the portable phone.

Seeing an opportunity to escape, Smith leapt from the bed, but before she could reach the door Gronenthal grabbed her and threw her down on the bed. Gronenthal strangled Smith for the third time longer and harder than either previous time. He put the pillow back on her face. Smith felt like she was blacking out. She felt numbness in her arms and legs and she lost control of her bodily functions. Smith remembered the “death rattle” from when her mother had died and decided to make similar noises hoping to convince Gronen-thal that she was really dead this time.</p>

He also bound her feet with something. During this time, Gronenthal talked about having killed Smith. He periodically checked Smith’s pulse and under nose to see if she was still breathing. Smith held her breath whenever he did this. After unsuccessfully attempting vaginal intercourse, Gronenthal placed his penis in Smith’s mouth. Gro-nenthal told her he had killed her and that he was going to go jump off a bridge now. Gronenthal grabbed Smith one more time and squeezed her body with his arms and legs. He then covered her body with a blanket. Gronenthal put his robe back on and left the room.</p>

She grabbed a t-shirt and climbed out the window. She ran along the roof of townhouses to her neighbor’s house. She pushed in a window fan and climbed into her neighbor’s house. After telling the neighbor to lock all the doors, Smith called Jones’s mother and told her what had happened. Smith saw Gronenthal drive away. Eventually, Jones and Jones’s mother arrived at the neighbor’s house.</p>
