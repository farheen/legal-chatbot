However, recourse to appellant’s specification indicates that the “high styrene resin” is a resin such as PLIOLITE S-6B (an 85% styrene-15% butadiene copolymer). The application states that the high styrene resin reinforces the chloroprene polymer and adds hardness. Furthermore, there is a statement that the high styrene resin is a thermoplastic resin and is not vulcanized in the finished composition. Thus, we are apparently not faced with the problem of unpredictability due to chemical reactions. Several other high styrenes are named and there is a statement that any high styrene suitable for rubber compounding may be used.</p>

In order to decide whether appellant has “overclaimed,” we must consider the invention as a whole and decide whether he has attempted to obtain protection beyond the reasonable scope of the invention he has disclosed. In making this determination, both appellant’s disclosure and the prior art are pertinent. Both references relied upon by the board disclose rubbery compositions containing a resin. The Pebze specification states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b831-8" data-blocks='[["BL_831.8",831,[154,2269,1325,160]]]'>Resins which may be used, in addition to polystyrene and the resinous copolymers of styrene and butadiene shown in the examples, include phenol formaldehyde and resorcinol formaldehyde resins, resinous copolymers of butadiene and acry-lonitrile in which the acrylonitrile predominates, and acrylic acid copolymers.</blockquote>

Appellant’s specification taken with the prior art clearly indicates that the styrene resin component of his composition is conventional and that many equivalents are known to the art. Although some routine experimentation might be necessary to determine whether a particular styrene resin would perform adequately in the claimed composition, it would not be an unreasonable burden in view of the disclosure given by appellant of the considerations in choosing a resin and the indicated knowledge of the art. See <em>Minerals </em>Separation, <em>Ltd. </em>v.

In balancing appellant’s right to full protection of his invention against the danger of granting claims which will result in a monopoly of greater scope than the disclosure, we here hold in favor of the appellant and <em>reverse </em>the rejection based on 35 USC 112.</p>

In addition to the portion previously quoted, Petze discloses a specific rubbery composition containing 40.2 percent poly-chloroprene, 22.7 percent resinous copolymer of styrene and butadiene and 29.9 percent glass fiber flock. With regard to the ratio of poly-chloroprene to styrene resin, Petze states:</p>

However, we do not find persuasive appellant’s arguments that his product containing a different ratio of elastomer to resin is unobvious. Indeed, in view of the fact that we agreed with appellant’s arguments that the art would know what kind of “high styrene resin” to use in the composition, we think it would be inconsistent to hold that a composition having a slightly varying percentage of “high styrene resin” is unobvious.</blockquote>

We thus agree with the board as to the rejection of claims 1, 3, 13 and 14. Claim 5 calls for a mixture of hard and calcined clay but does not specify the amounts, and thus would not appear to be distinguishable from only one clay. Claims 19, 20, 21, 23 and 24 differ in that they are directed to a “molded and vulcanized article.” Claims 21 and 24 call for the presence of an accelerator, a vulcanizing agent and an anti-oxidant. We do not consider that these recitations render the claims unobvious over Petze which also discloses molding and vulcanizing compositions containing an accelerator, a vulcanizing agent and an anti-oxidant. Claim 20 specifies that the article have a “compression set of no greater than 70% after subjecttion to 30% compression at a temperature of 300° F. for 70 hours.” While we recognize that property to be the desirable result appellant claims to have achieved, we also note that he stated “if the mineral filler were to be composed wholly or substantially wholly of a hard clay * * *, the resulting vulcanized material would be too hard and would have a high compression * * *." We thus feel that little weight should be given the recitation in the claim.</p>

The solicitor admits that it should be allowed, and we agree. Claims 29 and 33 are process claims comprising the steps of forming the composition, molding and vulcanizing. We agree with the board that the steps of forming a rubbery composition, molding and vulcanizing are old.
