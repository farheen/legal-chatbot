    <p id="b710-4" data-blocks='[["BL_710.7",710,[197,496,754,742]]]'>In Count XII, Stilp avers that legislative leaders acknowledge the existence of legislative leadership accounts, that the balance is approximately $135,000,000 and that legislative leaders accumulated the balance by failing to return surplus appropriations at the end of each fiscal year. (Amended Petition, ¶¶ 143-145, Joint Appendix (Jt. App.) at 23a-24a.) Article VIII, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides as follows: “All surplus of operating funds at the end of the fiscal year shall be appropriated during the ensuing fiscal year by the General Assembly.” Pa. Const., art. VIII, § 14.</p>
    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.8",710,[197,1271,755,955]]]'>In answers and new matter, Respondents assert that, as of June 30, 2004, the Legislature has a “continuing appropriations” balance of $135,037,369, which does not lapse at the end of the fiscal year. (Respondents’ Answers, Jt. App. at 66a-67a, 70a-71a, 78a-79a, 80a-81a, 88a-89a, 90a-91a.) In support of their assertion, Respondents attached the General Appropriations Act of 2005<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> (Act) and an Ernst &amp; Young audit of legislative appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Section 2006(e) of the Act states that appropriations to the Legislature shall be “continuing appropriations.” (Jt. App. at 356a.) The audit shows that the Legislature has a “continuing appropriations” balance of $135,037,369 as of June 30, 2004. (Jt. App. at 377a.)</p>

Respondents refer this court to the Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1967-1968 for Wednesday, February 14, 1968. On that date, Delegate Woodring explained that the purpose of Article VIII, Section 14 was to change past practice relating to surpluses:</p>
    <blockquote id="b710-9" data-blocks='[["BL_710.11",710,[1040,746,711,398]]]'>Members of the Convention, this ... section is to ... change a situation. Heretofore ... surpluses had to be placed into the sinking fund, and now instead of that, there being no sinking fund — the sinking fund has been abolished — any surpluses will be put into the next fiscal year’s budget to dispose of it.</blockquote>
    <p id="Am0" data-blocks='[["BL_710.12",710,[998,1164,753,603]]]'>(Jt. App. at 408a.) Delegate Leonard explained his understanding of “surplus” as follows: “If there is any money left over at the end of the year from lapses that occur within the department or from revenues that were received in excess of that which was estimated, that would then become a surplus.” (Jt. App. at 408a) (emphasis added). Delegate O’Donnell provided further insight, stating that “uncommitted and unencumbered funds shall lapse.” (Jt. App. at 408a.)</p>
    <p id="b710-10" data-blocks='[["BL_710.13",710,[1000,1787,751,544]],["BL_711.1",711,[154,234,754,448]]]'>Stilp, in his brief to this court, concedes, “A continuing appropriation, in and of itself, seems harmless and not necessarily violative of the constitution.” (Stilp’s brief at 4) (emphasis added). Stilp elaborates, stating that “continuing appropriations” sound innocent, “[a]t least in theory. Whatever is not spent in the present fiscal year is continuously appropriated to the following fiscal year. So far, so good and consistent with the constitution.” <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>(Stilp’s brief at 4) (emphasis added). However, Stilp believes that the problem with “continuing appropriations” is that they give a few people unchecked access to millions of dollars that are not needed for the operation of the Legislature. Stilp states that people with control over so much money may use it for personal purposes rather than the people’s business.</p>
    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[156,705,753,799]]]'>Although we understand Stilp’s concern, the legal question before us here is a narrow one, i.e., whether “continuing appropriations” constitute “surplus” under Article VIII, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Ernst &amp; Young audit explains that “[continuing] appropriations unexpended at the end of an appropriation period are available in the subsequent appropriation period.” (Jt. App. at 380a.) Thus, “continuing appropriations” are committed and encumbered and do not lapse at the end of the fiscal year. Because of this, they cannot be “surplus” that is available for appropriation during the ensuing fiscal year.</p>
