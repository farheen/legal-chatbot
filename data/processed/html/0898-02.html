In early 2006, Appellant, then 35-years-of-age, was residing in a residential neighborhood in Haverford Township, Delaware County, where he had lived his entire life. Appellant was taking college classes at this time and working part time for a security firm. N.T. Trial, 9/26/2007, at 108, 128. On the morning of February 28, 2006, a cold and overcast day, two boys — ages 13 and 12 — who lived on an adjoining street to the one on which Appellant’s house was located, were walking from their homes, via the nearby thoroughfare of Manoa Road, to the middle school they attended. Both testified that, as they walked along this street, Appellant drove up beside them and offered them both a ride to school or to the local “WAWA” grocery store. N.T. Trial, 9/27/07, at 16, 37-39. This grocery store, the Haverford Township police station, public library, and middle school all were located nearby within a short distance of each other along Darby Road which intersects with Manoa Road. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 115-117.

Appellant testified that between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. that morning, he left home in his truck with the intention of getting coffee and breakfast at the WAWA grocery store before beginning a research project for his college public speaking class at the library. <em>Id. </em>at 108-109,115. As Appellant approached the heavily congested intersection of Naylor’s Run Road and Manoa Road, he recalled observing the two boys standing near the intersection, and, ac<a id="p901" href="#p901" data-label="901" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*901</a>cording to Appellant, because of their age and the fact they were carrying backpacks, he believed they were from his neighborhood and on their way to school. Appellant related that, because it had been raining, he offered them a ride to school, or, alternatively, at least as far as the grocery store at which he intended to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 112-113. In Appellant’s view, since he was going in the direction of the school anyway, he thought he was merely doing a “kind thing” by making the offer, and, since they all lived in the same neighborhood, he did not believe the boys’ parents would have objected. <em>Id. </em>at 127.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Later that same morning, after determining Appellant’s address from the license plate information, a Haverford Township police officer, Thomas Long, drove to Appellant’s house, and spoke with Appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 52. According to Officer Long, Appellant did not appear to have any knowledge of why the officer was questioning him. <em>Id. </em>at 60. Appellant admitted to Officer Long that he offered the two boys a ride, and Appellant voluntarily agreed to Officer Long’s request to accompany him to the police station to speak further with another investigator. <em>Id. </em>at 56.</p>

I said okay, and left.” <em>Id. </em>at 70. Officer Goodman testified that Appellant looked surprised whenever the officer informed him that he had potentially violated a statute by his actions. <em>Id. </em>at 81.

After receiving a telephone call informing him of the charges, Appellant turned himself in. He proceeded to a bench trial before the Honorable Ann A. Osborne on September 26, 2007. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Osborne acquitted Appellant of the offenses of stalking and harassment. With respect to the offenses of attempted luring of a child into a motor vehicle, Judge Osborne expressly stated she found no evidence that Appellant had any intent to harm the children, <a id="p902" href="#p902" data-label="902" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*902</a>and that she believed “the circumstances show no reason to believe that this defendant had any evil or improper intent in doing what he did.” N.T. Trial, 10/2/07, at 4-5. However, on the sole basis of Appellant’s offer of the rides, she convicted him on all four counts of attempted luring. The trial court found that “[Appellant’s] offer of a ride to the victims is sufficient to constitute an attempt to ‘lure.’” Trial Court Opinion, 6/26/08, at 6. The trial court subsequently sentenced Appellant to 18 months’ probation. As an automatic result of his convictions, Appellant is now statutorily mandated to register for ten years as a sex offender under Megan’s Law, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9795.1(a)(1).</p>

Appellant also argued that he had no ill intent in offering the children a ride, but, rather, was merely acting as a “disabled Good Samaritan.” <em>Id.</em>

The court conceded that the offer in <em>Adamo </em>could have been “an invitation to sexual misconduct,” <em>Figueroa, </em><a href="/pa-super/436/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="648 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="706490,7870172" data-case-paths="/pa-super/436/0569-01,/a2d/648/0555-01">648 A.2d at 557</a>, but it determined that the <em>Adamo </em>court based its decision not on that fact, but, rather, on a strict reading of the statute and found that intent to harm was not an express requirement of Section 2910. However, the <em>Figueroa </em>court rebuffed the notion that Section 2910 was a strict liability statute, and found that, because the statute did not set forth a specific <em>mens rea </em>requirement, the default culpability standard was that set forth in Section 302(c) of the Crimes Code which provides:</p>

In fact, the trial court herein expressly analogized the circumstances of his case to those of <em>Figueroa, </em>based on the fact that his second offer of a ride was made while it was slightly raining, which, in the trial court’s view, functioned like the snow in <em>Figueroa </em>to make the offer “even more enticing.” <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 13 (quoting Trial Court Opinion, 6/26/08, at 6-7).</p>

He underscores the contradiction between the <em>Adamo </em>and <em>Figueroa </em>courts’ definition of the term, pointing out that the <em>Adamo </em>court interpreted it to be an offer of something pleasurable or financially rewarding, whereas the <em>Figueroa </em>court found that the mere offer of a ride in inclement weather conditions was sufficient. In this case, Appellant contends it was the simple prospect of getting out of a drizzle that the lower courts determined to be a sufficient enticement so as to constitute a “lure.” Appellant posits that there seems, then, to be no circumstance under which an adult, who possesses good intentions in offering a minor a ride, such as making transportation easier, faster, or removing the child from the influence of the elements, can make such an offer without violating the statute. Appellant suggests that this type of situation can occur in any neighborhood where an adult offers a child who lives there a ride to avoid inclement weather, believing that parental consent to do so would be implied from the fact the adult knows the child from seeing the child in the yard or at a bus stop and, also knows the child’s parents from similar interactions.

However, Appellant maintains that, under <em>Figueroa, </em>a mother who sees that her daughter’s friend missed the school bus cannot offer a ride; a senior citizen cannot extend a helping hand to a neighbor’s son caught in a driving rain storm; nor can a father picking up his daughter offer her friend a ride home from a school activity when she is stranded after dark, without potential criminal liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The Commonwealth proffers that when the plain meaning of the words of Section 2910 are considered they do not require any proof of an individual’s intent to harm in order for the individual to be convicted. Rather, in the Commonwealth’s view, all that the statute requires is that the Commonwealth prove a defendant: “(1) lured or attempted to lure a child; (2) into a vehicle or structure; (3) without the express or implied permission of the child’s parent or guardian; and (4) the circumstances did not reasonably indicate that the child was in need of assistance.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 11.

Instead, the Commonwealth argues that the statute was read to require “only that a defendant intend to lure a child, not harm the child once lured.” <em>Id. </em>at 14. Thus, the Commonwealth advances the contention that, in the absence of an emergency or parental consent, “an invitation into a vehicle with the intent that the child actually enters [sic] the vehicle suffices to meet the prohibitions of the statute.” <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth maintains that the legislature, in drafting Section 2910, expressly declined to include an “intent to harm” element in the statute. Thus, it claims that this omission, as well as the legislature’s specific recognition of a defense to luring a child into a structure under Section 2910(b) based on the action having been undertaken for a lawful purpose, and its corresponding failure to extend that same defense to luring a child into a motor vehicle under Section 2910(a), demonstrates that criminalization of any act of luring children into motor vehicles without parental consent or an emergency is exactly what the legislature intended. Hence, the Commonwealth contends that adding an intent to harm element to the crime statute would be contrary to the express intentions of the legislature.</p>

Consistent with the plain and unambiguous meaning of the term “lure,” we therefore hold that an attempt to lure under Section 2910 does not occur upon the mere offer of a ride in a motor vehicle to a child, but, rather, involves only situations where a child is provided a further enticement or inducement to enter the vehicle, in addition to the offer of the ride, particularly under such circumstances which suggest the child is being led into a potentially harmful situation. As the Superior Court recognized in <em>Adamo, </em>this enticement or inducement may be the promise of a pleasurable reward for entry into the vehicle such as receiving money or a treat such as candy or ice cream. Likewise, a similar attractive temptation could be created with the promise of the opportunity for the child to view an object of interest like a toy, a game, or a puppy.

Thus, both courts viewed the prospect of relief from a prospective adverse outcome to be a sufficient inducement for the child to go along with the command, and, hence, brought it within the ambit of an attempted lure. Such an interpretation is consistent with the plain meaning of the term “lure,” because a brazen order to a child to enter a vehicle made by a stranger creates a strong fear-based incentive for the child to follow that particular course of action, as he or she subjectively may believe that is the only way to avoid harm.

The addition of this affirmative defense merely indicates the legislature’s heightened concern for situations where the alleged luring involves a structure; however, this addition does not shed light on the proper interpretation of what constitutes a “lure” — a term which is used both in the definition of the offense and in the affirmative defense. Critically, then, even with this amendment, the focus remains on what conduct constitutes a "lure.”</p>

Common sense is not left at the curb, so to speak, and such implied consent is inherent in most every legitimate “Good Samaritan” situation. We need not graft lurid elements of temptation into the statute to protect the innocent — that protection exists with the requirement that there be no implied consent. We once lived in a world where offering your child’s teammate a ride home was not only accepted, it was expected. While the world has changed, there remain bastions of civility where consent of the parent would still be implied by the circumstances — I suggest most if not all of Pennsylvania would be included.
