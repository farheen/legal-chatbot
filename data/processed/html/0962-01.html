The electromotive force passing from the starting point to maximum in one sense, thence back by the starting point to maximum in another sense and thence back to the starting point constitutes a cycle, and the number of cycles per second determines “ frequency, ” which in turn governs the number of revolutions or the speed of the tool as it operates.</p>

We therefore, treat the word and the phrase as being synonymous.</p>
    <p id="b415-3" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[100,336,1320,949]]]'>Appellant’s insistence is that the evidence of the experts in the electrical art who were called shows that “ high cycle ” is not synonymous with “ high frequency ” and that the phrase from which it made its word is not, when “ high ” and “ cycle ” are considered in the light of their respective definitions, descriptive of its goods or their qualities and characteristics. It insists that “ not a single instance is in evidence by petitioner of the use of the two words ‘ high ’ and £ cycle ’ together for any purpose, in any dictionaries, textbooks or technical literature ”•; that the testimony of petitioner’s witnesses is contradictory; that there is some testimony that the words mean “ high frequency,” other testimony that they mean “ high speed ” and still other testimony that they indicate “ danger ” and the burden being upon appellee it must clearly establish that they did mean one of these, or have some meaning, in order to prevail, fact have no meaning in the art in which it is engaged as applied to the tools and products to which it is applying “ hicycle,” or at least that they had no descriptive meaning “ <em>at the time of the adoption of the mark </em>” (italics quoted) and that if they have any such meaning now it results wholly from appellant’s use, advertising</p>

This evidence is quite strong we think in <a id="p966" href="#p966" data-label="966" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*966</a>indicating both a technical and common understanding of the meaning of the words which fully comports with descriptiveness.</p>

We can not doubt that whatever distinction those having highly specialized learning as to electrical technique might be able to draw by. strict construction of electrical terms, the phrase “ high cycle,” as applied to these motor-driven tools, does convey to the public generally a definite meaning distinctly descriptive of the tools. The relation between the cycle of the current and the revolution or operation of the tool or mechanism is too direct and immediate, in our view, to admit of any other conclusion. We think it is more than suggestive and amounts to descriptiveness.</p>
