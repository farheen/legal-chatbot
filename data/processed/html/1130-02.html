Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance, </em>505 U.S. -, <a href="/us/505/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="112 S.

    <p id="b1192-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1192.27",1192,[998,1661,747,996]]]'>In this case the taxpayer, a Delaware Corporation had challenged assessments made under G.L.1956 (1988 Reenactment) § 44-11-11, 44-11-12 relating to the handling of dividends. Having exhausted its administrative remedies the taxpayer sought relief in District Court under § 8-8-24 from a decision by the Tax Administrator that certain dividends should be included in the state taxpayer’s returns. A petition for certiorari was granted in respect to two identical petitions by the taxpayer. In the meantime the U.S. Supreme Court in the above captioned case issued an opinion that would have a direct bearing on the issues involved. The tax administrator has now filed a petition for instructions indicating that the <em>Kraft </em>case was decided in the company’s favor, and requests that this case be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration in the light of <em>Kraft.</em>
