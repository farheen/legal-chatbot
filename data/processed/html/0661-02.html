The responsibilities of the Island Division public safety officer's were broader than those of police officers. In addition to their law enforcement duties, they acted as firefighters and emergency medical technicians, and were required to receive the training and medical examinations required for firefighters and to undergo emergency medical training. These requirements were not applied to officers assigned to the police department. Public safety officers’ responsibilities were limited to the geographic area of the Casco Bay islands, while officers assigned to the police department had city-wide jurisdiction. There were differences as to how they were hired, reported to superiors, and were discharged. Officers in the police department were hired pursuant to the City’s Civil Service Ordinance; public safety officers were appointed annually for a definite term pursuant to P.L.197S, ch. 135, § 1 (recodified as amended at 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2672 (Pamph. 1994)). The Department positions were not “subject to [the] public advertisement, formal hiring lists, and written and oral examinations” that the police department positions were. Public safety officers had a six-month probationary period, reported directly to the Director of Public Safety, and were subject to review in disciplinary actions by the Director of Public Safety, the Personnel Director, and the City Manager. Police department officers had a year-long probationary period, reported to the Chief of Police, and were subject to the notice and hearing requirements in P.L.1973, ch. 135, § 1 (reco-dified as amended at 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2671 (Pamph.1994)) in disciplinary proceedings. In addition, the Board, relying on the public safety officers’ 1979 collective bargaining agreement with the City that specified that they would be provided standard plan retirement benefits, found that the public safety officers viewed themselves as a different class than police officers assigned to the police department or firefighters. Following the Board’s decision, the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court, <em>see </em>5 M.R.S.A. § 17451(2) (1989); M.R.Civ.P. 80C, which affirmed the Board’s decision.</p>

The order granting the park police special benefits was passed in February 1978. These employees, who began working under Department auspices in the summer of 1977, did not technically become part of the Public Safety Department bargaining unit until late 1978, when they were deleted from their prior collective bargaining agreement. At that time, they became members of the same bargaining unit as the public safety officers.</p>
