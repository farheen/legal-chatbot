Furthermore, with the agreement and consent of all parties, the Order of the Commonwealth Court, entered December 18, 1995, is reversed and this matter is remanded to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review for further evidentiary hearing proceedings, so that Appellant may have the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him regarding the relationship, if any, between an incident occurring at his former workplace on March 8,1993, which forms the basis for his Workmen’s Compensation claim against his employer, and his employer’s decision to terminate his employment. <em>See Steinhouse v.
