At the time of his arrest, the police seized three items of jewelry from his person — two gold-colored bracelets and one Gucci watch.

The Commonwealth served interrogatories on Singleton in which he answered that he had purchased the bracelet and the watch and intended to wear those items.

Once that is established, unless there is countervailing evidence to defeat the claim, the moving party is entitled to the return of the identified property. A claim for return of property can be defeated in two ways: an opposing party can establish that it, not the moving party, is entitled to lawful possession to the property or the Commonwealth can seek forfeiture claiming that property for which return is sought is derivative contraband. <em>Commonwealth v.

Not disputing that it did not offer any evidence that the items were owned by another or direct evidence that the property was stolen, the Commonwealth argues that the property was properly forfeited because, through circumstantial evidence, it established a nexus between the property and the burglaries. It contends the nexus was established when it showed that Singleton was a burglar and the bracelet, and .the watch were recovered with another item of stolen jewelry. Because it established a criminal nexus, it argues that the burden then shifted back to Singleton to show that there was no nexus between the criminal activity and the property seized by offering evidence of his ownership, such as documentation of his purchase.</p>

      <em>Fontanez </em>is a case similar to this one. In that case, the petitioner was stopped for a traffic violation, and the detaining officer saw an open bag of cash in the vehicle. Even though the officer had not witnessed activity that would have tied the petitioner’s possession of the money to illegal conduct, the money was seized, and the petitioner filed a petition for return. To show that the money was derivative contraband, the Commonwealth offered evidence showing that the traffic stop occurred at 8:30 p.m., that the detaining officer knew the petitioner’s past involvement with drug activity, and that the petitioner refused to answer questions about the cash. To avoid self-incrimination, the petitioner did not testify and presented no evidence of ownership. The trial court denied his petition for return and granted the Commonwealth’s oral motion to forfeit. After we affirmed the trial court, our Supreme Court reversed, holding that the petitioner had satisfied his burden of lawful possession through his claim of ownership merely by establishing that the cash was in' his possession<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> and that the Commonwealth’s <a id="p1229" href="#p1229" data-label="1229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1229</a>evidence was insufficient to sustain its burden of proving that the money was contraband. Regarding the forfeiture claim, our Supreme Court went on to state that all of the evidence only established “suspicions” and not competent evidence to justify a forfeiture of property or shift the burden back to the petitioner to explain the source of the money, stating:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1277.6",1277,[196,705,715,1111]]]'>We do not believe that 8:30 p.m. is a notably late hour, and the stop took place in Appellant’s own neighborhood. Although the presence of a large amount of cash might have given rise to suspicions in light of the officer’s general “knowledge” regarding Appellant and his family, at most these suspicions merited further investigation or surveillance. Finally, a person stopped for a traffic violation has no obligation to respond to questions asked by an officer apart from statutory obligations to produce a driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance. Again, although it might arouse suspicions, failure to give an explanation where none is required cannot be construed as evidence of wrongful conduct. Accordingly, these factors taken individually or in combination, do not establish that the money was contraband. (Footnote 4.)</blockquote>

In that case, police officers observed Esquilin standing on the sidewalk with Miguel Bur-gos. Within 25 minutes, three individuals at separate times handed an unknown amount of money to Burgos who then reached into the front of his pants and pulled out small objects that he gave to each of them. He then handed the money to Esquilin. After they left the area, police were able to locate two of the three individuals, both of whom had crack cocaine in their possession. Acting on this information, the police arrested Burgos, recovering three zip-lock packets of cocaine and $7 in cash and Esquilin, who had no drugs but $6,425 in cash comprised of 48 $100 bills, two $50 bills, 69 $20 bills, eight $10 bills, 11 $5 bills, and 10 $1 bills. Esquilin was charged with criminal conspiracy and possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver, but the charges were ultimately dismissed for lack of a prompt trial.</p>

In reversing and affirming the trial court’s forfeiture of all the money, our Supreme Court distinguished <em>Fontanez </em>and <em>Marshall </em>because, in those eases, no criminal nexus had been made out because no drugs or drug paraphernalia were found and no illegal drug transactions were observed, while in <em>Esquilin, </em>the police observed three sales of crack cocaine, saw Burgos hand money to Esquilin after two of those transactions, and there was not enough money found on Burgos to represent proceeds from the sale of even one packet of cocaine.

Once the nexus was established, the burden shifted back to Singleton to establish that the property did not have any criminal nexus.

First, it argues that his failure to include the transcript of the forfeiture hearing in the certified record even after notified to do so by the Superior Court effectively waived his appellate claim. Although there may have been a clerical error when this case was appealed to the Superior Court, the transcript from the forfeiture hearing was received by the Superior Court on October 20, 2006. Second, it contends that Singleton’s appeal is defective because he did not serve Sylvester Johnson, the Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, with any of the appellate papers. The Commonwealth has heretofore defended the petition for re<a id="p1228" href="#p1228" data-label="1228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1228</a>turn and sought forfeiture before the trial court, and this argument is insufficient at this stage to result in a waiver of Singleton’s claim. Finally, it contends that Singleton’s appellate claim is waived because he failed to specifically present in his "Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal” his intention to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on which the trial court based its decision. In paragraph 3 of his Rule 1925(b) Statement, Singleton states, "In denying Mr. Singleton's Petition for Return of Property, the Court applied an incorrect and/or unreasonable standard and burden of proof.” In the context of this case and what the trial court understood it to mean, Singleton was contending that the Commonwealth’s evidence was insufficient to shift the burden of proof back to him to establish that there was no nexus with his criminal activity. Considering that the trial court addressed the issue of sufficiency of evidence, Singleton’s failure to expressly include a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence does not render his Rule 1925(b) Statement defective.</p>
