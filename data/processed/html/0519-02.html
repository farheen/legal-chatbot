      <em>See </em>D.C. Bar R. XI, § 13(e). The suspension was imposed at Brown’s request. At the time of Brown’s suspension, several serious disciplinary charges were pending against him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

On January 9, 2002, a Hearing Committee issued a Report and Recommendation in which it found, by clear and convincing evidence (as Section 13(g) requires), that Brown’s disability had ended. The Com-<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>raittee also found that Brown had demonstrated his legal competence and that he had the necessary moral character to resume the practice of law.</p>

At the time he filed his petition, he owed substantial amounts in taxes and in child support, and he was in arrears in restitution payments owed to the Client Security Fund.

These findings were based on the assessment of Brown’s credibility by the Hearing Committee, which heard him testify, and we are reluctant to second-guess the Committee’s assessment on the basis of a paper record alone. <em>See In re Shillaire, </em><a href="/a2d/597/0913-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="597 A.2d 913" data-case-ids="11944586" data-case-paths="/a2d/597/0913-01">597 A.2d 913</a>, 916 (D.C.1991).</p>
