    <blockquote id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[243,422,709,301]]]'>(1) Whether the Superior Court erred in creating a new claim for “negligent design defect” of a prescription drug, despite Plaintiff-Respondent Patsy Lance’s repeated waiver of that claim?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[243,769,709,364]]]'>(2) Whether the Superior Court’s creation of a new cause of action for “negligent design defect” conflicts with this Court’s settled precedent limiting product liability claims against manufacturers and sellers of prescription drugs?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[243,1170,706,572]]]'>(3) Whether the Superior Court’s creation of a new cause of action for “negligent design defect” should properly be argued before this Court because it may affect' hundreds or thousands of cases and ignores that: (a) plaintiffs in design defect cases must plead and prove a “feasible alternative design;” and (b) there should be deference to regulatory authorities?</blockquote>
