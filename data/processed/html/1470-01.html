Gen. Laws of Florida, 1927) to her children and their descendants; that immediately upon her death the remainder in fee became vested in her heirs, the right of possession being postponed until the death of the life tenant; that descendants of immediate heirs took by right of representation and not in their own right; that the interest the deceased daughter would have inherited if she had survived testatrix could only reach her son Campbell Elmore Arnold through her, but she being dead, one-half descended to her children and the other half to her husband and it is stated that the case of Towles v. Roundtree, <a href="/fla/10/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="10 Fla. 299" data-case-ids="1163976" data-case-paths="/fla/10/0299-01">10 Fla. 299</a>, supports such contention and is' decisive of the question.</p>

This daughter afterwards died and then the father died and a controversy arose over- the disposition of the estate of the father between the children of the deceased daughter and the surviving children of the father. The Court held that under the law the advancement by the father to the son-in-law was an advancement to his daughter and though she predecessed him (the father) the advancement should b:e -brought into hotch-potch because the “grandchildren took by succession and in their representative capacity.” <a id="p1482" href="#p1482" data-label="1482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1482</a>And the Court further held in effect that the act of the son-in law (which was binding upon his wife) in accepting the advancement affected her interest in the estate and therefore the interest of the grandchildren inasmuch as but for the right of the mother they were as much strangers with respect to the estate of the grandfather as though they wére not of his blood.</p>

It follows that no interest in the property of testatrix could vest in her deceased daughter as an heir of testatrix and then descend from such daughter to her son Campbell Elmore Arnold and to her husband, Frank Arnold could not take an interest in the property because he was not an heir of testatrix; a descendant; a person belonging' to. that class appointed by law to succeed to the estate of testatrix.</p>
