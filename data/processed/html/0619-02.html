An additional question we must resolve is whether, if an undocumented-alien claimant is eligible to receive benefits under the Act, IRCA has the preemptive effect of precluding a workers’ compensation award to such a <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>claimant that is equal to the claimant’s average weekly wage.

The CRB’s rationale for upholding the average-weekly-wage penalty — rejection of the Employer’s argument that it could not lawfully pay wage-loss benefits to Claimant — was not a sufficient basis for concluding that the Employer acted in bad faith.</p>

As described in the ALJ’s compensation order, the lens of Claimant’s right eye “had been dislocated outside of the visual field of the eye causing 100% total loss of vision” of the right eye. In July 2005, Claimant underwent surgery on his eye. Not until January 25, 2006, was Claimant cleared to return to work by his treating physician.

On July 17, 2005, although not yet cleared to return to work by his treating physician, Claimant returned to the establishment and asked to resume work part-time. According to Karim, it was then that the Employer learned that Claimant had obtained his job by using the name and papers of his cousin (Armando Casarrubias), and that Claimant himself was an undocumented alien.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Kar-<a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>ira testified that he gave Claimant money (a total of $1,000) to help pay his expenses, but told Claimant that he “could not continue to employ [Claimant] because it would be illegal” because of Claimant’s undocumented status.

Although the woi'kers’ compensation statute requires an employer either to make prompt payment of wage-loss benefits or to file a timely notice controverting the worker’s claim, the Employer neither began paying benefits nor filed a notice of controversion. The matter eventually went to hearing, and in an August 1, 2007 compensation order, the ALJ determined that Claimant was temporarily and totally disabled and entitled to benefits for the June 30, 2005-January 26, 2006 period. The ALJ found that Claimant’s wage loss for that period was attributable to his workplace injury and that Claimant’s attempt to return to work on July 17, 2005, had been against medical advice. The ALJ also found that the Employer had failed to file a timely notice of controversion and had withheld payment of compensation in bad faith. Upon the finding of bad faith, the ALJ awarded Claimant wage-loss benefits in the amount of Claimant’s average weekly wage ($362.66), as provided in D.C.Code § 32-1528(b) (2001).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The ALJ also awarded Claimant an additional ten percent as a penalty on the Employer for failure to timely file a notice of controversion,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> as well as interest on accrued benefits.

In a nutshell, the Employer’s argument is that the compensation order effectively required the Employer to pay wages to Claimant for the disability period even though IRCA prohibited the Employer from employing Claimant upon discovery of his undocumented status. As the Employer puts it, “if Intervenor could not be rehired because of IRCA, he also could not receive any wages from Asylum, once his illegal status was discovered.” The CRB, however, concluded that “IRCA does not preempt” the average-weekly-wage penalty provision of the Act or “excuse an employer[ ] [from] compliance” with a compensation order directing the employer to pay a claimant’s average weekly wage for the period of the claimant’s temporary total disability. <em>Gonzalez, </em>2008 DC Wrk.

The Act requires a look backward, to the average weekly wage a claimant earned in the period prior to his injury, as a proxy for the loss of wage-earning capacity. <em>See, e.g., </em>D.C.Code § 32-1511(a)(4) (“If at the time of injury wages are fixed by the day, hour, or by the output of the employee, the average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing by 26 the total wages the employee earned in the employ of the employer in the 26 consecutive calendar weeks <em>immediately preceding the injury.”) </em>(italics added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> And, as already déscribed, temporary total disability benefits generally are based on “66 2/3% of the employee’s average weekly wages.” D.C.Code § 32-1508(2) (2001).

In short, the average-weekly-wage award here was not designed to pay Claimant what he would have earned as part of Employer’s workforce from June 30, 2005 to January 26, 2006.

We agree. As shown by the quoted material from the compensation order, the ALJ did not shift the burden back to Claimant because he found “no record or evidence anywhere as to the employer’s reasons for not paying or else controverting the claimant’s claim.” In making that statement, the ALJ appears to have assumed — incorrectly in either case — that filing a notice of controversion is sufficient to negate bad faith or that failure to file a notice of controversion is sufficient by itself to demonstrate bad faith. In addition, in finding that there was no evidence in the record of a reason for the Employer’s delay in paying or controverting the claim, the ALJ ignored Kar-im’s testimony that he did not know what a notice of controversion was (an assertion that, if credited, would make it inappropriate to treat the failure to file such a notice as evidence of bad faith).

We do not accept that logic. Heretofore, this court has not addressed the issue of the eligibility of undocumented alien workers for wage-loss benefits under the Act, and, as the Court of Appeals of Maryland has observed, the Supreme Court’s opinion in <em>Hoffman </em>“provided the foundation for arguments by employers that undocumented/illegal workers are ineligible for workers’ compensation benefits because such benefits are preempted or because employment contracts with such workers are illegal.” <em>Design Kitchen &amp; Baths, </em>882 A.2d at 829.

Employer appears to rely on Karim's statement as the record basis for its argument that Employer’s reasoning was that "if Intervenor could not be rehired because of IRCA, he also could not receive any wages from Asylum, once his illegal status was discovered.” While the ALJ may have discredited Karim’s testimony, he did not so state in the compensation order (and, as to other issues, such as the date when Claimant attempted to return to work, the ALJ credited Karim’s testimony over Claimant’s). In addition, the ALJ did not, either explicitly or implicitly, credit Claimant's testimony that the Employer knew that he was working under his cousin’s name over Karim’s testimony that the Employer learned this only when Claimant attempted to return to work after sustaining his injury. The ALJ also made no finding about the testimony by Claimant and Claimant's witness Manuel Gonzales that the Employer permitted others to work at the establishment while knowing that their documents were not legal.</p>

The Employer also argues that the ALJ ignored the Employer’s offer of a settlement payment (in the amount of "67% permanent loss of use of Claimant’s eye,” amounting to $17,764.38) to Claimant in June 2006, as well as the Employer’s payment of Claimant’s medical bills (in April and May of 2006). However, these facts do not appear to be relevant to whether Employer acted in bad faith in delaying payment of benefits in the period immediately following Claimant's application for benefits in August 2005.</p>

Indeed, as the AU recognized, such factors "made the filing of a notice of controversion [even] more warranted.” The Employer complains that the ALJ made no finding as to when the notice of controversion should have been filed, but, as the CRB recognized, the Employer waived this claim by agreeing, in its "Employer-Insurer’s Reply to Claimant's Response and Motion to Dismiss Petition for Review” (submitted to the CRB on February 5, 2008), that ”[t]he ... sanction which should have been allowed here was the penalty for failing to file a Notice of Controversion."</p>

This is notwithstanding the fact that most courts that have ruled on the issue have held that IRCA does not bar payment of workers’ compensation benefits to unauthorized aliens. <em>See generally </em>3 Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson's Workers’ Compensation Law </em>§ 66.03[3][a] (Rev. ed. 2010) (explaining that courts generally have not understood IRCA's preemption of inconsistent state laws “as barring any sort of payment on behalf of injured workers").</p>
