Bell, alleged that he was the duly elected and qualified Superintendent of Public Instruction of said county, occupying said office and exercising all the functions thereof, under authority of a commission issued on March 19, 1929, by the Governor of the State. That the members of the Board of Public Instruction had for the past several months refused to audit and pay petitioner’s account for compensation, assigning as the reason for such refusal the rendition of a judgment of ouster in a cause lately pending in’ the Circuit Court of Charlotte County wherein one Paul Eddy was contestant and petitioner was eontestee; that said cause is now pending in Supreme Court of Florida upon writ of error to said judgment, and that by virtue of an order of supersedeas and the posting and approval of a bond in compliance with said order the said judgment has been and is now superseded, and that the refusal to audit and pay his salary is wholly without authority of law. A copy of the commission and order of supersedeas and bond referred to were attached as exhibits to the petition. The order of supersedeas referred to was dated March 7, 1930, and the supersedeas bond was approved and filed on March 8, 1930.

E. Bell from said office; that said judgment had been taken to the Supreme Court on writ of error and the relator had not filed such a supersedeas bond as was sufficient to take care of and indemnify the said Paul Eddy against any payment of salary and thereby protecting the respondents from any such illegal payment.

The motion to file the foregoing amended answer was, as shown by the record, made on. October 8, 1930, subsequent to the granting of the peremptory writ, but the transcript shows that such motion was denied by the court on August 16, 1930, on which date the peremptory writ of mandamus was ordered and issued by the court.

See Section 6 of Article VIII, and Section 2 of Article XVI of the Constitution, and Sections 459-461 Comp. Gen. Laws. The office here in question is a constitutional office and the term is fixed at four years. Sec. 6, Art. VIII, of Const.

This appears to be in accordance with the decisions in other jurisdictions. 46 C. J. 1016; 22 R. C. L. 554-5. We see no good reason why this rule should not apply, even in cases where the period of holding over is prolonged by reason of an election contest, at least where no fraud or bad faith is charged or shown on the part of the officer holding over.

This would appear to be in harmony'with the meaning and intent of Section 446, Comp. Gen. Laws, under authority of which the judgment of ouster was rendered, and which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[313,1501,1015,539]]]'>‘ ‘ Section 446.
