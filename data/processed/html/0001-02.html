    <p id="b60-22" data-blocks='[["BL_60.19",60,[1024,797,753,1585]]]'>The proceedings began in the trial court as a petition filed by the government on April 17, 1991, pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-2301 <em>et seq., </em>alleging that the child, then 19 months old, was a neglected child. Following an initial court hearing, held the same day, the court found probable cause to support the neglect allegations and placed the child in shelter care with the D.C. Department of Human Services (“DHS”). The child was subsequently placed at St. Anne’s Infant and Maternity Home (“St. Anne’s”), an institutional facility for neglected children, where he remained for approximately one year. On January 23, 1992, following a trial on the neglect petition, Judge Gregory E. Mize adjudicated the child neglected pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-2301(9)(C),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> because of the mother’s mental illness. Judge Mize specifically rejected a neglect adjudication pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-2301(9)(B), because the child was not without “proper care or control, subsistence, education ... or other care or control necessary for his physical, mental or emotional health.” DHS then, through a private foster-care agency on contract with DHS, For Love of Children (“FLOC”), placed the child in foster care with the foster mother and J.S., her female companion. On March 31, 1992, following a disposition hearing on the neglect case, the trial court entered a disposition order committing the child to DHS.</p>

      <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>Thereafter, the trial court conducted regular review hearings in the neglect case during which the court received information on the mother’s condition, including psychiatric evaluations and assessments. On July 8, 1992, the great-aunt appeared in court and expressed interest in obtaining custody of the child. On November 5, 1992, having been advised that DHS and FLOC would be recommending an immediate change in placement for the child to the great-aunt’s home, the foster mother filed a petition to adopt the child. On May 24, 1998, the great-aunt filed a complaint for custody, which was consolidated with the neglect and adoption cases.</p>

The mother, who appeared briefly on one day of the proceedings, did not testify. The father did not appear. Both the child’s parents, however, supported the great-aunt’s custody complaint. A total of sixteen witnesses testified, and a number of reports and exhibits were received into evidence. On January 7, 1994, the trial court entered an order granting the foster mother’s adoption petition, denying the great-aunt’s custody complaint, and effectively terminating the mother’s parental rights.</p>

In the contest for custody between the great-aunt and the foster mother, the court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it was in the best interest of the child to grant the foster mother’s adoption petition. The court found that both the foster mother and the great-aunt would provide T.J. with a warm and loving home, and that he would have a clearer sense of his racial, cultural, and family identity if he was raised by the great-aunt with his extended family. Nevertheless, because of the strong attachment that had formed between the child and the foster mother, the court determined that the risk of harm to the child if he was removed from his foster mother’s care outweighed those considerations. Thus, concluded the trial judge, it was in the child’s best interest to be adopted by the foster mother. This consolidated appeal followed. Because the parties contentions focused on the weight of the evidence and the parties’ relative eviden-tiary burdens, we will set forth the evidence in some detail.</p>

He lived with his mother until he was nineteen months old. The mother suffers from a chronic mental illness (schizoaffective disorder) which, even with treatment, renders her unable to take care of her son on any kind of long-term basis. The child’s father has never lived with the mother or the child, has never been involved in the child’s life, and has no plans to assume care of the child.</p>

Several days later, DHS returned the child to her care. Over the next five months, on about four occasions, the mother requested and received emergency care placement for the child for periods of three to ten days because she was overwhelmed with the task of caring for him. On some of these occasions, the child was placed with his great-aunt. In February 1991, the mother placed the child in voluntary foster care at St. Anne’s for one month, after which he was returned to her care. On April 17, 1991, the mother again indicated her inability to care for the child and the District filed a neglect petition alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the mother was unable to care for the child due <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>to mental illness. The child, then nineteen months old, was placed at St. Anne’s. During that period, the great-aunt was unwilling to care for the child for an extended period without the mother’s consent or a court order giving her custody. The great-aunt testified that she was seeking to avoid a repetition of the conflicts she had encountered with the mother, including threats of violence and vandalism to her home by the mother, which occurred ten years earlier, when the great-aunt assumed custody of A.J., the mother’s twelve-year old daughter, who is T.J.’s sister.</p>
    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[241,890,755,888]]]'>The child remained at St. Anne’s for approximately one year pending a fact-finding hearing and disposition. During that time, he experienced behavioral, emotional, learning, and speech problems attributed to his early chaotic life with his mother. St. Anne’s initiated behavioral, language and speech therapy, which continued some time after his placement with his foster family. The mother visited the child frequently during his stay at St. Anne’s, and the great-aunt visited him once, because she would not “go over [the mother’s] head” by visiting the child. On July 8,1992, three months after the child was committed to foster care with the foster mother, the great-aunt appeared in court and expressed an interest in obtaining custody of the child. She later filed a custody complaint on May 24, 1993.</p>

    <p id="b62-6" data-blocks='[["BL_62.6",62,[237,1890,752,510]]]'>The <em>foster mother </em>became a foster parent through FLOC, an organization which administers a program for foster care. Before M.H. became T.J.’s foster mother, she, and her companion, J.S., attended a FLOC training program, where they were instructed that foster care is a temporary service, with a goal of returning the child to the birth family, first to the birth parents, if possible, and then to birth relatives. The foster mother signed a contract to that effect.</p>

Additionally, he only spoke between ten to twenty words. He became clingy towards his foster mother, making separation from her very difficult, and was withdrawn and non-responsive towards others at school and home. His behavior improved after a few months in foster care. The child became talkative, his tantrums subsided, and he displayed a significant interest in physical activity. At the home of his foster mother, the child has his own room and access to a recreation room, a den, and a backyard in which he can play. The child attends an interracial kindergarten and interacts well with children there. He attends church and has friends of various races. The foster mother and her companion, who are both white, have taken the child to various African-American festivals and celebrations, read books to him with African-American characters and have posters of Martin Luther King and of black children portrayed in a positive way. The child is fully integrated into his foster faimly, his school and church, and his multi-cultural, multi-racial neighborhood and community. The foster mother has a close network of friends and acquaintances, both married and single, through school, work, church and her neighborhood.</p>
    <p id="b62-10" data-blocks='[["BL_62.11",62,[1038,1723,748,842]]]'>When the child was first placed with his foster mother, the agency goal was reunification with his mother. The foster mother complied with the court-ordered visitation with his natural mother and great-aunt, but made no attempts to add extra visits, lengthen visits or add makeup visits. The FLOC social worker testified that she found it difficult to get the foster mother and her companion to cooperate with regard to permanency planning. The relationship between FLOC and the foster mother deteriorated to the extent that FLOC notified the foster mother in writing that she had breached their contract, and would be terminated as general foster parent, retaining that status only as to T.J. during the pendency of this case.</p>

On July 6, 1992, the social worker contacted the foster mother’s companion, and initiated discussion as to whether the foster mother and her companion would be interested in adopting the child. The social worker also contacted the great-aunt, who indicated that she was not prepared to offer the child a home at that time. The social worker informed the great-aunt of the upcoming court review scheduled for July 8, 1992. The great-aunt attended the July 8, 1992 review hearing, and the judge, without addressing the issue of the child’s permanent placement, authorized experimental, overnight/weekend visits for the child with his great-aunt at FLOC’s discretion. The social worker testified that the great-aunt did not begin visits with the child until September 11, 1992, followed by a late October visit. Both these meetings took place at FLOC. After these two visits, the FLOC social worker indicated that she wanted to schedule weekend visits, and the foster mother’s companion indicated that she did not think it was appropriate because of the child’s reactions and regressions after visits with his mother, and during and after the two visits with his great-aunt at FLOC. It was at that point that the foster mother and her companion learned that FLOC would be recommending an immediate change of placement for the child at the scheduled November 18, 1992 court review. The foster mother testified that after consulting with various child mental health professionals, including the child’s therapist, she filed the instant petition for adoption on November 5, 1992.</p>

He also ordered a home study of both the great-aunt and the foster mother by the Court’s Social Services Division, and experimental, overnight/weekend visits with the great-aunt at FLOC’s discretion, but not to exceed once every two weeks.</p>

No matter what he was told, the child would view the move to his great-aunt’s home as an abandonment by the “parents” he had come to trust; severing the attachment would result in long-term serious harm to the adoptee, who was still a vulnerable child.

The judge found that against long odds, the child had succeeded in establishing a son/mother attachment with his foster mother, and that bond should not be severed. The trial court set forth the evidentiary burdens of the great-aunt and the foster mother as follows:</p>

Thus, the father did not seek to preserve, as the mother does in this case, the parent-child relationship; he was willing to have that relationship terminated in favor of one of the competing non-parents. The circumstances are quite different where a mentally or physically disabled parent is seeking to preserve the parent-child and family relationship through the support of a custodial plan for his or her child’s care as set forth in a petition for custody which is being considered along with a petition for adoption filed by an unrelated person. For the reasons previously stated, the higher clear and convincing standard must apply because of the parent's protected interest in determining the upbringing of his or her child, and because the issues concern the termination of those rights.</p>

A preponderance of the evidence is "proof which leads the [fact finder] to find that the existence of the contested fact is more plausible than its non-existence.” <em>In re D.I.S., </em><a href="/a2d/494/1300-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="494 A.2d 1316" data-case-ids="7922960" data-case-paths="/a2d/494/1300-01">494 A.2d at 1326</a> (quoting McCormick on Evidence § 339 (E.

As we emphasized in <em>In re L.L., </em><a href="/a2d/653/0873-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="653 A.2d 873" data-case-ids="7875192" data-case-paths="/a2d/653/0873-01">653 A.2d at 884-86</a>, the governing statute requires that the trial court give weight to the child's need for continuity of care, the emotional needs of the child, and the child’s attachment to the foster mother. See D.C.Code § 16-2353(b) (1989). The same statute, however, requires the trial court to consider the child's interaction with others including parents and siblings. As noted in the text the great-aunt has raised T.J.'s sister for ten years and, as the trial court found, TJ. is "very attached” to the sister.</p>
