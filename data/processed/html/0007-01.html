It is our belief that the term “income” in § 15-5-16.1 should not be interpreted to include the appreciation of common stock representing a minority interest in a privately held corporation. If the Legislature had intended to include the “appreciation” of property acquired before marriage, it could have used that term. It obviously knew the difference between income and appreciation because it used the term “appreciation” earlier in the same section when, in referring to the numerous factors the trial justice must consider in allocating the marital property, it specifically included as one of the factors “the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates * * The Legislature did not say “appreciation” when it mentioned property acquired before marriage, however; it said “income,” and we will not ascribe an intent that does not appear on the face of the statute.

In early December 1979 the trial justice amended the support order mentioned earlier. That decree had directed Alfred to pay the mortgage, taxes, utilities, and insurance on the family home and to pay Alma $100 per week for food and miscellaneous.

We think that case supports Alfred more than it supports Alma. In <em>Morry </em>the husband sought to reduce his child-support payments when his income went down and his legitimate expenses went up. The reduction was granted, and the former wife claimed that one of the husband’s capital assets, namely, a $5,000 note she owed him five years hence, should have been considered as a source of funds with which to pay support. The court disagreed because even though under <em>McHenry </em>capital assets may be considered, it did not consider the note a capital asset since it was payable by the former wife and its value was therefore, in the words of the trial justice in <em>Morry, </em>“speculative.”</p>

He went on to say that both parties had contributed equally to the acquisition of the family estate and that both had been involved in the day-to-day running of the house and raising of the children. For reasons not apparent from the record, he then awarded all interest in the marital home to Alma but failed to allocate to Alfred any comparable asset or assets. This apparent inconsistency entitles Alfred to a new hearing at which his claim to a share of the marital property will be considered without regard to his stock.</p>

The trial justice was entitled to draw from the evidence his own conclusion, that is, that Alfred was not nearly so incapacitated as his doctor believed. He stated on the record the reasons for his conclusion, and we believe he had ample evidence from which to draw this conclusion.</p>

We think the trial justice did take this fact into account but was more impressed by the testimony from and about Alfred concerning his em-ployability. He apparently thought, as did the trial justice in <em>Brierly v. Brierly, <a href="/a2d/431/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="431 A.2d 410" data-case-ids="7964178" data-case-paths="/a2d/431/0410-01">supra,</a> </em>that Alfred’s actions amounted to a deliberate abandonment of a lucrative job to avoid alimony payments. The trial justice had ample evidence from which to draw this conclusion.</p>

By no means are <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>we suggesting that the 1981 distribution was inequitable or that the trial justice must distribute the marital assets differently on remand. We are merely suggesting that he clarify whether or not Alfred is to share in the distribution of the marital domicile.</p>

At one point in this lengthy litigation the trial justice ordered Alfred to pay Alma over $17,000 in arrearages for her support or spend five days in the Adult Correctional Institutions. Alfred chose at the last minute to pay the money, which he obtained by selling his ten shares of Lance to the corporation for $80,000 in cash.</p>
