Although the record demonstrates appellee is far from a good parent, appellee’s conduct does not constitute quite the requisite clear, direct, weighty and convincing evidence which shows a settled purpose of relinquishment of parental claim for at least six months prior to the filing of the petition, and it is not clear that termination would serve the best interests of the children. In my view, an appellate court is somewhat more than a rubber stamp in cases of this sort. Here Superior Court took note of the evidence of the “strong bond” between appellee and the children and that judicially breaking it would be prejudicial to the best interests of the children. I would leave it at that. As the Opinion in Support of Reversal recognizes, “... the complete and irrevocable termination of parental rights is one of the most serious and severe steps a court can take ...” and here the record does not meet the test as I see it.</p>

The couple separated in October, 1987. At that time, Bowman was in the military stationed in Okinawa and Shuey resided in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania. Shuey retained primary custody of the children. From October, 1987, until April 5, 1988, Bowman had no contact whatsoever with his sons.
