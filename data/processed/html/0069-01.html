He was ordered to pay a $30,000 fine and placed on supervised probation for a period of three years. This court received a certified copy of his judgment of conviction on November 3, 1993.</p>

XI, § 10(c), this court suspended respondent from the practice of law in the District of Columbia on November 10, 1993, pending formal proceedings by the Board of Professional Responsibility to determine whether he had engaged in a crime of moral turpitude within the meaning of D.C.Code § ll-2503(a). Both Bar Counsel and the Board have concluded that a felony involving intent to defraud constitutes a crime of moral turpitude. We agree. <em>See In re Fox, </em><a href="/a2d/627/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="627 A.2d 511" data-case-ids="7355700" data-case-paths="/a2d/627/0511-01">627 A.2d 511</a> (D.C. 1993) (mail fraud); <em>In re Bond, </em><a href="/a2d/519/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="519 A.2d 165" data-case-ids="7927046" data-case-paths="/a2d/519/0165-01">519 A.2d 165</a> (D.C.1986) (mail and wire fraud); <em>In re Anderson, </em><a href="/a2d/474/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="474 A.2d 145" data-case-ids="7952622" data-case-paths="/a2d/474/0145-01">474 A.2d 145</a> (D.C.1984) (false pretenses). One of the elements of the crime of misapplication of the funds of a lending institution is intent to defraud. <em>See United States v. Musacchio, </em><a href="/f2d/940/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="940 F.2d 486" data-case-ids="10523589" data-case-paths="/f2d/940/0486-01">940 F.2d 486</a>, 491 (9th Cir.1991); <em>United States v.

Accordingly, a violation of <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20657" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="18 U.S.C. §§ 657">18 U.S.C. §§ 657</a> and 2 (1994) constitutes a crime of moral turpitude under D.C.Code § 11-2503.</p>

We adopt the Board's recommendations and order respondent disbarred, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as of November 10,1993. We further direct that the five years within which respondent shall be ineligible for reinstatement shall run from the date on which he files the required affidavit. <em>See </em>D.C.Bar R. XI, § 16(c).</p>
