Once assessments are made, there <a id="p1254" href="#p1254" data-label="1254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1254</a>is a three-level appeal process consisting of (1) an informal first-level appeal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (2) an administrative hearing before the BRPAA, and (3) an appeal to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The hearing panel for a first-level appeal is usually comprised of three to five assessors. Appeals that proceed through the first level may result in an increase in the assessment, a decrease, or no change. By informal practice, a fourth option of “withdrawal” evolved among the assessors in the Major Properties Section. Under what came to be known as the “five o’clock rule,” a property owner could withdraw a first-level appeal in writing before 5:00 p.m. on the day of the informal hearing, thereby avoiding the risk of an increased assessment.</p>

AOBA’s testimony was very critical of the first-level appeal process. It focused, in particular, on the perceived unfairness of OTR’s practice of basing increases on information not considered when determining the initial assessment. This practice, according to AOBA, had a chilling effect on appeals. Soon after this hearing, DCFO Huff and Mr. Branham discussed ways to eliminate this perceived unfairness.</p>
    <p id="b1302-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1302.11",1302,[1006,745,754,1080]]]'>Months later, on August 15, 2001, at the direction of DCFO Huff, Mr. Branham approached appellant and expressed the view that increases on first-level appeals resulting from consideration of information which the assessors initially missed were “not a good idea,” and that if the assessors missed the estimated market value in one tax year, they should leave it alone and increase it in the following tax year. Appellant disagreed with this philosophy, opining that a greater number of appeals would result because a taxpayer could now bring an appeal without risking an increase. Nevertheless, appellant and Mr. Branham agreed that the assessors should be permitted to continue with the first-level appeal process, make their decisions on estimated market value, and then sit down with Mr. Branham to review the evidence that supported the decisions.</p>

One of the cases involved a significant assessment increase for a downtown office building. Mr. Branham acknowledged that the building had been underassessed, and that the first-level appeal decision would result in an increase in property taxes for that building. He then instructed appellant to contact the attorney who filed the first-level appeal to inform him of the increased <a id="p1255" href="#p1255" data-label="1255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1255</a>assessment, and to offer the attorney an opportunity to withdraw the appeal. Appellant testified at the hearing below that he was “stunned” by this order and, without informing Mr. Branham, decided not to comply with it because he believed it to be illegal.</p>
    <p id="b1303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1303.5",1303,[94,675,754,819]]]'>Some time later, appellant and Mr. Branham met again to discuss two other properties — one at L’Enfant Plaza North and the other at Hamilton Square — for which a first-level hearing had also resulted in increased assessments. Referring to the attorney for the Hamilton Square property, Mr. Branham said to appellant, “Why don’t you call her? ... Maybe I’ll just call her.” In response to Mr. Bran-ham’s call, the attorney sent a withdrawal letter for the Hamilton Square property. Appellant understood that he was supposed to consider the appeal as “withdrawn” at that point, but he testified that he believed doing so would be illegal.</p>

Appellant also revealed that earlier that day he had reported Branham to the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) for the “illegal” August 23 order and other “unethical and/or illegal” conduct (apparently referring to Mr. Branham’s call to the representative for the Hamilton Square property). Finally, appellant told Mr. Branham that on August 31 he had mailed out increase notices to nineteen taxpayers without discussing their cases with Mr. Bran-ham or getting his approval to mail the notices (as appellant had agreed to do at their August 15 meeting). The trial court found this action to be “in knowing violation of Branham’s directives.” Mr. Bran-ham responded, ‘Well, I’ll have to let you go. I thought we could work this out, but if you want to do things your way, I’ll have to let you go.” Later that day, DCFO Huff, Director Riley, and Mr. Branham decided to place appellant on administrative leave, pending his termination, because he had been insubordinate and had violated a direct order not to issue increases on first-level appeals.</p>

The complaint alleged a violation of the WPA, and the TRO motion sought to prevent the Chief Financial Officer from exercising his at-will authority to terminate appellant’s employment. On September 19, after an <em>in camera </em>hearing, the court issued an order temporarily restraining the defendants from terminating appellant for a period of five days. The TRO was later extended pending an evi-dentiary hearing on appellant’s motion for a preliminary injunction. In due course an evidentiary healing was held on that motion, and on February 14, 2002, the motion was denied in a written order, accompanied by a twenty-three-page memorandum opinion containing findings of fact and conclusions of law.

On the contrary, appellant’s argument is highly speculative. <em>See National Student Ass’n v. Hershey, </em><a href="/citations/?q=134%20U.S.%20App.%20D.C.%2056" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="134 U.S. App. D.C. 56">134 U.S.App. D.C. 56</a>, 66-67, <a href="/f2d/412/1103-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="412 F.2d 1103" data-case-ids="2187539" data-case-paths="/f2d/412/1103-01">412 F.2d 1103</a>, 1113-1114 (1969) (“we are not persuaded that every plaintiff who alleges a First Amendment chilling effect and shivers in court has thereby established a case or controversy”). At the hearing, appellant put on no evidence whatsoever of a chilling effect, and on appeal he states only that “[t]he risk that other employees may be deterred from providing testimony or from protecting their own rights has been found by other courts to constitute irreparable harm.” This statement is completely inadequate to establish irreparable harm. <em>See Nichols, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/18/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="18 F. Supp. 2d 1" data-case-ids="11678854" data-case-paths="/f-supp-2d/18/0001-01">18 F.Supp.2d at 5</a> (plaintiffs “single-statement allegation, buttressed by no factual support, cannot support a finding of irreparable injury based on a putative chilling effect”). Because appellant offered no evidence of a chilling effect on other employees, it is at least equally possible that other employees may very well be emboldened to exercise their rights under the WPA if appellant is ultimately vindicated. This is all the more likely because appellant does not allege, and the record does not establish, any history of retaliation by OTR.</p>

As for the regulations, the DCFO is granted very broad discretion in deciding how to determine a property’s estimated market value. <em>See </em>9 DCMR § 307.2 (“the Deputy Chief Financial Officer may apply, when appropriate, one or more of the generally recognized approaches to valuation ... or any other method the [DCFO] deems necessary to arrive at estimated market value”); <em>see also Wolf, supra </em>note 11, 611 A.2d at 48. This broad discretion in determining methodology is granted because, as even appellant’s expert testified, establishing the estimated market value is by no means an exact science. Consequently, it cannot be said that the estimated market value arrived at during the first-level appeal hearing is the only possible assessment based on the “most current, accurate, and conclusive evidence.” On the contrary, we think it was quite reasonable for OTR to conclude, in light of its expertise in this area, that the initial assessment likewise met that requirement.

This is not a meaningful distinction. As we have pointed out, 9 DCMR § 306.2 requires assessments to be made “on the basis of the most current, accurate, and conclusive evidence of market value.” Under the five o’clock rule, even though a decision had yet to be reached, more recent information was adduced at the hearing, thereby creating a more “current” and perhaps “accurate” body of information. Thus, if appellant’s reasoning were followed to its logical conclusion, no withdrawal could be allowed under either policy. It was inconsistent, and therefore unreasonable, for appellant to believe that the new OTR policy was illegal, while at the same time endorsing the previous five o’clock rule.

Appellant argues in the alternative that OTR acted illegally by creating a new rule when it adopted the new policy of no increases after first-level appeals. According to appellant, not only does OTR not have express rulemaking authority, but it did not promulgate this new rule in accordance with the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act, D.C.Code §§ 2-501 to 2-511. Because appellant did not make this argument below, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. Avirom, </em><a href="" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="127 U.S. App. D.C. 367">127 U.S.App. D.C. 367</a>, 369-370, <a href="/f2d/384/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="384 F.2d 319" data-case-ids="2082277,4067961" data-case-paths="/f2d/384/0319-01">384 F.2d 319</a>, 321-322 (1967).</p>

The term "reasonable” is not defined in the WPA, and this court has not yet had an opportunity to consider it in a published opinion.

When the ruling remained unchanged, appellant sent a letter to someone in the Executive Office of the Mayor, in which he characterized the BRPAA hearing process as a “circus” and requested the Mayor’s office to intervene in the case. Again, about a year later, appellant sent a letter to the Chairperson complaining about her refusal in another case to admit certain evidence, accusing the taxpayer’s attorney and an expert witness of fraudulent conduct. The Chairperson replied in a letter that she found appellant’s comments to be, in the words of the trial court, "unprofessional and unmerited.”</p>

Appellant testified that he was unaware he was receiving two homestead exemptions, even though he had access to computerized information regarding the tax status of all residential properties in the District of Columbia, and even though he had received a tax bill in 2001 (which he paid with his own check) indicating that the N Street property had been granted an exemption.

Because appellant did not meet the first two requirements for a preliminary injunction (irreparable harm and likelihood of success), we need not address the other two in any detail. We note, however, that the trial court quite properly considered all four. With respect to the balancing of the parties’ interests, the court said that appellant "failed to demonstrate that more harm would result to him from a denial of the injunction than would result to defendants from its grant. The restoration of a willfully insubordinate employee to his former work unit would be counterproductive to an effective employment environment.” With respect to the public interest, the court said that appellant "failed to demonstrate that the public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of the requested order. Maximization of real estate tax assessments is not the only public interest. The public is also entitled to assurances that tax assessments and collections are pursued fairly and professionally.” We see no reason to quarrel with either of these rulings.</p>
