On September 2, 1994, Cherlyn Burdick tendered a personal check in the amount of $175.25 to Windsor representing the premium payment for automobile insurance policy 1373210312 (the policy). A policy was issued on September 3, 1994 and was to be effective from that date until September 3, 1995. On September 12, 1994, Curtis Calaman, as an authorized operator of Burdick’s vehicle, struck and injured appellant, a minor who was riding his bicycle at the time of the accident. On September 15, 1994, Windsor presented Burdick’s check for payment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The following day, the drawee bank returned the check to Windsor indicating that it had not been honored on the basis of insufficient funds.

      <p id="b355-20" data-blocks='[["BL_355.20",355,[957,2349,755,358]]]'>. In <em>O'Brien v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/455/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="455 Pa. Super. 568" data-case-ids="947382" data-case-paths="/pa-super/455/0568-01">455 Pa.Super. 568</a>, <a href="/a2d/689/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="689 A.2d 254" data-case-ids="11924289,947382" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0254-01,/pa-super/455/0568-01">689 A.2d 254</a> (1997), this Court addressed the issue of whether recision of a contract for automobile insurance was properly rescinded in light of the specific provisions of Pennsylvania’s Assigned Risk Plan. As Pennsylvania’s Assigned Risk Plan has no bearing on the present case, we find the holding in <em>O’Brien </em>does not apply.</p>
