Following the assault, Mrs. Gonsalves ran to Camp Street, hailed a passing motorist, and asked to be taken to the Miriam Hospital. While en route to the hospital, Mrs. Gonsalves gave the driver, Warren Dreher (Dreher), a description of her assailant by detailing the clothing he was wearing and by describing his physical characteristics. As they passed the corner of Camp and Cypress Streets, Dreher noticed an individual who fit the description Mrs. Gonsalves had given him. Dreher slowed his vehicle and Mrs. Gonsalves identified the individual as her assailant. Both Dreher and Gon-salves then watched the man walk toward them down Camp Street until he turned into the courtyard of an apartment building. <em>See Holland I, </em><a href="/ri/122/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="405 A.2d 1211" data-case-ids="5543813" data-case-paths="/ri/122/0339-01">405 A.2d at 1213</a>.</p>

Relying upon defense counsel’s representations that defendant had been informed of the date and time of the scheduled hearing, the trial justice made a preliminary finding that defendant was voluntarily absent from the hearing. Following the state’s presentation of its evidence, the trial justice issued an arrest warrant to secure defendant’s presence at the hearing and postponed a determination on the matter until defendant had been given an opportunity to explain the reasons for his absence. At that subsequent hearing, defendant was given an adequate opportunity to explain his absence. However, his explanation directly contradicted an explanation he had earlier offered to the court following his arrest in Fall River. It is clear nevertheless that the trial justice chose not to believe either explanation. In his bench decision in this matter, the trial justice stated:</p>

It was agreed that Monday, October 22, 1979, would be a satisfactory date. Because it was a Monday, it was agreed that the judge and the lawyers would be occupied with other matters in the morning. Consequently, we set it down for 2:00 P.M. Now, Mr. Kelley made it clear throughout the hearing that he notified Mr. Holland to be present in this court at 2:00 P.M. on October 22, 1979. But based on the assurance from Mr. Kelley that he would be here and his client would be here, the State of Rhode Island went to great expense to bring the witness, Warren Dre-her, who in the meantime has moved to San Francisco, California. Mr. Dreher was here to testify on October 22. Everyone was here except Ira Holland. The hearing continued into October 23, and since Mr. Holland had not put in an appearance, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was apprehended several weeks later in Fall River, and he was brought into this courtroom on November 30, 1979. With him at the time was Assistant Public Defender Marvin Clemons. We indicated to Mr. Holland at that time that he had been expected to be present for the hearing on October 22, and I believe the transcript will show that he spontaneously stated that he did not show up on October 22 because he did not know about the hearing.

At that time, G.L. 1956 (1969 Reenactment) § 11-37-1 was the statutory codification of the common-law crime of rape. The Legislature by P.L. 1979, ch. 302, § 2, subsequently repealed this section and substituted therefor a new statutory scheme setting forth various degrees of sexual assault and the penalties therefor.</p>

In remanding the case, we noted that if the trial justice found that the pretrial identification did not violate due-process fairness standards, or that the in-court identification had an independent source, the judgment of conviction would be affirmed in conformity with the resolution of defendant’s other issue on appeal. If the trial justice found otherwise, defendant would be given a new trial.</p>

We note that to place upon a person or to have a person in a lineup wear something similar to that worn by the perpetrators of a crime is not necessarily, in and of itself, unduly suggestive nor is it necessarily a denial of due process. For example, in <em>United States v. Wade, <a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">388 </a></em><a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">U.S. 218</a>, <a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">87 S.Ct. 1926</a>, <a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">18 L.Ed.2d 1149</a> (1967) the persons in the lineup in which the defendant appeared were required to wear strips of tape on their face such as allegedly worn by the robber and each person was required to repeat words uttered by the robber at the time of the crime. Also, in <em>Gilbert v. California, </em><a href="/us/388/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="388 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="6168184" data-case-paths="/us/388/0263-01">388 U.S. 263</a>, <a href="/us/388/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="388 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="6168184" data-case-paths="/us/388/0263-01">87 S.Ct. 1951</a>, <a href="/us/388/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="388 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="6168184" data-case-paths="/us/388/0263-01">18 L.Ed.2d 1178</a> (1967), the defendant was placed in a lineup in which each person was required to put on or take off certain articles of clothing. Each person in the lineup was also required to <a id="p1271" href="#p1271" data-label="1271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1271</a>repeat certain phrases that the witnesses had heard the robbers use. In neither case did the Supreme Court consider the lineup or anything the accused was required to do in the lineup to be unnecessarily suggestive or as being a denial of due process. The fact that the accused were required to repeat words spoken by the perpetrators of the crimes was held not to be viola-tive of their Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination.</p>
