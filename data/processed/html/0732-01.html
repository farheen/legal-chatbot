After leaving the premises on request, they returned to the area approximately an hour later, when the Boyce brothers were about to leave. A melee took place at that time wherein Arthur Boyce received some bodily injury. The appellant testified that he did take a swing at Arthur Boyce, but denied that he had anything in his hand. He was corroborated in this by the defense witnesses, while Arthur Boyce, his brother Thomas and Denise King all testified that the appellant was swinging with a piece of wood’ variously labelled a bat, club or stick. The alleged weapon was admitted in evidence, but the exhibit was not transmitted to the Law Court in specie, and there is no testimonial evidence respecting the size of the wooden object. Arthur Boyce did testify that one of appellant’s companions struck him in the face, although he denied that this specific blow was to his nose. He further stated that, as a result of this affray, he suffered a broken nose and head lacerations, two black eyes and bruises; although transported to the local hospital and seen by a doctor, <a id="p737" href="#p737" data-label="737" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*737</a>Boyce was not hospitalized. He did say that for several weeks his nose ached “an awful lot.”</p>
    <p id="b801-5" data-blocks='[["BL_801.4",801,[135,446,752,1421]]]'>As mentioned previously, the appellant was not charged with aggravated assault based on the infliction of bodily injury with use of a dangerous weapon. He was accused of causing “serious bodily injury” to Arthur Boyce. Except for the jury’s inspection of the wooden object allegedly used in the assault and the presence of Arthur Boyce before them and Boyce’s own testimony, from all of which a jury could possibly infer a substantial impairment of the function of his nose, there was no other evidence that the bodily injury sustained in the fracas “created a substantial risk of death” or “caused a serious, permanent disfigurement” or any “extended convalescence.” In view of the character of the injury, a broken nose, which did not require hospitalization and which, in the words of the victim himself without medical support, was described as giving him trouble for several weeks and caused a great amount of pain, the jury might well have concluded that the resulting bodily injury was not the “serious bodily injury” within the definition provided by 17-A M.R.S.A., § 2(23), and, if permitted to do so by the instructions, they might well have reached a verdict of guilty of simple assault under 17-A M.R.S.A., § 207.</p>
