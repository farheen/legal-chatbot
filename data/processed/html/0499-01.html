Cianei, Jr., the mayor of the City of Providence, and Local No. 1033 of the Laborers’ International Union of America (local No. 1033), from a declaratory judgment issued by the Superior Court. The plaintiff appeals the trial justice’s determination that section 17-27 of the Providence Code of Ordinances (§ 17-27), providing for ratification by the council of collective-bargaining agreements entered into between the city and any labor organization, is void and unenforceable. The defendants appeal the trial justice’s finding that appropriation ordinance No. 401 limiting collective-bargaining agreements to one year is valid and within the purview of council authority. For the following reasons we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>

On February 28, 1992, the mayor submitted five collective-bargaining agreements to the city council for ratification, and for the first time, the council rejected one. On July 27, 1992, the city council passed an appropriation ordinance specifically proscribing the mayor’s authority to enter into any labor contract with any labor union for a term greater than one year. On October 7, 1992, the mayor signed a collective-bargaining agreement with local No. 1033 for a three-year term. On October 15, 1992, the city council passed a resolution requesting the mayor to forward the contract with the union to the city council in accordance with the ratification ordinance. The mayor refused to submit the contract.</p>

The city council joined as parties local No. 1033 and the city of Providence. On April 5, 1993, a Superior Court trial justice held the collective-bargaining agreement between local No. 1033 and the city of Providence to be valid, binding, and enforceable, and found § 17-27 to be inconsistent with and superseded by G.L.1956 (1986 Reenactment) § 28-9.4-5.</p>

The modified order was based on the city council’s passage of ordinance No. 401, which restricted collective-bargaining agreements entered into by the mayor to a term of one year. The trial justice reaffirmed his order that § 17-27 was inconsistent with Rhode Island law.</p>

    <p id="b559-8" data-blocks='[["BL_559.8",559,[986,240,754,623]]]'>The defendants first contend that § 17-27 is inconsistent with § 903(o) of the Providence Home Rule Charter. Section 903(o) states that the director of personnel shall “[a]id the mayor in all negotiations with collective bargaining units.” There is no merit in defendants’ argument that since the mayor may participate in labor negotiations, the city council is precluded from ratifying agreements produced from such negotiations. In fact § 903(o) in no way confers or denies authority to ratify collective-bargaining agreements.</p>

A state statute preempts a local ordinance only when the Legislature manifests a clear intent to do so or when the statute and the ordinance are in clear conflict. <em>Powers ex rel. McGowan v. Jocelyn, </em><a href="/ri/83/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="83 R.I. 487" data-case-ids="5127431" data-case-paths="/ri/83/0487-01">83 R.I. 487</a>, 494, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.2d%20143" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="120 A.2d 143">120 A.2d 143</a>, 147 (1956). Section 28-9.4-3 states that “[t]he municipal employees of any municipal employer in any city, town or regional school district, shall have the right to negotiate and to bargain collectively with their respective municipal employers and to be represented by an employee organization in such negotiation or collective bargaining concerning hours, salary, working conditions and all other terms and conditions of employment.” Section 28-9.4-5 provides in part that “[i]t shall be the obligation of the municipal employer to meet and confer in good faith with the representative or representatives of the negotiating or bargaining agent * * *. This obligation shall include the duty to cause any agreement resulting from negotiation or bargaining to be reduced to a written contract, provided that no such contract shall exceed the term of three (3) years.” The defendants argue that § 17-27 sharply lessons the may- or’s power to participate in collective bargaining effectively because it undermines the mayor’s statutory mandate to negotiate with municipal unions in good faith. The defendants argue that since the council has the final power of ratification, the mayor cannot in good faith commit the negotiated agreement in writing to evidence a binding con<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>tract. We are not persuaded by defendants’ argument.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[200,336,758,1025]]]'>We agree with the city council that neither § 28-9.4-3 nor § 28-9.4-5 addresses any issue concerning ratification of municipal contracts. It was conceded by defendants that the municipal-employees’ union ratified the contract entered into by its bargaining agent, and it is the union’s practice to routinely ratify contracts entered into on its behalf. We are of the opinion that it would be ludicrous for the union membership to have the right to ratify labor contracts while that same right is denied to the city council. This court has stated that when the validity of an ordinance is at issue, the court must, if possible interpret the ordinance as valid. <em>Greenwich Bay Yacht Basin Associates v. Washburn, </em><a href="/a2d/560/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="560 A.2d 945" data-case-ids="7354364,7354483" data-case-paths="/a2d/560/0945-01,/a2d/560/0945-02">560 A.2d 945</a> (R.I.1989). The city council has the clear authority to enact the ordinance in question. Since § 17-27 is valid, the contract entered into between the mayor and local No. 1033 is void and unenforceable.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[194,1397,762,1220]]]'>The defendants also argue that the city council is without authority to limit the duration of labor contracts to one-year terms. The question exists whether this argument is properly before this court because plaintiff failed to address this issue in its original complaint. However, because this issue is a matter of great public interest, we shall waive the procedural defects and consider it at this time. The defendants assert that the limitation on the length of any collective-bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the state mandate authorizing negotiators to agree for a period not to exceed three years as set forth in § 28-9.4-5. We do not agree with defendants’ interpretation of § 28-9.4-5. They assert that the statute specifically permits contracts with municipal employees to be up to three years in duration. The statute in question, § 28-9.4-5, reads that- “no such contract shall exceed the term of three (3) years.” It is this court’s determination that a one-year contract fits within the parameters of the statute, and we shall not question the city council’s authority to enact such an ordinance.</p>

In the same vein we are of the opinion that the city council is endowed with the legislative power to ratify collective-bargaining agreements in order to manage the budgetary affairs of the city. In <em>Warwick Teachers </em>we addressed the issue of whether one or more members of a negotiating team may bind a school committee in contravention of specific instructions limiting their authority. <a href="/a2d/624/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="624 A.2d 849" data-case-ids="7361792" data-case-paths="/a2d/624/0849-01">624 A.2d at 851</a>. We were not persuaded by the argument of the teachers’ union that negotiators must be given complete authority to bind the principal if bargaining in good faith is to be effective. <em><a href="/a2d/624/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="624 A.2d 849" data-case-ids="7361792" data-case-paths="/a2d/624/0849-01">Id.</a> </em>In. <em>Warwick Teachers </em>this court recognized the history of ratification of contracts entered into between the school committee and the teachers union; likewise, this court will not ignore the history of ratification of contracts entered into between the city and its municipal employees.</p>
    <p id="b560-8" data-blocks='[["BL_560.8",560,[996,1795,756,938]]]'>The defendants assert that this court’s decision in <em>Exeter-West Greenwich Regional School District v.
