He stated that after receiving a report of a disorderly group congregating at an office complex on Recktor Avenue he proceeded to the location to investigate. Upon arrival Officer Heidenreich observed a pickup truck, later determined to be registered in Hall’s name, with two flat tires. Hall admitted to the officer that he had been driving the pickup truck and had caused the damage to the grassy area in front of the office complex. The officer also testified that Hall stated “let’s get the hell out of here, you .know I was driving.” (Reproduced Record, p. 4.) Officer Heidenreich further stated that Hall’s eyes were glassy, his face was flushed and that he had a strong odor of alcohol about his person. The officer also indicated that he was aware that another officer had observed Hall driving at the Craf-ton-Ingram Shopping Center approximately one to two hours prior to the incident on Recktor Avenue.</p>

Hall’s statement of the law as set forth in <em>Fierst </em>and <em>Mulholland </em>is correct; a police officer may not have reasonable grounds to request a chemical test to determine blood-alcohol content when a period of time elapses between the time a motorist is observed driving a vehicle and a subsequent point in time wherein a police officer sees an individual consuming alcohol but is not in control of his vehicle. However, the facts here are distinguishable. Hall presented no evidence that he consumed alcohol after being observed driving and before he encountered Officer Heidenreieh. Hall cannot choose to argue only the facts surrounding the circumstances in this case that support his contention and disregard other facts presented.</p>
