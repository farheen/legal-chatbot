The defendants are the town of Foster, the Foster-Glocester School Committee, and the Foster representatives on the regional school committee. O’Connors brought this action in the Superior Court, claiming that the regional committee, as it is currently composed, does not meet the constitutional requirements of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (the equal-protection clause). The plaintiff also alleges a violation of G.L. 1956 (1981 Reenactment) § 16-3-7.1, which provides that all regional school committees are to be selected from “voting districts as nearly equal in population as is practicable within each town in the district, and member towns in such districts shall be entitled to representation on such school committee in proportion to their population.”</p>

The individual school committees in their respective towns preside over grades kindergarten through six. The regional committee governs grades six through twelve.
