The Court has stated that “may” in a statute will not be construed to mean “shall” unless the context or subject matters compel such construction or unless it is necessary to give effect to the clear policy and intention of the legislature. <em>In re Columbia Borough, </em>24 Pa.Cmwlth. 190, <a href="/citations/?q=354%20A.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="354 A.2d 277">354 A.2d 277</a> (1976),</p>

They see certification as certification only of a condition, <em>e.g. </em>alcohol dependency, and referral for “appropriate treatment” as meaning a setting such as non-hospital residential. Insurers cite the principle that in construing a statute a court may not supply omissions. <em>See Almy v. Borough of Wilkinsburg, </em>53 Pa.

The ■ definition of “Health care service” in Section 2102, 40 P.S. § 991.2102, is: “Any covered treatment, admission, procedure, medical supplies and equipment or other services, including behavioral health, prescribed or otherwise provided or proposed to be provided by a health care provider to an enrollee under a managed care plan contract.” As used generally in the industry, “behavioral health” includes substance abuse.</p>

Sections 604-A and 605-A of Act 106 use such language, but Section 603-A does not.

In its brief in support of its motion and its brief in opposition, the Department asserts first that Act 106 unambiguously requires group health insurers to provide mandatory coverage for alcohol and drug abuse treatment once an insured receives a certification and referral from a licensed physician or psychologist. Section 602-A of Act 106, in its general requirement for all group health or accident insurance policies, in subsection (d) expressly excludes only Medicare or Medicaid supplemental contracts or certain limited coverage policies.</p>

The definition of “detoxification” in Section 601-A acknowledges that the process poses physiological risks. Inpatient detoxification must take place in a hospital or inpatient non-hospital facility affiliated with a hospital and licensed, Section 603-A(a), and the determination that it is necessary is inherently medical. Moreover, use of the phrase “[bjefore an insured may qualify” in Sections 604-A and 605-A merely indicates that there is a condition precedent before the insured may receive Act 106 benefits. In this context the word “may” is used to signify the need for permission. American Heritage Dictionary (2d College ed.1991). In <em>Columbia Borough </em>the statute plainly indicated discretion, stating that a court “may” abolish wards upon petition, but the legislature made no such indication here.</p>
    <p id="b1297-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1297.8",1297,[955,1103,755,975]]]'>In both of its briefs, the Department argues that there is no managed care exception to Act 106. It asserts that Insurers’ contention that they should play a role in balancing cost against medical necessity for Act 106 benefits ignores that the legislature already determined the appropriate balance by limiting the number of days or sessions of treatment that must be provided. The legislature was aware of the managed care concept when Act 106 was adopted. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) had been in existence and licensed since 1972, yet the legislature in Section 602-A made HMOs subject to Act 106 along with other insurers. The legislature did address the cost concerns raised by Insurers in a different way, and it also limited Act 106 coverage to group policies.</p>

Any conflict between statutes is to be avoided if possible, and apparently conflicting parts must be construed together with the more specific prevailing over the more general ones. <em>Housing Authority of Chester County v.

    <p id="b1298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1298.5",1298,[192,775,757,1162]]]'>The Department asserts that Act 68 is a consumer protection statute intended to protect the consumers from misguided applications of managed care principles that value the bottom line over quality health care and that it would be a distortion of Act 68 to read it as granting total discretion, to managed care organizations to override mandated Act 106 benefits. Furthermore, Insurers are incorrect in contending that MCPs are solely responsible to determine whether benefits are “medically necessary.” The Department contrasts mandated benefits for serious mental illness (also part of “behavioral health”) under Section 636.1 of the Insurance Company Law, added by Section 5 of the Act of December 21, 1998, P.L. 1108, 40 P.S. § 764g, which does not specify who must make determinations of medical necessity; therefore, prescriptions for treatment are subject to review under Act 68 for medical necessity.</p>

MCPs would be permitted to second-guess the legislature concerning whether any mandated benefit is medically necessary. For example, mandated coverage for yearly mammograms for women age forty or over pursuant to Section 632 of the Insurance Company Law, added by Section 4 of the Act of July 7, 1989, P.L. 755, 40 P.S. § 764c, could be effectively eliminated if an insurer determined that they were not medically necessary. To allow MCPs to determine whether mandated benefits are ever necessary would contravene the provision of Article II, Section 1 vesting the legislative power in the General Assembly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Additionally, Notice 2003-06 was not required to be promulgated as a regulation as Insurers argue because it does not establish a binding norm; it simply interprets existing law.</p>

The Court certainly agrees with the Department that the definition of “detoxification” as a process in a licensed facility where a person is assisted in eliminating alcohol and/or other drugs “as determined by a licensed physician, while keeping the physiological risk to the patient at a minimum,” Section 603-A(a), is the equivalent of certification by a physician and referral for appropriate treatment. This constitutes the determination of “medical necessity.” The Court also agrees that Act 106 plainly provides for mandatory benefits and that nothing solely on its face, apart from certification and <a id="p1251" href="#p1251" data-label="1251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1251</a>referral, limits the availability of mandatory benefits by any extraneous procedures.</p>
    <p id="b1299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1299.5",1299,[168,363,752,713]]]'>Insurers’ position regarding utilization review of a decision to proceed with inpatient detoxification is illustrative. Although such a decision is inherently medical and time-sensitive, and the statutory definition of detoxification in Section 601-A expressly requires that the process be determined by a licensed physician, Insurers assume a right under Act 68 for an MCP gatekeeper to determine that the procedure is not medically necessary and to overrule the licensed physician. The Court does not consider this to be what the legislature intended.</p>

That section provides that in case of conflict a more specific provision prevails over a more general one, unless the more general one was enacted later “and it shall be the manifest intention of the General Assembly that such general provision shall prevail.” Here Act 106 is a specific provision addressing only drug and alcohol dependency coverage, and Act 68 is a general provision applicable to managed care generally. Insurers have shown nothing in Act 68 expressing a manifest intention of the legislature that it shall prevail over Act 106 procedures already in place. Insurers concede that Act 68 does not supersede all statutory provisions for decisions to be made by doctors, as in length of hospital stay following mastectomy in 40 P.S. § 764d, and the Court considers the requirements of Act 106 in regard to mandatory drug and alcohol treatment coverage to be equivalent.</p>

At issue here are mandatory benefits specifically directed in a statute to be provided upon certification and referral by a licensed physician and/or a psychologist. Nor are Insurers correct that Notice 2003-06 leads to absurd and unreasonable results. In the event of a referral lacking the necessary guidance or a referral where the treating physician disagrees as to type or duration of treatment, it is reasonable to expect that the referring physician or psychologist and the treating physician will cooperate in developing an individualized patient treatment plan.</p>
