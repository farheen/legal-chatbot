Gina Ballot, as third-party defendant, appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict for PT Petro on its third-party indemnification and contribution claim. Ballot, as plaintiff, appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict for PT Petro on Ballot’s claim for damages. The issues raised on appeal include the presence of a non-U.S. citizen on the jury, improper jury instructions, and the sufficiency of the evidence. We affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b1405-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1405.15",1405,[968,740,756,1466]]]'>These actions arise from an accident on August 27, 1989 on the Maine Turnpike involving a tractor trailer truck driven by Kenneth Crosby (“truck driver”) and a van driven by Ballot. Alan Jon Harris was a passenger in the van. PT Petro employed the truck driver and leased the truck from Lily.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The record discloses the following testimony: The truck driver testified that as he approached an exit, an automobile in front of him appeared to exit but then braked quickly and veered back in front of his truck. The truck driver signalled with his left blinker three to five times and made an abrupt move into the passing lane. One witness testified that he saw the van increase in speed a little bit about the time the truck’s blinker went on. When the truck moved suddenly into the passing lane, the van was located in the passing lane adjacent to the truck’s rear wheels. Ballot testified that she “felt some kind of impact” but was unsure. Two witnesses testified that the truck came within less than a foot of the van. Ballot drove into the median strip and then forced the wheel to the right, causing the van to cut back across the highway, hitting a bank, and flipping over. Both Ballot and Harris were taken to the hospital.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The truck driver, who continued driving, testified that he did not realize an accident had occurred.</p>

PT Petro filed a third-party complaint against Ballot as driver of the van. Ballot brought a separate action against PT Petro for damages. The two cases were consolidated.
