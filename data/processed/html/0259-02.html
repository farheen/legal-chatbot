    <p id="b313-28" data-blocks='[["BL_313.24",313,[992,1101,752,277]]]'>This case came before a hearing panel of this court for oral argument on October 19, 1993, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the defendants’ appeal of a Superior Court judgment in favor of plaintiff should not be summarily decided.</p>
    <p id="b313-29" data-blocks='[["BL_313.25",313,[990,1412,750,373]]]'>Lucille Tancrell (plaintiff) sustained a fractured ankle when she fell on a common-area stairway on premises owned by Andre and Susan Mongeon (defendants). A jury returned a verdict in the amount of $67,000 for the plaintiff, following which defendants moved for a new trial under Rule 69 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
    <p id="b313-30" data-blocks='[["BL_313.26",313,[991,1819,748,173]]]'>After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and after hearing the arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown.</p>
    <p id="b313-31" data-blocks='[["BL_313.27",313,[988,2034,752,507]]]'>The jury verdict obviously took into account the plaintiffs unexpectedly long hospitalization when a fever developed after surgery on her ankle. We concur with the trial justice’s finding that the jury had “clearly considered the evidence carefully * * * and their verdict reflected a very even-handed approach to both parties.” The defendants’ objection to the size of the jury award could have been addressed with a motion for remit-titur.</p>
    <p id="b313-32" data-blocks='[["BL_313.28",313,[992,2581,748,183]]]'>We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in admitting into evidence the plaintiffs medical affidavits and plaintiffs expert’s testimony.</p>

      <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>Consequently, the defendants’ appeal is denied and dismissed and the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>
