Following a pretrial hearing, a Superior Court trial justice granted Briggs’s motion to suppress statements made by Briggs when questioned by members of the Rhode Island State Police at the New Hampshire State Police Headquarters, and to suppress introduction at trial of evidence found in a trash bag seized from a dumpster on property Briggs owned in New Hampshire.

There, Patricia Jacques (Mrs. Jacques), was discovered lying fatally shot near the property’s adjacent stables. During a search of the crime scene, a handwritten note addressed to “Chester” was found. The note contained the defendant’s fax number and requested an explanation concerning the return of money belonging to the victim. The ensuing homicide investigation revealed that Mrs. Jacques previously had entrusted approximately $80,000 to the defendant for safekeeping. The investigation further revealed that the defendant visited Mrs. Jacques’s residence on the night before the murder and left a note indicating that he probably would return the next day. In addition, two witnesses saw a pickup truck similar to one owned by the defendant leave the general crime-scene area shortly after they heard gunshot sounds.</p>
    <p id="b767-5" data-blocks='[["BL_767.5",767,[145,1558,753,725]]]'>Two days later, on February 21, 1997, members of the Rhode Island State Police and the Tiverton Police decided to visit and speak with the defendant at his residence at 111 Kaime Road in Chichester, New Hampshire. Upon arriving in New Hampshire, the Rhode Island police were joined by a member of the New Hampshire State Police, and they went to the defendant’s residence. Once there, they encountered Robert Courtemanche (Cour-temanche), a neighbor and tenant of the defendant, who lived at 109 Kaime Road. Courtemanche told the police that Briggs was not home.</p>
    <p id="b767-6" data-blocks='[["BL_767.6",767,[146,2313,751,138]],["BL_767.7",767,[943,251,754,587]]]'>Shortly thereafter, the police, while waiting for Briggs to return, observed Courtemanche drive away in the defendant’s pickup truck.

    <p id="b767-12" data-blocks='[["BL_767.11",767,[945,885,753,731]]]'>Soon afterward, at approximately 7 p.m., the defendant arrived home accompanied by a friend, Norman Cease (Cease). Detective Corporal Elwood Johnson, Jr.,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (Detective Johnson), Detective Nicholas Telia (Detective Telia) of the Rhode Island State Police and a member of the New Hampshire State Police greeted the defendant and offered him their condolences on the loss of his friend, Mrs. Jacques. After the detectives told him that they were conducting a homicide investigation and that they wanted to ask him some questions, the defendant invited the detectives into his home.</p>
    <p id="b767-13" data-blocks='[["BL_767.12",767,[945,1663,754,780]],["BL_768.1",768,[219,243,751,278]]]'>Inside his home, the defendant told the police that on February 18, 1997, he had been to the Jacques’s home to give Mrs. Jacques $5,000. He revealed that she had called him the next day (the morning of her murder), and he volunteered to show the police his telephone caller ID box. He informed them that he kept a gun in the house and allowed the police to inspect it. Approximately fifteen minutes later, the detectives asked the defendant to accompany them to the New Hampshire State Police Headquarters (police station) for questioning. The defendant readily agreed. The defendant and the police then left the defendant’s home in three <a id="p734" href="#p734" data-label="734" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*734</a>separate vehicles. The New Hampshire state trooper drove alone to the police station. Cease and the defendant drove in Cease’s vehicle, and the Rhode Island detectives, in a third car, followed Cease and the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b768-4" data-blocks='[["BL_768.4",768,[211,551,757,971]]]'>At the police station, they were met by Corporal Russell Conte (Corporal Conte) from the New Hampshire State Police. The defendant was brought into a small room, and Cease remained in the hallway. Before the questioning began, the defendant was informed that he was a suspect in the Jacques homicide investigation and was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> He read aloud the <em>Miranda </em>rights police form, and then initialed and signed the form indicating that he understood all his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He additionally signed two written police consent forms in which he consented to the search of both his residence and his pickup truck. Subsequently, the defendant was questioned for approximately twelve to thirteen hours, six and three-quarter hours of which were tape-recorded.</p>
    <p id="b768-5" data-blocks='[["BL_768.5",768,[209,1553,755,1130]],["BL_768.6",768,[1020,245,749,242]]]'>During the course of the questioning, the defendant casually and readily explained his relationship with the victim and her two children, Ronald and Robin Seav-ey. Apparently, he .met Mrs. Jacques some sixteen or seventeen years earlier, when her son Ronald was placed with him in foster care after becoming a ward of the State of New Hampshire. He explained that Mrs. Jacques and her husband previously had suffered financial difficulties and had given him approximately $100,000 of their assets to conceal from their creditors and from the Internal Revenue Service. Once their financial difficulties had been cleared, the defendant said he began returning their money to them at various intervals. He stated that he had returned the final installment of $5,000 in cash on the night before the murder by leaving it, and a note, in an envelope under the front seat of Mrs. Jacques’s car. He claimed that Mrs. Jacques called him on the following day to thank him. The defendant stated that he first learned that she had been murdered when Ronald called him at approximately 10:30 p.m., on Thursday, February 20, 1997, the day after the murder.</p>
    <p id="b768-8" data-blocks='[["BL_768.9",768,[1017,514,752,329]]]'>During the course of the questioning by Detectives Johnson and Telia, they made numerous references to the defendant’s sexual orientation and habits, his closet homosexuality, and his alleged sexual relationship with Ronald when Ronald was a minor.</p>
    <p id="b768-9" data-blocks='[["BL_768.10",768,[1013,879,753,830]]]'>At the suppression hearing, Detectives Johnson and Telia conceded that the majority of their unrecorded conversations with Briggs did, in fact, relate to sexual matters. The taped and recorded portion of the questioning also reveals that the detectives again asked the defendant many questions relating to those same matters. Such questions included: what kind of sex he participated in, with whom did he have sex, and whether he and Ronald were circumcised. During the thirteen hours of questioning, however, the defendant repeatedly denied any involvement in the murder and made numerous statements intended to exculpate himself from the homicide.</p>
    <p id="b768-10" data-blocks='[["BL_768.11",768,[1008,1745,765,933]],["BL_769.1",769,[138,246,750,137]]]'>The record also reveals that the questioning of the defendant took place in a small room containing only a table, several chairs and a telephone. Although several breaks of varying duration were taken during the questioning, the defendant never was left alone, and when he went to the bathroom, he always was accompanied by' an officer. Briggs’s bathroom visits, it appears, actually were prompted by suggestion of the police. During the questioning, the defendant was offered food and drink, but he declined it. As the questioning progressed, the defendant, several times, began to inform the detectives that he was tired; however, at no time did he ever request a break or ask them to interrupt or to stop the questioning, and there is no evidence in the record to show that <a id="p735" href="#p735" data-label="735" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*735</a>the defendant ever asked for an attorney. His one request was to make a telephone call, and that request readily was granted.</p>
    <p id="AWAQ" data-blocks='[["BL_769.4",769,[138,405,766,380]]]'>It appears from the tape recordings of the questioning that the defendant always assumed that he would be released at the conclusion of the questioning, and he went so far as to offer to allow the Rhode Island State police detectives to sleep over at his . house in New Hampshire before returning to Rhode Island.</p>
    <p id="AD0" data-blocks='[["BL_769.5",769,[139,816,751,635]]]'>At his pretrial motion hearing, the defendant moved to suppress all the statements that he made both while at his home and when later questioned at the police station. In addition, he moved to suppress the admission of the contents of the trash bag that the police had seized from the dumpster in the parking lot of the Pitts-field property that he owned. The defendant asserted that New Hampshire law, certainly favorable to him, should be applied by the trial justice in determining his suppression motions.</p>

He then granted the defendant’s motion, suppressed all the statements the defendant made at the police station, and precluded admission at trial of the contents of the trash bag. He denied, however, the defendant’s motion to suppress all his non-police-station statements. These appeals followed.</p>

The defendant, apparently believing that the state would not be able to meet New Hampshire’s higher standard of proof in determining the admissibility of his statements, contends that the law of that jurisdiction should have been applied.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> He contends that his constitutional rights were violated when he made his statements in New Hampshire, and that New Hampshire had a greater interest in the outcome of the hearing because the statements were taken in that state, where he, the decedent’s children, and many of the witnesses in the case resided.

The defendant specifically knew that if he placed trash in the bed of his pickup truck, Courtemanche, in accordance with their agreement, probably would throw the trash into the unlocked and open communal dumpster in Pittsfield, where it would be available to anyone curious enough to look into the dumpster and to take the bag for whatever reason they might have for doing so. Nevertheless, notwithstanding this knowledge, the defendant, placed the contested trash bag into the bed of his pickup truck. In doing so, he effectively abandoned his subjective expectation of privacy, and any expectation of privacy that later he asserted was objectively unreasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
