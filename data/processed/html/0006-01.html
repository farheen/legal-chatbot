On appeal, appellants claim that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute for each of their nine claims arising out of the termination of Lawrence Elliott's employment with the Grant Park Center. These claims are: breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith, abusive discharge, defamation, public disclosure of private facts, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, civil conspiracy, and loss of consortium. Substantially for the same reasons articulated by the trial court, we find that there are no genuine issues of material fact, and that appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In May 1988, Cynthia Martin, Administrator for the Center, hired appellant, Lawrence Oliver Elliott (“Elliott”) as Chief Technician. Elliott’s employment was confirmed by a letter dated May 26, 1988, stating the hours and salary, which he signed. There was no written contract. Elliott’s duties, as described in the Center’s Personnel Manual, were to “[pjerform preventive maintenance on all machines and ancillary equipment, including maintaining records” and “[rjepair or arrange for repair of defective equipment.”</p>

Elliott was told he was being terminated, but he was given an opportunity to resign by the end of the day. When Elliott did not resign, he was terminated on July 20, 1990. Elliott’s claim for unemployment compensation, filed on July 28, 1990, was opposed on August 3, 1990, by Healthcare and the Center who listed the reason for Elliott’s discharge as “gross negligence in [the] performance of duties that presented] a threat to patient [life].”</p>
