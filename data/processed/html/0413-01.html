Second, whether Mr. Lee’s “physical pain or injury,” discussed <em>infra, </em>was intentionally or knowingly inflicted by appellant, was proven at trial. The evidence reveals that appellant forced Mr. Lee to the ground, placed his knee into his back, and refused to let Mr. Lee up despite his repeated requests. A finding by this Court that these actions were not an intentional or knowing infliction of “physical pain or injury” would be in conflict with the facts that we have before us, which we will not disturb on appeal. <em>See Hill v.

Further, both Ms. Odejobi and Ms. Fmuditi, employees of CareCo, corroborated Mr. Lee’s testimony and testified that they each saw a contusion on Mr. Lee’s lip and an abrasion to his right knee.

Specifically, appellant claims that his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses called against him was violated when the trial judge refused to allow his trial counsel to recall Mr. Lee to the witness stand after a faded attempt to elicit from another witness, Ms. Elliot, a prior inconsistent statement Mr. Lee allegedly made to her about the April 21, 2004 incident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

After the government’s direct examination of Mr. Lee, appellant’s trial counsel conducted an extensive cross examination of Mr. Lee and inquired into the events surrounding April 21, 2004 — particularly about the alleged prior inconsistent statement Mr. Lee made to Ms. Elliot about the events on this day. When appellant’s trial counsel was unsuccessful in eliciting this statement from Ms. Elliot because the trial court sustained a hearsay objection, defense counsel sought to bring Mr. Lee back to the witness stand to confront him about the alleged prior inconsistent statement. The trial court refused to recall Mr. Lee, finding that defense counsel “had every opportunity to explore with Mr. Lee the nature of the circumstances that were involved” in the April 21, 2004 incident during cross examination.</p>

Appellant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to hold a full competency hearing on Mr. Lee’s mental status. At the conclusion of voir dire, the trial court found Mr. Lee competent to testify at trial. “The decision whether to order a physical or psychiatric examination for the purpose of determining competency to testify or to aid the jury in its assessment of a witness’ credibility is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.” <em>Hilton v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/435/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="435 A.2d 383" data-case-ids="7984428" data-case-paths="/a2d/435/0383-01">435 A.2d 383</a>, 387-388 (D.C.1981).

Guided by these legal principles, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in finding that Mr. Lee understood his duty to tell the truth and had the capacity to recall, albeit with some difficulty, the events surrounding the April 21, 2004 incident.</p>
