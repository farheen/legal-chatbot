The Township argues that the ZHB abused its discretion and/or committed an error of law by granting Applicant a variance without presenting any evidence of hardship as required under Section 910.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, <em>as amended, </em>added by Section 89 of the Act of December 21, 1988, P.L. 1329, 53 P.S. § 10910.2. It also argues that prior to granting the variance the ZHB should have required Applicant to seek a conditional reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of required parking spaces from the Board of Supervisors pursuant to Section 140-49(C) of the Zoning Code.</p>

Applicant plans to lease the Property from its owners to construct and operate the Rite Aid. The Property is situated in the Township’s C-2 General Commercial/ Office Zoning District where the proposed Rite Aid is a permitted use. Section 140-49 of the Zoning Code requires one parking space for every 100 square feet of floor area for properties qualifying as a “retail use.” The Rite Aid will have total gross floor area of 11,153 square feet and will require 112 off-street parking spaces to comply.</p>

Mark Heeb (Heeb), a landscape architect, testified for Applicant that based upon his experience with similar retail store pharmacies only 50-70 parking spaces are needed during the periods of heaviest use and that the smaller number of spaces would reduce storm water runoff on the Property and increase green space, which would improve the health and welfare of the community. He admitted that the parking specifications were based on Rite Aid’s prototype for a retail pharmacy and not on any existing features of the Property. The square footage of the building could not be reduced to allow for more parking because the building size was deemed necessary to provide the services that the community demands. Heeb opined that the Zoning Code was “pretty heavy with parking” and the requested variance could “set the standard [for a] common sense approach to parking....” Notes of Testimony (N.T.) at 71, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 87a.

The trial court also recognized that the additional spaces would cause an increase in impervious surface coverage on the Property.

The Township also characterizes Applicant’s claim that the parking requirements are unreasonable as a substantive validity challenge to the Zoning Code, which the MPC specifically states cannot be the basis for a variance.

    <p id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[193,1017,752,1059]]]'>Finally, the Township argues that the ZHB erred when it granted a variance without first requiring Applicant to seek a reduction in the number of parking spaces from the Board of Supervisors under Section 140-49(C) of the Zoning Code. This section enables the Supervisors to grant a conditional reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of required off-street parking spaces upon submission of an off-street parking study prepared by a qualified traffic engineer or transportation planner and the review and recommendation of the planning commission and Township engineer. The Township states that this process could have reduced the number of required parking spaces to 88 and further contends that the refusal to consider it shows that Applicant determined that its analysis should trump the Zoning Code provisions.</p>

Because this case involves a request for a dimensional variance, <em>Hertz-berg </em>directs that a more relaxed standard should be employed when analyzing the hardship.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Applicant recognizes that <em>Hertzberg </em>did not grant a free-for-all for dimensional zoning variances and that there still must be evidence of hardship, but it argues that the case broadened the parameters of factors that may be considered for determining hardship. The unre-futed testimony demonstrates that the variance requested is the minimum relief needed for the proposed store. The ZHB found that additional parking spaces could be located along the side of the Property but only with major modification and economic impact. Under <em>Hertzberg </em>analysis, the strict requirements of the Zoning Code therefore caused an unreasonable hardship to Applicant’s pursuit of a permitted use. Also, the additional parking spaces would create unnecessary impervious surface and reduce green space.</p>

For example, the applicant there requested a 300 percent increase in gross floor area over what was permitted in the zoning code. As for the argument that it should have sought a conditional reduction in parking spaces under Section 140-49(C) of the Zoning Code, Applicant posits that the requested number of spaces is not arbitrary because it is based upon experience with other Rite Aid facilities and that any reduction sought under Section 140-49(C) would provide only 88 spaces.</p>

The ZHB finding as to economic impact or financial hardship is Finding No. 21, which reads: “Additional parking spaces could be placed on the left side of the Property but only with a major modification and economic impact on the Applicant.” Neither of Applicant’s witnesses testified specifically about any economic impact or financial hardship to Applicant if it complied with parking requirements, and it identified no testimony or exhibits to support Finding No. 21.
