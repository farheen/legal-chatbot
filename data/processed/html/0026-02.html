During the course of the status hearing, he ran toward the public exit of the courtroom, refused to stop at the command of a Deputy United States Marshal, continued out the door and proceeded down the hall. When the deputy marshal tried to restrain him, he struggled to break loose. Two other marshals and a Metropolitan Police Department officer assisted in restraining Mr. Mills. For this attempt to flee the court, he was subsequently charged with a second escape count and convicted by a jury. He takes an appeal from the conviction based on the second escape charge.</p>

The record shows that prior to convening a jury panel for <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel informed the trial judge that: “Mr. Mills has requested that I ask the Court about the plea offer in this case.” The next several minutes were spent discussing the nature of the government’s plea offer, whether Mr. Mills understood the offer, and whether he wanted to accept it or go to trial. Defense counsel requested time to speak with Mr. Mills, which was granted. When the trial court resumed its consideration of Mr. Mills’ case, defense counsel stated, “I have questions as to whether or not Mr. Mills understands the offer.” Mr. Mills declared: “I understand what you’re saying but I don’t need any psychological evaluations to prove that I’m sane. Therefore, I keep having these attorneys that have a difference as to how to proceed about these matters.” After further discussion, the trial judge ascertained that Mr. Mills understood that if he went to trial that day, it would be on the charge of escape. She then posed the following question to Mr. Mills: “[H]ave you discussed that with [defense counsel]? ... I just want to know whether you discussed the case with him.” The trial judge, Mr. Mills and defense counsel then engaged in dialog:</p>

Moreover, the trial judge did ask a “catch-all” question of jurors who had stood for none of the questions posed during the first part of the process<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and also posed other questions designed to ferret out juror bias; for example:</p>
    <blockquote id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.6",88,[237,2139,714,240]]]'>Is there any member of the jury panel who is unable or unwilling to follow the Court’s instructions regarding the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence in this case?</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b88-10" data-blocks='[["BL_88.11",88,[1043,483,711,352]]]'>Are any of you now or have you in the past been members of a community, civic or other organization that’s actively involved in law enforcement issues, such as a neighborhood watch group, a police support organization, a victim’s assistance group, the Orange [caps]?</blockquote>
    <p id="b88-11" data-blocks='[["BL_88.12",88,[998,871,757,1081]]]'>On balance, the <em>voir dire </em>process used by the trial judge in Mr. Mills’ case was by no means perfunctory, hurried, or devoid of efforts to weed out juror bias. The trial judge, defense counsel, and government counsel all had the opportunity to pose questions to each member of the jury veni-re, out of the presence of other prospective jurors. Furthermore, unlike <em>Doret, <a href="/a2d/765/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="765 A.2d 47" data-case-ids="11075403" data-case-paths="/a2d/765/0047-01">supra,</a> </em>defense counsel did not advise the trial judge, before the <em>voir dire </em>process, of the specific question he wished to have posed to potential jurors. Nor is this a case, as in <em>Doret, </em>where a juror’s answer to a particular <em>voir dire </em>question required the judge not to accept silence to a follow-up question about the juror’s ability to be fair. Consequently, we see nothing in the record before us to suggest constitutional error or an abuse of discretion in the trial court’s handling of the <em>voir dire.</em>
