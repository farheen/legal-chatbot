Upon cross-examination, the witness was shown several bills of lading that did not contain the stipulation before mentioned. Some of these bills of lading were signed by him, and some by other steamboat captains and agents. The witness then explained that, by general or invariable custom, he meant that the regulations and instructions of the steamboat companies were that the bills of lading should contain a stipulation exempting the companies from liability for losses occasioned by fire. Upon being re-examined by defendants, the witness stated that he signed the bills of lading shown to him that did not contain the exemption from oversight or by mistake, and that he never would have signed them if he had noticed the fact that they did not contain the exemption. The witness further testified, that in the hurry and excitement of business, bills may have been signed that did not embody the exemption, but that it was always understood that the company were not to account for losses by fire; that merchants and shippers usually had their bill book and filled out the bills themselves, and the agents and officers of boats would often sign them without noticing their contents particularly.

This testimony was admitted over objection made thereto by plaintiff’s counsel. The witness also stated that, pursuant to these instructions, he did make out a bill of lading for the cotton, and placed it in the letter box of the boat, which was consumed by fire with the boat; that the bill of lading thus made out, did contain an exemption from loss by fire; that all precautions were used to prevent fire or accidents, such as pumps, hose, cisterns, and buckets, and that there were some thirty hands at work to extinguish the fire, but all to no avail. Upon cross-examination the witness stated, that he gave the receipt or memorandum hereinbefore copied, to Mrs. Boykin’s overseer, of one hundred and thirty-four bales, according to Col. Harper’s instructions to let her know which boat had taken the cotton, and it was not intended as a bill of lading; that all the bills of lading given on that trip of the boat contained a stipulation that the company <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>was not to make good any damage sustained by fire; that lie made out the bill of lading for one hundred bales shipped by Col. Harper, and thirty-three or four shipped by consent of Mrs. Boykin’s overseer, as he was at the river when the cotton was taken on board; that it was customary, on the river, for overseers to ship cotton; that on that trip the steamer Franklin had on board eleven hundred bales of cotton, whilst her capacity was thirteen hundred bales; that the fire by which the boat was consumed originated in the outside tier of cotton, just aft the ashpan, and on the larboard side; that the wind was blowing considerably, and the fire being on the outside tier of cotton the smoke was blown aft; that the fire occurred just after breakfast; that all hands, captain, mate, clerk, watchman and deck hands, were on watch; that the cotton near the engine was kept constantly wet with buckets of water kept for the purpose; that it was the uniform custom for all bills of lading given by the steamer Franklin, to contain the exemption from loss by fire, and all given to shipper's did contain such exemption, unless it resulted from oversight. The instructions, to the witness as clerk of the boat were, never to fail to put it in the bill of lading; that Col. Harper was a large shipper of cotton, and shipped frequently on the Franklin, and all the bills of lading given to him contained said exemption; that witness, as clerk of the Franklin, had given at least three or four thousand bills of lading, which contained the exemption relative to losses by fire.</p>

      <a class="bracketnum">3.</a> Again, error is charged in this, to-wit: that the Court admitted the books of Hall <em>&amp; </em>Moses, which contained receipts by the boat for sundry articles shipped by the river, on which there was no exemption of the kind contended for, Mr. Moses stating expressly that these receipts were not intended to be bills of lading, but were <em>memoranda </em>taken from the boat by the dray-men to show that the goods were delivered. We think the testimony should have been excluded, because it does not serve to elucidate the issue before the jury, to-wit: custom or no custom.</p>

      <a class="bracketnum">4.</a> Lastly, and mainly, it is complained of as error, that the Court charged the jury that if the contract was, that the carriers were to take one hundred bales of cotton only, and were not to take more than one hundred bales, and the carriers took more than one hundred, they violated the contract, and, there-</p>

Reference to the testimony of W. H. Harper will show that there was no evidence to warrant this charge, and that it is purely hypothetical, and as such, condemned by numerous decisions of this Court: 7 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>495; 8 <em>Ibid., </em>116. We have in the evidence the written order, signed by Colonel Harper, under which the cotton was received. Colonel Harper was the shipping agent of Mrs. Boy-kin. It is in these words:</p>
