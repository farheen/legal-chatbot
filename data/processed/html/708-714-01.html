Johnson testified that he was given a sedative and left in a darkened room where <em>he </em>subsequently awoke to find appellee performing oral sex upon him. Then, Shawn Wood testified that he was treated by appellee on June 13, 1994, for a head injury. During the examination, appellee allegedly placed his hand upon Wood’s genital area several times. Further, Wood testified that appellee took him to another room with less light to check the pupils of his eyes. During this portion of the examination, appellee again placed his hand upon Wood’s genital area, unzipped Wood’s pants, and placed Wood’s hand upon the doctor’s own penis which had been removed from his pants.</p>

In that meeting, Wood and appellee again discussed what had happened during the examination. Appellee claimed that the first touch was accidental, but offered no excuse for the remainder of his behavior. Then, appellee offered and Wood accepted $100 in exchange for a promise not to report the crime to the police. Secretly, appellee also, recorded this conversation.</p>

A hearing was held at which the parties initially stipulated that the transcript of the preliminary hearing, which included transcripts of the wire and oral interceptions, would be presented in lieu of additional testimony and exhibits. N.T., 3/9/95 at 3. During the hearing, however, the Commonwealth requested allowance to supplement the record at a later date with “the statements and affidavit required under the Wire Tap Act,” and if necessary, testimony of the people who prepared the documents. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 27. Appellee objected, and the trial judge stated that he would decide later whether such other evidence would be made a part of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 26. Consequently, the trial court denied the Commonwealth’s request to reopen the hearing, and granted several of appellee’s pretrial motions. Accordingly, the trial court granted appellee’s motions for severance of the charges; suppression of the wire interceptions taken on June 14 and June 29,1994; suppression of the oral interception taken on June 29, 1994; and suppression of the oral statements made by appellee to police.

While we disagree with appellant’s first contention, we agree with its second claim which necessarily renders the third claim moot.</p>
    <p id="b780-10" data-blocks='[["BL_780.10",780,[1003,1217,747,988]]]'>The Commonwealth’s first claim, that the trial court erred in suppressing ap-pellee’s oral statements made to police, fails. The Commonwealth argues that the statements made were not the product of a custodial interrogation; therefore, <em>Miranda </em>rights never attached to appellee and an explicit waiver of such rights was not necessary. Appellant’s brief at 10-11. Where the Commonwealth appeals the adverse decision of a suppression court, we must consider only the evidence of defense witnesses and so much of the prosecution’s evidence as remain uneon-tradicted. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Act specifically sets forth simple requirements (whether the interception be consensual or nonconsensual) necessary for the approval of the interception of communications. These guidelines were apparently not followed by the Commonwealth in this case, thus necessitating a more taxing inquiry into whether the conversation at issue fell within the definition of an “oral communication.” I echo the majority’s caution to the Commonwealth regarding the failure to obtain prior authorization under the Act; and further admonish the Commonwealth that a prior request and approval, in accordance with the Act, should be made before any interception is permitted to take place.</p>
