    <blockquote id="b48-4" data-blocks='[["BL_48.5",48,[224,532,1324,700]]]'>The device comprises a tubular housing or casing to be secured in the drill string directly above the drill bit. The casing is provided with aperatures or ports in its sidewall. A sleeve is slidably secured within the casing to be moved from a position closing the ports to a position opening them. A spring normally urges the sleeve to port closing position. In this position normal drilling operations may be carried on with the usual reverse flow of the drilling fluid. When washing action is desired a ball or plug is inserted in the drill string and the direction of flow of the drilling fluid is reversed. The pressure of the fluid forces the ball or plug into seating engagement with the sleeve and causes it to move to port opening position. The seating of the ball in the sleeve also cuts off the flow of drilling fluid through the bit and causes it to flow laterally from the ports in the tool wall. The fluid thus is directed against the walls of the well and washes down the debris and loose material. When the washing action is completed the direction of flow of the drilling fluid is restored to normal and the ball or plug is forced upwárdly in the drill string thus relieving the pressure on the sleeve which returns to its normal port closing position. The tool thus enables a washing action without the necessity of removing the drill string to change tools.</blockquote>

Fisher; that Fisher told him of some difficulties which were encountered in operating the reverse circulation method; that within twelve or eighteen hours after leaving the rig that clay, he conceived the. involved invention, and he later went back to the Beckman rig and described it to Fisher; that he1 drew a rough sketch of the invention on the back of an envelope and showed it to Fisher. This sketch was not produced, but at the hearing Appleby drew a sketch which he testified was similar, except as to proportions, to the sketch that he showed to Fisher.

Stanolind Oil and Gas Company, the general operation of the tool which he claims to have invented. His testimony upon this point is. as follows:</p>

We were charging much more than most of that type of equipment charges per day, for our work, though our total cost, in the end, was somewhat less than that of other equipment. I feel that Mr. Beckman expressed himself that he was of the opinion, that by using this tool, we would have some tool on the job which would run our time up on each job considerably more than it was, and make the cost probably more than the cost of other methods.</blockquote>

    <p id="b62-7" data-blocks='[["BL_62.7",62,[214,852,1330,797]]]'>We find thfit Beckman was a very loquacious witness who seemed to find it very difficult to directly and concisely answer questions propounded to him, making it difficult to sift out from his testimony matters -which are directly pertinent to the issues involved. It seems strange that if he really conceived the invention in 1933, as he claims, that he should have waited until 1938 to make complete drawings and construct a device embodying the invention. True, his explanation that in 1933 and for sometime thereafter his reverse circulation method for which he or his company owned patents had not been established commercially, and that he did not consider the invention here involved as of any special value except in connection with his reverse circulation, accounts for his inactivity during the early portion of the period between 1933 and the summer of 1938. But commercial success of the reverse circulation had been established early in 1937, and it would seem that if he was then in possession of the invention he would have proceeded to reduce it to practice, the need for it being apparent.</p>
    <p id="b62-8" data-blocks='[["BL_62.8",62,[210,1655,1327,686]]]'>On the other hand, it seems very unlikely that Appleby should have conceived the invention at the time stated by him, within twelve or eighteen hours after observing for a short time the operation of a rig employing the reverse circulation method. That he might have realized the desirability of a tool which accomplishes the result secured by the present invention seems very plausible, after Fisher’s statements to him about some defects in the reverse circulation method, but that he should have conceived every essential detail of the invention within that time seems improbable. It seems also very improbable that Fisher, his chief corroborating witness, should from recollection alone, four years after the event, have remembered every essential detail of the rather complicated device. The same observation is applicable to appellant’s other witnesses, Avho testified from recollection alone as to all the details of the invention.</p>
