(Employer). Claimant subsequently filed a claim petition for worker’s compensation benefits on November 22, 1988, alleging that his working conditions which included the physical stress of his job were the cause of his stroke. The petition was assigned to a referee by notice of assignment dated December 6, 1988. Employer’s answer to the claim petition was mailed on December 21, 1988, and received by the referee on December 22, 1988. At the initial hearing, held on March 15, 1989, Claimant objected to Employer’s answer on the grounds that it was untimely and requested that the referee decide the case based upon the claim petition and Claimant’s evidence alone. After holding that an answer was timely because it was filed on or before the hearing the referee permitted Employer to present a defense. In a decision dated December 21, 1989, the referee concluded that Claimant had failed to establish a causal connection between his work activities and his stroke and Claimant’s petition was resultantly dismissed. Claimant appealed to the Board which affirmed the referee’s decision and Claimant subsequently appealed to this Court. In an opinion dated February 6, 1992, this Court held that the referee’s findings of fact were insufficient and remanded for further findings as to the date Employer’s answer was filed and, if necessary, whether Employer had an adequate excuse for a late filing.</p>

Mrs. Piselle, a secretary at the law firm of Employer’s attorney, testified as to the regular practice of mailing documents at the law firm.

We find Employer’s argument unpersuasive. <em>Rockwood </em>concluded that a claim petition is filed when mailed based upon the proviso in section 315 of the Act which states that a petition must be filed “as provided in article four hereof.” 77 P.S. § 602. <em>Rockwood </em>further found that the “relevant section of article four is Section 403, 77 P.S. § 714, which provided: ‘all petitions ... shall be <em>mailed or delivered </em>to the department at its principle office.’” <em>Rockwood, </em><a href="/pa-commw/15/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="15 Pa.
