Appellant first argues that the affidavit filed in support of the search warrant for the Warren Street property did not provide probable cause to search. Appellant claims the affidavit was fatally flawed because it was based on information obtained from confidential informants who did not have a history of reliability, there was no showing of how the informants acquired their information, and the criminal information was not corroborated by independent police investigation. As a result, Appellant claims that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the Warren Street property. <em>See </em>Supplemental Brief for Appellant at 8. In his second issue, Appellant asserts that because the Warren Street property search was improper, the warrant obtained for the Sterigere Street property was unlawful as “fruit of a poisonous tree.” <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>

      <em>, </em>Therefore, we will review that case in detail. Torres was arrested and charged with three counts of homicide after the police found two guns and other incriminating items during a search of his apartment conducted pursuant to a warrant. Torres filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence found in his apartment, asserting that the warrant was not supported by probable cause. Following a hearing, the suppression court found that the affidavit of probable cause filed with the warrant application was “frustratingly sparse” in that it merely set forth in narrative form the information that the affiants had learned without clearly explaining where they obtained each piece of information. <em>See Torres, </em><a href="/a2d/764/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="764 A.2d 532" data-case-ids="11164461,1276824" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/0532-01,/pa/564/0086-01">764 A.2d at 538</a>. Further, the court found that there was no way for the issuing authority to tell from the affidavit how the anonymous sources cited therein had obtained their information.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Finally, the suppression court found that the only corroboration that imparted any reliability to the information obtained from the anonymous sources was the officers’ observations of a vehicle outside Torres’ apartment complex that matched the general description of the get-away car at the murder scene.

The Court rejected the Commonwealth’s claim that a commonsense reading of the affidavit indicated that at least one of the anonymous sources had personal knowledge of the events in question.

The affiant provided that on August 31, 2004, a confidential source advised Detective James Kelly of the Upper Moreland Police Department that the Warren Street property was abandoned and that marijuana plants were growing inside. That day, Detective Altieri went to the Warren Street property and found the property locked up, the windows covered, and the air conditioning unit on the second floor turned on. In addition, the back deck of the property was overgrown with weeds.

Nevertheless, the <a id="p1248" href="#p1248" data-label="1248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1248</a>scan revealed two air conditioners running on the second floor of the property.</p>

One of these sources stated that he/she smelled “skunk weed,” a term commonly used to describe home grown marijuana, coming from the Warren Street property. The other source informed the affiant that he/she personally saw marijuana growing inside the Warren Street property and that after the police began “snooping” around in late August, a person came and cleaned out overgrown weeds in the rear of the property and covered the windows more thoroughly.

For example, the affidavit specifically provided that one of the confidential sources told the affiant that he/she smelled “skunk weed,” and another source said they saw marijuana growing inside the Warren Street property. In addition, the veracity of the sources’ information was corroborated by independent police investigation. After the first anonymous tip on August 31, 2004, multiple law enforcement officers began periodic checks of the property. They saw the property as the multiple sources described it with windows covered and air conditioning units running inside. Furthermore, the officers attempted to conduct a thermal imaging scan of the property. Although the scan provided inconclusive results, it did reveal air conditioning units running inside the property in cold weather, as multiple sources had indicated to police. While the information that the officers corroborated was not necessarily criminal in nature, it was consistent with a marijuana growing operation. Finally, the information that was corroborated by the officers in this case was not “publicly available” in the same sense as the information corroborated by the affiant in <em>Torres, </em>who simply corroborated the source by looking in the phone book.</p>

The Common<a id="p1250" href="#p1250" data-label="1250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1250</a>wealth initially filed 23 separate Bills of Information charging Appellant with multiple violations of the Drug Act between the dates of March 5, 2003 and October 30, 2004. The location of these offenses was both the Warren Street and the Sterigere Street properties. The Commonwealth consolidated the charges into one Bill, number 9849.2, because all of the charges stemmed from a continuous course of conduct by Appellant. <em>See N.T., </em>3/29/03, at 25-30.</p>
    <p id="b1290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1290.4",1290,[183,949,751,521]]]'>¶ 27 Following his arrest, on October 27, 2004, Appellant made a statement to police in which he admitted that he had been growing and selling marijuana for over one and one-half years.

We disagree.</p>

In addition, the Commonwealth introduced numerous calendars that had been found during the search of Appellant’s properties. On these calendars, on specific dates, were handwritten notes indicating when plants were to be watered as well as projected harvesting dates and other information related to harvesting. These dates spanned from March 2003, through October 2004. Furthermore, the search of Appellant’s Warren and Sterigere Street properties revealed multiple marijuana plants at these locations. This combined evidence was certainly sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant was involved in an ongoing operation of growing marijuana. Therefore, the <em>corpus de-licti </em>was sufficiently proven and the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Appellant’s statement to police into evidence. Moreover, the combined evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant violated the Drug Act between March 2003 and October 2004. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not act erroneously or abuse its discretion in considering Appellant’s admission in reaching its verdict. <em>Reyes II.</em>

At the very least, Appellant’s statement to the police was related to his other drug charges on Bills 9849 and 9849.1. The <em>corpus delicti </em>for those charges is not in dispute. Therefore, because independent evidence established the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the other crimes charged, Appellant’s confession was properly considered as evidence for the closely related charges on Bill 9849.2. <em>Dupre.</em>
