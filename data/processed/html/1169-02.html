(Joseph), born on November 12, 1987, is the second oldest of the appellant-<a id="p1170" href="#p1170" data-label="1170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1170</a>mother’s four children. He first came to the attention of the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) in 1988 when he was brought to the hospital with a broken arm, the cause of which his parents were unable to explain. On February 8,1989, due to the appellant-mother’s admission of neglect, DCYF took over the legal supervision of Joseph. In September 1992, DCYF assumed the total care, custody and control of Joseph.</p>
    <p id="b1224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1224.4",1224,[204,752,758,1165]]]'>Through services obtained with the help of DCYF, Joseph has been diagnosed with and treated for several psychological and behavioral problems including hyperactivity, aggression, impulsiveness, insomnia, self-abuse, sexualized behavior and depression. The mother has throughout her involvement with DCYF expressed difficulty in controlling Joseph and in controlling her other children when Joseph is present. The mother has, herself, been diagnosed with and received treatment for several psychological disorders including obsessive/compulsive disorder, manic depression, and agoraphobia. Additionally, the live-in boyfriend Joseph’s mother was seeing intermittently during DCYF’s involvement with Joseph suffered from domestic abuse problems as well as drug and alcohol dependency, including the use of “crack” cocaine. As a result of that unstable home life, between 1990 and 1992 Joseph was constantly being moved around among his mother’s home, his foster home with his paternal aunt and uncle and his in-patient treatment at Bradley Hospital.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On July 20, 1994, DCYF filed an involuntary termination of parental rights petition with regard to Joseph. Joseph’s mother later changed her mind regarding the permanent placement of Joseph, but by that point in time, DCYF had already begun the process of terminating the mother’s parental rights. By November 1994, the mother had not visited with Joseph for at least a year. On April 10, 1995, the mother’s visitation rights were suspended by the Family Court because she repeatedly missed scheduled visits with Joseph.</p>
    <p id="b1224-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1224.10",1224,[1005,720,750,1044]]]'>After the hearing on DCYF’s petition to terminate the parental rights of Joseph’s mother, the Family Court justice determined that despite the copious services and assistance provided by DCYF, the mother had not been able to adequately care for Joseph and had, instead, sent him away from the home whenever she was confronted with any type of a crisis. The trial justice concluded, therefore, that although the mother seemed to be able to care for her other three children, she was unfit to parent Joseph. She further found that Joseph had been in the care of DCYF for at least six months,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that the conditions in the mother’s home were unlikely to change, and that there was not a substantial probability that Joseph, considering his age and need for a permanent home, would be able to return to his mother’s home. Accordingly, she granted the petition to terminate. The trial justice’s findings are supported by the record.</p>
