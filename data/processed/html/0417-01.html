As Vance was issuing a citation for the infraction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> appellant “became agitated” and “begun cussing” at the officer, yelling that “you think I am like the rest of these niggas down here” and “you don’t know who you are fucking with, I’m with the FBI” (an assertion not borne out by evidence). Appellant, who had a female companion with him, also accused Vance of “profiling.” Despite Vance’s warning to stop yelling, appellant continued cursing and screaming words to the same effect. According to Vance, “five to seven” Metro patrons “started watching [to] see[ ] what the commotion was all about.” A female police officer with Vance told appellant’s companion “to step aside” or “pushed her aside a couple of yards.” When appellant refused to sign the citation, Vance arrested him.</p>

Officer Vance testified that as appellant cursed at him and accused him, in effect, of racial harassment, a small group of Metro patrons gathered to see what the “commotion” was about, and “looked a little annoyed.” Even assuming that these onlookers understood the tenor of appellant’s exclamations, nothing in the evidence suggests that their “annoy[ance]” was directed toward the officers rather than appellant, as he cursed at and accused an officer who, at the time, was engaged only in issuing him a citation. Nor did any evidence suggest that appellant was attempting to incite the onlookers by, for example, addressing his angry words to them. That feature distinguishes this case from others in which we have sustained disorderly conduct convictions. <em>See, e.g., W.H.L., </em><a href="/a2d/743/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="743 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="11495463" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/1226-01">743 A.2d at 1229</a> (pointing out that in both <em>Rodgers </em>and <em>Chemalali, <a href="/a2d/655/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="655 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="7880202" data-case-paths="/a2d/655/1226-01">supra,</a> </em>“the defendants addressed a crowd that had gathered, apparently in an attempt to invoke some reaction against the police”). By contrast, in <em>W.H.L. </em>we reversed the conviction for insufficient evidence where a crowd had gathered after a policeman grabbed the juvenile-defendant’s bicycle and the latter began yelling and cursing at the officer, but where no evidence implied that the defendant “was ... attempting to entice the crowd to act against the police” or that “the reaction of the crowd” bespoke hostility towards the police. <a href="/a2d/655/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="655 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="7880202" data-case-paths="/a2d/655/1226-01">Id.</a></p>

      <em>W.H.L. </em>cannot meaningfully be distinguished from this case, where the proof showed neither an attempt to incite others nor a reaction on the part of bystanders beyond “looking] a little annoyed by what was going on.” The fact that, as Officer Vance testified, he nonetheless feared a hostile reaction in a neighborhood he did not consider police-friendly cannot substitute for this deficiency in actual proof of words likely, in the circumstances, to pro<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>voke a violent reaction by others. The fact, too, that an officer pushed appellant’s female companion to the side during the encounter is too thin a reed to support an inference that she, or anyone else present, threatened a breach of the peace.</p>
