Appellant contends that since Dr. Koller tested out in 1985, the tube used by Bainbridge in 1928 and got the same results as Bainbridge, then Bainbridge’s Summer Report must be accepted as evidence of successful reduction to practice. It is conceded that this argument is a plausible one and it is very improbable that Bainbridge could have plotted the curve shown in the Summer Report unless it was based on actual tests and the tests, Exhibit N, conducted by Doctor Koller at the time of taking testimony, tend to strengthen this assumption.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b738-7" data-blocks='[["BL_738.7",738,[217,1527,1326,576]]]'>However, it has been the long established practice of this Office to require that an inventor’s testimony as to successful reduction to practice be positively corroborated before it will be accepted as such.

Appellant argues that it is extremely unlikely that Bainbridge could' have theoretically conceived of the co-ordinates from which he plotted his curve given in his Summer Report and that he must necessarily have actually made the tests, and that this Summer Report should therefore be accepted as full corroboration of his tests. At best, appellant is asking us to accept circumstantial evidence in lieu of the direct positive testimony called for by the long established practice. We do not believe that we would be warranted in doing so. The matter of actual reduction to practice is of such vital importance that we cannot afford to accept conjectures or possibilities, however plausible, in lieu of the direct positive proofs previously required.</blockquote>
