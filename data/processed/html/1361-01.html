Hagans had failed a flight training course that would have qualified him to fly the plane; consequently, he was in violation of the plane’s insurance policy. The plane crashed, and Hagans was killed. When the insurance company refused to compensate them for the loss of the plane, Eastern and G &amp; J submitted claims against Hagans’ estate within six months after the appointment of personal representatives, as required by D.C.Code § 20-903(a) (1981). The estate sent notices to both Eastern and G &amp; J disallowing the claims on December 14, 1984, thereby triggering a requirement under D.C.Code § 20-908(a) (1981) that suit on the claim be filed within sixty days, <em>i.e., </em>by February 12, 1985.</p>

    <p id="b1409-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1409.11",1409,[960,820,753,850]]]'>Appellants’ equal protection argument is that section 20-908 (a) discriminates against them in two ways. First, their claims were not covered by liability insurance; if they were, the short time limit of section 20-908 would not apply to them (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>Second, their claims were not against a living person; if they were, section 20-908 would not apply to them. We must decide, therefore, whether the restrictions on claims against decedents’ estates which the statute imposes are rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>E.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Diving Center, Inc., </em><a href="/us/473/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="473 U.S. 432" data-case-ids="6200639" data-case-paths="/us/473/0432-01">473 U.S. 432</a>, 439-442, <a href="/us/473/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="473 U.S. 432" data-case-ids="6200639" data-case-paths="/us/473/0432-01">105 S.Ct. 3249</a>, 3254-3255, <a href="/us/473/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="473 U.S. 432" data-case-ids="6200639" data-case-paths="/us/473/0432-01">87 L.Ed.2d 313</a> (1985).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We conclude that they are.</p>

Green, </em><a href="/a2d/528/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="528 A.2d 429" data-case-ids="7896119" data-case-paths="/a2d/528/0429-01">528 A.2d 429</a>, 434 (D.C.1987). It cannot be seriously questioned that this is a legitimate governmental interest. This purpose is fulfilled by both of the legislative classifications of which appellants complain. As to the first, differentiating between claims covered by insurance and claims not covered by insurance is rationally related to the purpose of protecting claimants whose claims, though nominally <a id="p1364" href="#p1364" data-label="1364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1364</a>against dead persons, do not interfere with the prompt settlement of estates. If a claim is to be paid by an insurance carrier, rather than by an estate, then the quick settlement of the estate is not hindered. With regard to appellants’ second contention, we are satisfied that different treatment for claims against living persons and claims against the estates of dead persons is rationally related to the same legitimate governmental interest, namely, protecting the interests of heirs by having estates settled promptly. We see no equal protection issue here.</p>
    <p id="b1410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1410.4",1410,[212,912,756,978]]]'>The essence of appellants’ due process claim is that they were kept out of court by the sixty-day time limit that started running when the notices of disallowance of their claims were mailed, even though responsible officials did not know that their respective companies had received these notices. Eastern was liquidated soon before, and its deputy receiver was appointed soon after, the time to file suit had expired. The deputy receiver did not know about the notice of disallowance until it was raised in a motion to dismiss in the suit in Pennsylvania. G &amp; J alleges that all of its principals were gone long before the filing deadline, and that its bankruptcy trustee was not appointed until well after the time to file suit had expired. The trustee, like his counterpart at Eastern, also did not know about the disallowance of the claim until the point came up in federal court.</p>

There is no allegation that the estate knew a receiver and a trustee were soon to be appointed for Eastern and G &amp; J, respectively.

However, Eastern could have filed suit at any time between December 14, 1984, and January 28, 1985; it was not until its liquidation on the latter date that it became legally incapable of filing. Reference to the law of receivers, moreover, convinces us that Eastern’s situation does not call for relief.

Since section 20-908 is stricter than any statute of limitations and has the same effect, <em>i.e., </em>to bar a claim, we can say with assurance that the appointment of a receiver does not provide relief from the application of section 20-908. <em>Cf. Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, </em>— U.S. —, <a href="/us/485/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="108 S.

In addition, even if we were to assume that the sixty days did not begin to run until a receiver or trustee was appointed, both Eastern's receiver and G &amp; J s trustee failed to file suit within sixty days after their respective appointments. Indeed, more than a year passed from the date of their appointments before they filed suit at all, and when they did, it was in the wrong court.</p>

Appellants halfway admit that they should have acted on the claims earlier, even though they were not actually aware of the notices of disallowance. Both the receiver and the trustee, in their affidavits, stated that their claims against the Hagans estate were not pursued sooner because they were busy trying to reorder the disarrayed affairs of their respective companies; Eastern’s receiver described what he was doing as “putting out the fires.” In the teeth of section 20-908, these excuses do not justify equitable relief.</p>

Appellants maintain that equity favors permitting them to sue the estate now, arguing that the statutory goal of prompt settlement of estates would not be defeated, since the estate is still open, involved in other litigation. Without conceding that such an argument, if correct, might convince us to ignore the clear language of section 20-908, we note that the argument is not correct. The other litigation in which the estate is involved, which was no doubt timely begun, may well be over soon. If appellants were permitted to commence their litigation now, it might last for quite some time, long enough to keep the estate open far beyond what would otherwise be its closing date. For this reason also, we conclude that allowing appellants to sue now would thwart the statutory purpose of facilitating the prompt settlement of estates.</p>
