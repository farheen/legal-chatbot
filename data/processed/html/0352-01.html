The City of Washington (City) appealed the board’s determinations and, after an evidentiary hearing, the board reaffirmed its earlier findings that the properties were tax exempt. The City appealed the board’s determinations to the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b413-7" data-blocks='[["BL_413.7",413,[208,1166,751,371]]]'>An evidentiary hearing was held before the trial court on April 5, 1994. On August 5, 1994, the trial court issued an order sustaining the City’s appeal and ordering that the board’s decisions be reversed thereby subjecting the 87 properties to real estate taxation. The trial court’s order was based upon the following facts.</p>
    <p id="b413-8" data-blocks='[["BL_413.8",413,[211,1594,203,30]]]'>II. FACTS</p>
    <p id="b413-9" data-blocks='[["BL_413.9",413,[209,1657,751,561]]]'>W &amp; J was founded as an academy of education in the eighteenth century by the Ministers of the Presbyterian Church. It is incorporated as a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation and it has a charitable exemption pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. In the last two centuries W &amp; J has developed into a nonsectarian, private, coeducational, four-year college. About 1,100 full time students attend. The students come from various parts of the United States and from a few foreign countries.</p>
    <p id="b413-10" data-blocks='[["BL_413.10",413,[208,2243,749,368]],["BL_413.11",413,[1009,217,745,86]]]'>Students are admitted to the college on academic qualifications, and the nondiscriminatory policy allows enrollment irrespective of sex, race, color, creed, or national origin. Of interest in the context of enrollment, is the fact that the college has a program for the academically underprivileged students, those who generally have a G.P.A. of 2.1 or less. Generally 10% of the first-year class enters this program.</p>
    <p id="b413-15" data-blocks='[["BL_413.14",413,[1007,330,749,890]]]'>About 79% of the students receive financial aid through grants, loans, or academic awards, and often a combination of such aids. No criterion based on financial need is established as a condition; that is, if the student seeking admission reports that he or she will need financial assistance, then the paper work for that purpose is completed. When clearance (sources of financial aid) is required but not obtained or if other financial arrangements are not completed, the student will not be enrolled. During the time the student spends in college, if he or she cannot pay the tuition and expenses or cannot obtain financing, the student cannot complete the education. In the past year, seven or eight students were not permitted to return to classes because of the inability to pay or to secure aid.</p>
    <p id="b413-16" data-blocks='[["BL_413.15",413,[1006,1254,750,609]]]'>The cost of education at the college, like other institutions of higher learning, continues to rise. The annual charge for regular, day-time education (including tuition, room, board, and miscellaneous fees) is $19,360. About five students a year receive from the college full tuition, room, and board on the basis of merit. No scholarships are given based on need. People from the community or students who attend evening classes must pay for their own tuition and books. No one may attend evening classes unless the person can pay.</p>
    <p id="b413-17" data-blocks='[["BL_413.16",413,[1005,1889,749,555]]]'>W &amp; J is a member of the Commission for Independent Colleges and Universities, an organization that promotes the goals of private institutions of higher learning in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The college pays a fee to the organization. Of the ninety-three (93) private institutions in the Commonwealth, these institutions educate about thirty-nine (39) percent of the enrolled students. Of the state appropriations for student aid, about 95% of that aid goes to public institutions.</p>

Some of the trustees <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>do not ask for reimbursement. The Board of Trustees appoints the president of the college, and in turn, the vice presidents are appointed. The salaries and other emoluments of their offices do not appear excessive and do not indicate any payment of dividends or profits indirectly. The president and dean of academic affairs are provided residences free of charge in addition to their salaries. W &amp; J’s total payroll exceeds $8 million a year.</p>
    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[222,756,751,839]]]'>W &amp; J’s endowment is controlled by the finance committee. Investments are made in common stocks. When the president of the college, Dr. Howard J. Burnett, assumed office in 1970, the college had a short-term debt of about $1 million and a long term debt of $10 million. At that time, the endowment was $6.6 million. To survive the financial crisis of those days, Dr. Burnett, the officers, trustees, and many other persons and entities contributed much in time and money so that the college of today is in sound financial condition. In 1980, the market value of the endowment was $11.2 million. By 1990, the market value of the endowment had increased to $44.4 million. At the present time, the market value of the endowment is about $50 million.</p>

W &amp; J anticipates an operating loss of slightly more than $1 million. The vice president for business and finance, Duane Lantz, testified that this pessimistic outlook is caused by several factors: (1) money from capital campaigns was less than anticipated; (2) slightly lower student enrollment; and (3) lower yield from endowments.</p>

In the seminal case of <em>Don-ohugh’s Appeal, </em>our Supreme Court determined that The Library Company of Philadelphia was entitled to an exemption from taxation as a purely public charity and in so doing discussed the essential feature of a public use:</p>

The smallest street in the smallest village is a public highway of the Commonwealth, and none the less so because a vast majority of the citizens will certainly never derive any benefit from its use. It is enough that they may do so if they choose. So there is no charity conceivable which will not, in its practical operation, exclude a large part of mankind, and there are few which do not do so in express terms, or by the restrictive force of the description of the persons for whose benefit they are intended. Thus, Girard College excludes, by a single word, half the public, by requiring that only <em>male </em>children shall be received; the great Pennsylvania Hospital closes its gates to all but <em>recent </em>injuries, yet no one questions that they are public charities in the widest and most exacting sense.</blockquote>

Some system of government, some regulations of administration, are necessary in all large bodies; provided they be reasonable and not repugnant to the general purpose, they are valid and do not affect the character of the institution ... The law prohibits a common carrier from discriminating between persons; it requires him to carry all men the same journey for the same price; yet there is probably no railroad in the country that does not issue season or mileage tickets, or commutation in some form or other, to its local customers, and this has never been held to impair or infringe upon its public character as a common carrier.

In <em>St. Margaret Seneca, </em>our Supreme Court applied the <em>HUP </em>criteria and held that a nursing home qualified as a purely public charity exempt from property tax.

Opinion of the trial court (Trial court opinion), August 5, 1994, at 12. The trial court recognized that providing education is not of itself a charitable function and that higher education is a privilege, not a public responsibility. <em>Id. </em>at 13,15.
