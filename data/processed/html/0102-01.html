The underlying medical malpractice action was instituted by appellees, Jane Russell, admin-istratrix of the estate of Joshua Russell, and Jane Russell in her own right, against appellants, Albert Einstein Medical Center, Northern Division (“AEMC”), Soleiman Soli, M.D., and Jeffrey Levine, M.D.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On October 5, 1986, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Jane Russell presented herself at AEMC in the early stages of labor. Ms. Russell was placed under the care of Dr. Levine, who, at the time, was a chief resident in obstetrics and gynecology at AEMC. Ms. Russell was taken to the labor room, and at 9:30 a.m. her amniotic membranes were ruptured as a means to accelerate labor and to facilitate placement of a fetal scalp monitor to measure fetal heart rate. At approximately 4:00 p.m., it was noted that Ms. Russell had a fever, as a result of suspected choriamnionitis, an infection of the membranes surrounding the fetus. To combat the suspected infection, a broad spectrum antibiotic was administered. Subsequently, Ms. Russell was moved to the delivery room, and at approximately 4:50 p.m. Dr. Levine attempted to effect a vaginal delivery by means of vacuum extraction and forceps. Sometime after 4:00 p.m., Dr. Soli, the attending physician on call, was telephoned at his home and apprised of the situation. Exactly when Dr. Soli was contacted and when he arrived at the hospital <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>were disputed issues at trial. Dr. Soli and Dr. Levine consulted and decided to allow Ms. Russell’s labor to proceed for a short time longer. Dr. Soli examined Ms. Russell at approximately 6:35 p.m., and then decided to perform a caesarean section in order to deliver the baby. The operation commenced at 7:16 p.m., and Joshua Russell was delivered at 7:33 p.m. Joshua Russell died at 4:04 p.m. on October 6, 1986, due to a streptococcal infection.</p>

Diaz and a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Plaintiffs’ case was based on the theory Joshua Russell died of a streptococcal infection due to defendants’ failure to perform a timely caesarean section. On December 9,1992, the jury returned a verdict against both defendants, apportioning negligence in the amount of 75 per cent to Dr. Levine and 25 per cent to Dr. Soli. The jury awarded damages in the amount of $605,000 for Joshua Russell’s future lost earnings and $100,000 for pain and suffering.</p>

At trial, appellee read into evidence, over objections by Dr. Soli, excerpts from the deposition of nurse Kimberly Arrowsmith, wherein she stated that Dr. Soli first entered Ms. Russell’s room at 6:35 on October 5, 1986. Nurse Arrowsmith’s statement directly contradicted Dr. Soli’s own testimony that he had gone to see Ms. Russell as soon as he arrived at the hospital, approximately one-half hour earlier than the time noted by Nurse Arrowsmith.</p>

The policy reasons which justify wanting to minimize the time physicians spend in a courtroom apply equally to nurses, as well as other medical personnel. The defendants’ assertion to the contrary is without merit and lacks any foundation in logic. Clearly, had the legislature intended to limit Pa.R.Civ.P. 4020(a)(5) to apply only to physicians, the more broad term “medical witness” would not have been used.</blockquote>

In the present case, for example, the Rule was invoked to allow for Nurse Arrowsmith’s testimony regarding when Dr. Soli arrived to examine Ms. Russell, testimony not “medical” in nature. Under the trial court’s interpretation of the Rule, any hospital support personnel with this knowledge would be viewed as “medical witnesses” and could have provided the same testimony, whether they were nurses, social workers or even custodial staff in the area.

In <em>Reichman, </em>plaintiffs medical malpractice action was based upon the alleged failure of physicians to treat promptly internal bleeding which followed the performance of a hysterectomy. In support of her claim, plaintiff was permitted to introduce a hearsay statement by a non-party witness in the operating room to the effect that defendant/physician ignored at least five telephone calls to his office requesting medical assistance for plaintiff. In awarding a new trial, the <em>Reichman </em>Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b171-14" data-blocks='[["BL_171.14",171,[990,2313,720,419]],["BL_172.1",172,[227,224,719,1533]]]'>A majority of the court en banc which heard the post verdict motions concluded that the admission of the hearsay statement had been error but that the error was harmless. We are unable to agree with the assessment of harmlessness. Mrs. Reichman’s evidence of negligence by Dr. Wallach was far from overwhelming. Indeed, the evidence of causation between <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>the operative and post operative care which she received from Dr. Wallach and the subsequent finding of a seemingly unrelated disease was relatively weak. The improper hearsay statement attributed to Dr. Troncelliti injected into the case an unsupported opinion that Mrs. Reichman was in critical condition following performance of a hysterectomy. Moreover, it implied, without evidence, that Dr. Wallach had willfully ignored the needs of a critically ill patient. There are not many aspects of medical misfeasance that will more quickly influence, perhaps prejudice, lay jurors than for a physician to ignore a patient. To be told that a physician has abandoned a critically ill patient and left her to her chances will persuade the most hardened juror against such an uncaring physician. Here, the only evidence that Dr. Wallach was uncaring and had ignored calls for help came into evidence by an improperly admitted hearsay statement. Thus it was not merely cumulative. Mrs. Reichman’s evidence, as we have observed, was not overwhelming. <em>The introduction of this inadmissible and highly prejudicial hearsay statement under these circumstances was far from harmless. </em>In view of the close and vigorously contested nature of the liability issues, the balance may well have been tipped in favor of Mrs. Reich-man by this improper evidence.</blockquote>
