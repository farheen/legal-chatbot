(Warfield) and Eicon Enterprises, Inc. (Eicon) — which had been responsible for servicing the elevator during different time periods before the accident occurred. The trial court granted summary judgment for Warfield, denied a motion to vacate that judgment, and, without stating reasons, certified both orders as a “final judgment” pursuant to Super.Ct.Civ.R. 54(b) — despite the fact that plaintiffs action was still pending against Eicon and that Ei-con’s cross-claim was pending against War-<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>field. In appealing from the orders granting summary judgment and denying her motion to vacate, plaintiff-appellant, Lillie Anne Peoples, contends that the trial court (1) erred in granting summary judgment because the court failed to consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to her, and (2) abused its discretion in denying her motion to vacate under Super.Ct.Civ.R. 60(b)(2) because it refused to recognize newly discovered evidence. We raise, <em>sua sponte, </em>the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in entering final judgment under Rule 54(b) in light of the pending claim and cross-claim.</p>

Three days later, on August 31, Warfield filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the time for discovery had expired without appellant’s alleging any breach of duty by Warfield or proffering any evidence of Warfield’s negligence. On September 4, appellant received Warfield’s responses to her June discovery requests. On September 11, Warfield filed a motion opposing appellant’s August 28 request for extending the discovery deadline. On October 7, Judge Eilperin denied appellant’s motion to extend and granted Warfield’s motion for summary judgment.

On June 2, Judge Cushenberry summarily denied the motion.

If we were to agree, this presumably would mean that appellant’s claim had renewed vitality against two defendants, not just one (Eicon). Implicit in this argument for permitting, in effect, an interlocutory appeal is appellant’s hope, if not expectation, that this court would reverse and remand the case against Warfield to a trial judge who had been waiting for our decision before commencing or resuming trial. In that case, the trial could go forward against both defendants, Warfield and Eicon, to sort out which of them (if either) was responsible for negligent maintenance of the elevator. The presumed virtue in this approach would be the avoidance of an expensive retrial of the entire case if a post-trial appeal were to show that Warfield had been removed, erroneously, as one of the defendants. <em>See Cullen v.

In the first place, appellant was in no hurry to achieve a pretrial appellate reversal; she waited a year after denial of her motion to vacate before obtaining Rule 54(b) certification. Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate that the proceedings against Eicon (and between Eicon and Warfield) have been suspended; a second trial may be necessary anyway if appellant were to prevail here on appeal. Nor, in any event, is there an established policy favoring the deferral or suspension of trials involving multiple defendants to permit an interlocutory appeal of a dismissal or summary judgment for one of the parties before the trial proceeds to final judgment on all claims presented. <em>See Hogan v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em><a href="/f2d/961/1021-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="961 F.2d 1021" data-case-ids="1863151" data-case-paths="/f2d/961/1021-01">961 F.2d 1021</a>, 1026 (2d Cir.1992). To the contrary, for most cases the operating assumption must be that if an appeal goes forward under Rule 54(b) as to one defendant, the trial will go forward as to the other defendants, creating the possibility, indeed likelihood, of two appeals arising out of the same litigation. The likelihood of a second trial, however, is the same whether the appeals are resolved separately or as one, since the issues raised by all who lose in the trial court must be resolved sooner or later, and any second trial presumably will await the combined results. Ordinarily, therefore, because Rule 54(b) is not a device for preventing a second trial, we have to focus on the impact a pretrial or mid-trial appeal will have on the appellate process while the underlying litigation itself proceeds unabated.</p>

The trial court has not supplied a statement of reasons for Rule 54(b) certification that completes its task of weighing and balancing the contending factors. <em>Curtiss-Wright, </em><a href="/us/446/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="446 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6179993" data-case-paths="/us/446/0001-01">446 U.S. at 10</a>, <a href="/us/446/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="446 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6179993" data-case-paths="/us/446/0001-01">100 S.Ct. at 1466</a>.

When trial court certification portends piecemeal appeals, a clear statement of reasons for certification is essential for review. Accordingly, joining most of the federal circuit courts of appeals, we hold that a Rule 54(b) certification must be accompanied by a statement of reasons explaining why the judgment should be deemed final for purposes of appeal. <em>See Anthuis v.

After all, as Eicon’s cross-claim itself indicates, this is fundamentally a case where plaintiff is saying that one of two defendants (or possibly both) are liable for negligence, and that discovery and trial presumably will make clear who the principal culprit is, based on the direction critical evidence is found to point. This situation appears inherently to suggest a close connection, not severability, between the factual and legal issues.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[202,803,763,1941]]]'>On the other hand, suppose this court could be convinced that summary judgment had been properly entered against Warfield for lack of proffered evidence revealing negligence, and that there is little basis for believing appellant’s discovery after summary judgment could have been properly used as “newly discovered evidence” to reopen the judgment under Rule 60(b)(2). Such determinations would indicate that there were no factual or legal issues that could generate overlapping appeals since the first ruling would have been based on a negligible, finite record and the second ruling would have proceeded from a legal analysis unaffected by the trial against Eicon. Even in that situation, however, at least as far as we can tell now, there would be no discernible reason to hear the appeal at this time. As we noted earlier, appellant might be satisfied by a judgment against, or settlement with, Ei-con and, even if not, could pursue all appeals together as one, saving this court’s time overall even if the issues as to each party would be different. Absent a reasoned trial court justification, therefore, we cannot perceive prejudice either to appellant or to War-field from our declining to hear this appeal on the merits. Because appellant’s complaint against Eicon, as well as Eicon’s cross-claim against Warfield, are still pending, plaintiff still has an opportunity to prevail at trial, without need for this appeal, and, appellant in any event, will not lose her right eventually to appeal the judgment for Warfield if we decline to hear the appeal now. Similarly, because Warfield is still before the trial court on Eicon’s cross-claim, Warfield has no reason to expedite this appeal instead of defending — or prosecuting — all appeals later at one time.</p>
