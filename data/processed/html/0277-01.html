Officer Diane Groomes of the Metropolitan Police Department testified that on the evening in question, she drove into the area in a scout car. Upon arrival, she observed three men standing on the sidewalk. Officer Groomes testified that she saw one of the men, later identified as appellant Elton R. Jones, drop two ziplock bags to the ground. Two other officers who were in the scout car apparently also observed the drop. Officer Groomes stopped the car, and she and the other officers approached Mr. Jones and directed the other two men to go across the street.</p>

Two other men were with Mr. Jones. Officer Groomes, who knew the two other men “real well,” instructed them to go across the street. Another officer picked up the drugs from the ground in full view of Mr. Jones, who remained standing near where the drugs had fallen. The officers surrounded Mr. Jones, and thus, he was isolated from his companions. The officers arranged for field testing and then continued to stand on the street with the appellant for approximately fifteen minutes.</p>

Mr. Jones’ statement that he was just “holding” the drugs came just after the identification questioning but before the police began express questioning about the drugs: After picking up the drugs, the officers asked for the suspect’s ID or his name and address. At that point, Mr. Jones “spontaneously]” “volunteered” that he was merely “holding” for the other guys. Only after that point did the officers ask whether Mr. Jones wanted to “volunteer” further information about the drugs. Although the government concedes that the latter questioning was interrogation, the argument is that the later-asked questions cannot taint the statement that Mr. Jones made, whether it is considered as a spontaneous remark or as, at most, a non sequitur response to “what is your name?” For the reasons explained below, I take little comfort in the “timing” analysis.</p>

Nor is this even a case in which the suspect’s name or address would likely have given away some incriminating detail. Thus, it seems more appropriate to analyze this case under the rubric of “spontaneous” or “volunteered” statements. If it were indeed clear that Mr. Jones’ statement was not improperly compelled by psychological pressures, it would undoubtedly be admissible. The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>stated that “[vjolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.” <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="86 S.

All other things equal, courts will deem a nonre-sponsive answer to an officer’s question to be “volunteered” and therefore admissible, notwithstanding a lack of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. For example, the statement “But you didn’t catch me driving” is not responsive to an officer’s request that a suspect undergo field sobriety testing, nor is such a request likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>State v.

Mr. Jones was surrounded by several officers. He had just seen one officer pick up the drugs next to his feet, and hold them in his hand. This might be a different case if the officers had asked only for identification and not proceeded to conduct an express interrogation. But they did continue to pose questions while Mr. Jones stood in the street. We may infer from the officers’ further questions that the request for identification signaled the beginning of a conversation to investigate the crime that they had witnessed. Considering the totality of the circumstances, it is difficult to characterize the overall situation as anything other than an inquisitorial session in which Mr. Jones felt compelled to explain himself, and, consequently, made an admission that <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>he would not willingly have made under less coercive circumstances.

To the extent, therefore, that the D.C. Circuit held in <em>Bogle </em>that express questioning designed to serve an administrative purpose at the station house does not trigger <em>Miranda’s </em>protections, our decision in <em>Thomas, supra, </em>albeit precarious, is consistent. To the extent, however, that the <em>Bogle </em>opinion more generally held, as it seems to, that “only questions that are reasonably likely to elicit incriminating information ... constitute interrogation within the protections of <em>Miranda,” </em>it is peculiar that there is very little textual analysis of the fundamental Supreme Court precedent. <em>Bogle, supra, </em><a href="/us-app-dc/325/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="197" data-cite="325 U.S. App. D.C. 63" data-case-ids="3706136" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/325/0063-01">325 U.S.App. D.C. at 67</a>, <a href="/us-app-dc/325/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="114 F.3d 1271" data-case-ids="3706136,405406" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/325/0063-01,/f3d/114/1271-01">114 F.3d at 1275</a>.

Aside from the obvious implications for those in custody, Fifth Amendment jurisprudence substantially affects other facets of constitutional criminal procedure as well. For example, in the recently decided case of <em>Texas v.

Both appeared to view the protections afforded by <em>Miranda </em>as a safety net for situations not implicating the “offense-specific” Sixth Amendment. <em>See Cobb, supra, </em><a href="/us/532/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="532 U.S. 162" data-case-ids="9300919" data-case-paths="/us/532/0162-01">121 S.Ct. at </a>1342 n. 2 (Rehnquist, C.J.) (“Even though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged offenses, defendants retain the ability under <em>Miranda </em>to refuse any police questioning, and, indeed, charged defendants presumably have met with counsel and have had the opportunity to discuss whether it is advisable to invoke those Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, in all but the rarest of cases, the Court’s decision today will have no impact whatsoever upon a defendant’s ability to protect his Sixth Amendment right.”); <em>Cobb, supra, </em><a href="/us/532/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="532 U.S. 162" data-case-ids="9300919" data-case-paths="/us/532/0162-01">121 S.Ct. at 1344</a> (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[I]t is difficult to understand the utility of a Sixth Amendment rule that operates to invalidate a confession given by the free choice of suspects who have received proper advice of their <em>Miranda </em>rights but waived them nonetheless.”). The <em>Cobb </em>decision makes clear that we should be cognizant of the fact that any decision impacting the scope of <em>Miranda </em>also has a domino effect on other fundamental areas of criminal law. <em>Cf.

Given that <em>Miranda’s </em>effectiveness is predicated on its bright-line application <em>and </em>that, accordingly, courts should be loathe to create exceptions to the <em>Miranda </em>doctrine, nothing in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence leads me to conclude that a "routine booking exception” was created in <em>Muniz. </em>In any event, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>it does exist, as a large number of courts believe it does, it should <em>be </em>properly <em>limited </em>— in terms of content, context and scope.</p>
