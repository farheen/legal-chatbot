When Kozura’s employment was terminated following notice and a hearing, the Tulpehocken Education Association (the “Association”), the union representing Kozura, invoked Article XIX of the governing collective bargaining agreement to file a grievance on Kozura’s behalf and to request reinstatement and an award of back pay and corresponding benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Because the Association and the District were unable to resolve the grievance, the matter ultimately was presented to an arbitrator, who conducted hearings and issued an award reinstating Kozura based upon a determination that just cause for discharge did not exist. The arbitrator denied the claim for back pay and benefits, however, concluding that Kozura’s classroom conduct warranted strong discipline in the form of a suspension without pay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Kozura made a request to the Association to file an appeal from the arbitration award, which the Association denied, initially advising Kozura that he could pursue an appeal himself or through counsel, but subsequently notifying Kozura that he had been misinformed regarding his ability to appeal.

The District responded with a motion to quash the appeal, arguing that Kozura lacked standing to challenge the arbitration award, as he was not a party to the arbitration proceedings. Following the submission of stipulated facts and arguments, the common pleas court granted the District’s motion to quash. The common pleas court acknowledged that, as Ko-zura argued, Section 606 of the Public Employee Relations Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> 43 P.S. § 1101.606, afforded individual employees the right to present grievances to their employer and to have such grievances adjusted without their bargaining representative’s intervention, as long as the bargaining representative was allowed to be present at such adjustment, but determined that the statute did not specify whether the employee could also appeal, on his own, an adverse arbitration award. In the present ease, the common pleas court concluded, allowing Kozura to do so would conflict with the relevant collective bargaining agreement, since, in the common pleas court’s interpretation, that agreement vested in the Association the exclusive right to pursue arbitration. Ae-<a id="p1172" href="#p1172" data-label="1172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1172</a>cordingly, the common pleas court explained, the Association and the District were the sole parties to the arbitration proceeding, and Kozura therefore lacked standing to appeal.</p>
