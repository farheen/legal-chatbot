A part of the downwardly traveling energy is reflected upwardly at each subsurface interface. A reflecting interface is a region where there is a change in the velocity [of the seismic energy] us between adjoining layers of the earth, such as a layer of <em>rock (high </em>velocity) and a layer of sand (low velocity). In addition to change in velocity of the seismic energy in the earth due to the velocity characteristics of layers, the velocity through the earth increases with depth.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b676-3" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[224,514,1320,282]]]'>At the earth’s surface, the upwardly reflected energy is detected by a plurality of seismic detectors or geophones. These extend linearly along a line of exploration. After each explosion of dynamite [along the line of exploration], each detector over a period of several seconds generates a plurality of electrical signals representative, inter alia, of reflected energy, multiples, and noise due to random earth <em>movements </em>unrelated to the effect of the reflected seismic energy. [Bracketed insertions ours.]</blockquote>
    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.5",676,[223,820,1322,293]]]'>A seismogram is produced by recording, on a magnetic tape for example, the electrical signals generated by eaclr detector. Ordinarily, a “family” of seismograms is produced for each, dynamite blast — there being one seismogram for each detector. A plurality of dynamite blasts along a line of exploration will therefore yield a plurality of families of seismograms.</p>
    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.6",676,[220,1118,1323,495]]]'>Appellant refers to two ways in which the detectors may be arranged with respect to the shotpoints along the line of exploration, one being referred to as a “split-spread” and the other as an “expanded-spread.” In a split-spread, the shotpoint is located in the center of a spread of detectors. In an expanded-spread the shotpoint is located on the line of exploration but at some distance from the spread of detectors. It is unnecessary for an understanding of this opinion to be aware of further details of these arrangements. It will suffice to note that appellant uses both arrangements simultaneously to produce <em>two </em>families of seismograms for each dynamite blast.</p>
    <p id="b676-6" data-blocks='[["BL_676.7",676,[218,1618,1324,492]]]'>To render meaningful the seismogram produced as described above, it is necessary to apply to it a so-called “weathered-layer correction” and a so-called “normal move-out correction.” With respect to the former, appellant explains that at the earth’s surface there is an unconsolidated, weathered layer (commonly called “soil”) of variable depth and inclination. The velocity of seismic energy passing through this layer is much lower than in the consolidated layer just beneath it. Since the weathered layer is of variable thickness and of low velocity, it is necessary to subtract the travel time of the seismic energy in the weathered layer from the total travel time.</p>
    <p id="b676-7" data-blocks='[["BL_676.8",676,[223,2115,1319,94]],["BL_677.1",677,[118,216,1323,336]]]'>Because of the high velocity contrast which exists between the base of the weathered layer and the adjoining consolidated layer, some <a id="p1355" href="#p1355" data-label="1355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1355</a>of tbe seismic energy produced at the shotpoint will travel downward to the interface of the weathered and consolidated layers and be reflected upward to the detectors. The time-occurrence of the first reflection on the seismogram (time-zero being the instant the dynamite is detonated) provides the time-correction needed to eliminate the effect of the weathered layer on the time or depth measurements of interest.</p>
    <p id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[114,569,1326,851]]]'>A normal move-out correction is necessary to compensate for the geometrical spreading of the detectors. Since the measurements of interest are <em>depths </em>below the earth’s surface, the identification of reflections in terms of <em>vertical </em>travel time is desired. Obviously, the travel path, and therefore travel time, from a shotpoint to a given reflecting interface or “horizon” and then to a given detector is greater for a detector located some distance from the shotpoint than for a detector directly adjacent the shotpoint. In correcting a family of seismograms for normal move-out, however, it must also be taken into account that the effect of geometrical spreading of the detectors decreases with increases in depth from which a given seismic wave is reflected. Therefore, normal move-out corrections must be “dynamic”; that is, the magnitude of each correction for each detector must be varied inversely with the depth from which a wave is reflected — -the greater the depth the less the correction. Stated differently, the longer the time-occurrence of a given wave is from time-zero on a seismogram, the less it is corrected for normal move-out.</p>
    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[109,1427,1327,548]]]'>Correction of a family of seismograms for the weathered-layer and normal move-out yields, in effect, a new family of seismograms on which the positions of the representations of seismic waves relative to one another more nearly correspond to the relative depths of the horizons from which those waves were reflected. Perfect corrections would cause all the reflection signals corresponding to a given horizon to be lined up across the set of seismograms. However, since the corrections are ordinarily somewhat imperfect, further adjustments are made by reproducing the seismograms as traces on an oscilloscope and manipulating knobs on the oscilloscope to bring the reflections into horizontal alignment.</p>

Multiple Mi arises because a wave is reflected from the earth’s surface to horizon BHX and thence again to the surface. Its travel time is twice that for reflection Ex. MX1 and M12 illustrate other types of multiple reflections. There are still others which may obscure the time-appearance of the reflections which are the features of principal interest.</p>

    <p id="b678-8" data-blocks='[["BL_678.9",678,[210,1867,1323,396]]]'>Appellant has also discovered that the reflection-wave front of energy detected by an expanded-spread of detectors is hyperbolic in character. Based on this discovery, appellant has developed a new technique for identifying the multiples which involves applying functions of hyperbolic character to a family of seismograms. In this way, the magnitudes of errors in the normal move-out corrections can be determined and multiples can be separated from reflections, making it possible to remove the multiples from the seismograms.</p>

Were that not so, as it would not be if “Buies” 2 and 3 were the law, a given process including both “physical” and “mental” steps could be statutory during the infancy of the field of technology to which it pertained, when the physical steps were new, and non-statutory at some later time after the physical steps became old, acquiring prior art status, which would be an absurd result.

    <p id="b690-5" data-blocks='[["BL_690.5",690,[231,651,1323,245]]]'>One need only read the last page of the opinion to find the principal holding: “All that is necessary * * * to make a sequence of operational steps a statutory ‘process’ within 3'5 USC 101 is that it be in the technological arts.” No limitations are placed upon this holding. In effect it is a pronouncement of new law.</p>
    <p id="b690-6" data-blocks='[["BL_690.6",690,[227,902,1325,494]]]'>At first reading, it may appear that this holding is but a resurrection of that made in Judge Smith’s opinion in the first <em>Prater </em>decision. Closer analysis reveals that the majority now goes much beyond the holding of our late colleague. A major basis of the holding in that first <em>Prater </em>opinion was that the claimed process must be <em>“disclosed </em>as being a sequence or combination of steps, <em>capable of performance without human </em>intervention.” [Emphasis added.] The opinion was clearly dealing with claims drawn primarily to cover a machine-implemented process but which were found to read also on carrying out the process using mental steps.</p>
    <p id="b690-7" data-blocks='[["BL_690.7",690,[224,1401,1326,293]]]'>Here, however, the majority does not so limit its holding. Musgrave obviously discloses a process which can be implemented entirely by machine. Indeed, he argues with respect to some of his claims that it is unreasonable to interpret them as covering anything but a machine-implemented process. Nevertheless, the majority now says, in effect, that one no longer need disclose apparatus for carrying out his process.</p>
    <p id="b690-8" data-blocks='[["BL_690.8",690,[224,1700,1323,296]]]'>Thus, while not only being a drastic departure from the policy decision implicit in the second <em>Prater </em>case, i.e., to decide the problems in this area of mental processes on a case-by-case basis, the majority opinion also goes far beyond the holding in the first <em>Prater </em>decision. As such, it should be recognized as overruling those cases which were so carefully distinguished by Judge Smith in <em>Prater I.</em>

Any process which is drawn to a technological art is now held to come within the ambit of the Patent Laws. I submit, however, that this court should concern itself only with realities and let the law professors worry about academic prob<a id="p1369" href="#p1369" data-label="1369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1369</a>lems. Tbe realities here are that “mental steps” are no longer a serious problem.</p>
    <p id="b691-3" data-blocks='[["BL_691.4",691,[107,329,1332,597]]]'>Tbe actual ruling in <em>Prater II </em>was that tbe process clabns there involved covered more than tbe appellant conceded tbey were intended to cover and that those claims were therefore unpatentable under 35 USC 112. In dictum, however, the court resolved the biggest problem then facing the patent community, i.e., whether process claims drawn to cover the operation of .a programmed digital computer would be subject to the protection of the patent statutes. With regard to the mental steps problem, the court 'further made it clear that the only proper inquiry should be as follows: Assuming the disclosure of a novel, unobvious machine-implemented process, would a <em>reasonable</em>

      <em> </em>interpretation of the claims include coverage of the process implemented by the human mind?</p>
    <p id="b691-4" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[113,933,1330,585]]]'>More recent cases before this court have made it clear that there is now only a very narrow scope to this “fearful” mental steps doctrine. In <em>In re </em>Bemhart<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and <em>In re </em>Mahony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> we found that the process claims there involved, when interpreted reasonably, did <em>not </em>include within their coverage mental implementation. Additionally, Hule 2 of what the majority calls the “Abrams non-rules” was given a fatal blow in <em>Bemhart </em>where we held that a claimed invention is not non-statutory <em>merely </em>because “the novelty is indicated by an expression which does not itself fit in a statutory class.” Further, in Mahony, the Patent Office view that a claim reading on both statutory and non-statutory subject matter could not comply with the second paragraph of section 112 was discarded.</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[119,1534,1331,645]]]'>What is left ? I submit that in reality very little remains of the “mental steps” doctrine. Before now, the court has not found it necessary to decide whether a claim, drawn to cover a disclosed machine-implemented process but broad enough, even when interpreted reasonably, to cover the same process implemented only with the aid of the human mind, would be statutory. It was also undecided as to what effect the inclusion of a <em>purely </em>mental step, as defined in footnote 22 of <em>Prater II, </em>might have on an otherwise statutory claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Nor did the court decide whether claims drawn to a process consisting entirely of a sequence of <em>purely </em>mental steps would fit within the ambit of 35 USC 101. The majority now proposes to answer all these questions in the affirmative, regardless of the fact that this case could be decided on very narrow grounds.</p>
    <p id="b692-2" data-blocks='[["BL_692.3",692,[233,216,1326,693]]]'>
      <a id="p1370" href="#p1370" data-label="1370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1370</a>I agree witb appellant that claim 60, wlien reasonably interpreted, covers only a machine-implemented process. The decision with regard to that claim and those related to it could have been resolved on that narrow ground. With regard to claim 2 and those other claims which recite a number of “mental” steps along with physical steps, if the court found that they are predicated for patentability on the mental steps (as I believe they are), the board’s decision could be reversed by simply following the <em>Bernlmrt </em>dictum mentioned earlier and approving those enlightened board decisions referred to in the majority opinion which hold, in effect, that if a mental step is not <em>'purely </em>mental, the process including it is within the statutory category of “process” set out in 35 TJS'C 101. This holding would flow naturally from what has been said and held in our earlier opinions, and would be all that is necessary to support reversal of the decision below.</p>

    <p id="b692-5" data-blocks='[["BL_692.6",692,[229,1186,1324,336]]]'>First and foremost will be the problem of interpreting the meaning of “technological arts”. Is this term intended to be synonymous with the “industrial technology” mentioned by Judge Smith ? It sounds broader to me. Necessarily, this will have to be considered a question of law and decided on a case-by-case basis. Promulgation of any all-encompassing definition has to be impossible. This task is now before us.</p>
    <p id="b692-6" data-blocks='[["BL_692.7",692,[225,1535,1325,494]]]'>Already alluded to is the apparent decision not to require that a machine-implemented process be disclosed. This might have some salutary effect in certain circumstances, where machine implementation would be obvious from disclosure of the process steps alone. But what happens where it is not so obvious? Then we could get involved in deciding, first, whether a reasonable interpretation of the claims would include both machine and mental implementation of the process and, second, whether the absence of a disclosure of apparatus for carrying out the process would warrant rejection of the broad process claims for lack of support.</p>
    <p id="b692-7" data-blocks='[["BL_692.8",692,[223,2036,1322,345]]]'>Justifying the decision finding claims drawn entirely to <em>purely </em>mental processes to be statutory, the majority states that “[a] step requiring the exercise of subjective judgment without restriction might be objectionable as rendering a claim indefinite.” It should not require much imagination to see the many problems sure to be involved in trying to decide whether a step requiring certain human judgment evaluations is definite or not.</p>

This is not too far fetched. Would such a claim ibe statutory? Would it comply with section 112? We will have to face these problems some day.</p>
    <p id="b693-4" data-blocks='[["BL_693.4",693,[102,462,1322,246]]]'>In conclusion, I think it is apparent that what the majority has done will only substitute for one set of problems another possibly more complex set. Because the problems will be new, they will add confusion to the law. We are only now beginning to make some sense out of this area of the law. To change at this time, I submit, is non-sense.</p>
