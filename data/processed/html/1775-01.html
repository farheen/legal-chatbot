The same materials are recited in both present claim 24 and the patent claim, and while the word “comprising” indicates that the composition <em>may </em>have other ingredients therein, the same materials are spelled out in both claims, The use of the word “comprising” instead of “consisting of” and the variation in the ranges and sizes of the materials used, as recited in these claims, merely constitute differences in scope between the claim of this application and the claim 1 of the patent and hence the patent and the application are claiming the same invention. Since the patent and the application are claiming the same invention, although the claims differ in scope, we agree with the Examiner that Rule 131, Rules of Practice, is not the proper remedy to overcome the Samfield et al. patents, and the Samfield et al. patents are proper references for everything disclosed therein, since these patents were the winning parties in the above noted interferences with appellant.

See page 138, column 1 of 121 USPQ * * <em>*. </em>The counts being considered by the court defined a composition “consisting of” certain materials, but since all of the runs except the ferrotype run included other materials which, according to the testimony, materially affected the locust bean gum, an element of the claimed composition, the court held that those other runs were not within the counts which were limited to the specific materials named. It is therefore apparent that appellant had proof available to support claims such as those now on appeal which are not limited to the specific materials of the counts of the previous interferences, since the claims on appeal recite a composition, or method of making a composition “comprising” the named materials and hence not specifically limited to those materials.

    <p id="b1106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1106.5",1106,[287,1145,1327,793]]]'>Determination of the merits of that rejection requires consideration of the differences between claims 24,25, 30, and 32 through 36, involved herein, and the interference counts, particularly those of No. 87,744, the interference with the original Samfield et al. patent. Count 1 of that interference set out hereinabove, calls for a composition “consisting” of a plant gum consisting essentially of galactomannan, moisture, and “the balance essentially all” dry-ground tobacco. Count 2 defines the composition as “consisting” of locust bean gum, moisture and “the balance essentially all” dry-ground tobacco. The District Court held that, because of the expressions using “consisting” and “essentially” as quoted, were not open to the inclusion of other additives which materially affect the characteristics of the composition. The court found that glyoxal and glassine paper fiber, included in certain runs relied on by appellant for reduction to practice prior to the Samfield et al. filing date did affect the characteristics of the product so as to exclude those runs from the counts.</p>

Claim 25 calls for a composition according to claim 24 in which the plant gum comprises locust bean gum, a particular gum named in the Samfield et al. patents as well as in the present application. Appellant, as well as the examiner and board, have treated those claims as generic, dominating the interference counts awarded to Samfield et al. as well as other appealed claims which include additional ingredients that the District Court found to affect the characteristics of the composition.</p>

      <a id="p1783" href="#p1783" data-label="1783" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1783</a>The situation here is closely analogous to that in the <em>Derleth </em>case. As in Derleth, appellant here was informed in the letter declaring Interference No. 87,744 that certain claims in his application, including an article claim which is clearly <em>broader </em>than the counts in the use of the term “comprising” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> would be held subject to rejection as unpatentable over the issue in the event of an award of priority adverse to him. Also appellant t ook no action during the pendency of the interference to make known any disagreement with that holding. In particular, appellant did not take action under the procedure of M.P.E.P., Section 1101.02B, to place a claim to broader subject matter in issue by demonstrating that his best evidence lies outside the terms of the Samfield et al. patent claims constituting the counts.</p>
    <p id="b1107-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1107.4",1107,[220,890,1324,851]]]'>Appellant urges that procedure was not available because the difference between the broader claims he now seeks and the interference issue is not merely a difference in scope but was held by the District Court to be a patentable distinction. That latter contention is clearly erroneous. The District Court merely ruled that compositions of appellant which included an additive excluded from the interference counts through their use of “consisting” and “essentially” did not fall within the terms of those counts. The court made no ruling that a patentable difference is involved. The composition claims here defined a composition or mixture made up of a plurality of component materials.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
                   Neither they nor the counts of the interference define the subject matter as involving a chemical reaction between the component materials. Thus the difference that results from the use of the term “comprising” in the appealed composition claims and the terms “consisting” and “essentially” in the counts is merely a matter of scope in a mechanical mixture and not a matter of chemical genus and species relationship.</p>

The element most conspicuously absent is detrimental reliance on the part of the party to whom the representation was made or toward whom the conduct was directed. The opposing “party” in <em>this </em>case is, of course, the Patent Office, and it is difficult to see how that agency has been induced by any representations or conduct of appellant to assume a detrimental position in reliance thereon. Indeed, it is doubtful that any of the acts of appellant could be said to have been a “representation,” although it is <em>arguable </em>that his failure to move to have the broader claims made an issue of the interference could be considered as evidence of an intent to abandon his hope of securing patent protection for them.

But this begins to sound like an estoppel in the res judicata sense, wherein the parties are precluded from relitigating matters that <em>were </em>or <em>could have </em>been decided in an earlier contest between them. And indeed, the case from which much of the so-called doctrine of <em>estoppel in pais </em>seems to spring, <em>Blackford </em>v. Wilder, <a href="/app-dc/28/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="28 App. D.C. 535" data-case-ids="8746882" data-case-paths="/app-dc/28/0535-01">28 App. D.C. 535</a> (1907), rests its decision squarely on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>As the court there stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1112.5",1112,[294,1617,1328,371]]]'>To sum up: The parties are the same. The applications are the same, and disclose the invention of each issue.

The decisions of this court seem to have subtly shifted from the true rule of res judi-cata annunciated in <em>Blackford </em>v.

However, in an even earlier case, <em>In re </em>Austin, <a href="/ccpa/17-2/1202-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="17 C.C.P.A. 1202" data-case-ids="12116834" data-case-paths="/ccpa/17-2/1202-01">17 CCPA 1202</a>, <a href="/f2d/40/0756-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="40 F.2d 756" data-case-ids="1792741" data-case-paths="/f2d/40/0756-01">40 F. 2d 756</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20285" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="5 U.S.P.Q.

What, then, do these cases really hold? As far as I have been able to determine, they annunciate a sound judicial policy: Where claims <em>clearly </em>could have been put in issue in a previously adjudicated interference proceeding, an applicant should not normally be allowed such claims in a subsequent ex parte proceeding. The reported decisions can be rationalized on no other basis. There is no estoppel in pais, <em>no </em>res judicata. There is simply the judicial determination that it is in the best interests of fairness to the opposing party in the interference, of conservation of judicial and administrative time and energy, and of protection of the public from the obvious evils of interfering patent claims, that the applicant, as to such claims, should not have a second day in court.

I wish to point out that strict application of the so-called doctrine of “estoppel” tends to put a tremendous burden on an applicant who wishes to protect his priority rights to all subject matter to which he is lawfully entitled. First, he must be able to tell, once and for all, <em>'precisely </em>what subject matter is <em>adequately supported </em>by the disclosures of <em>both </em>parties to the interference. Second, he must be able to tell whether any of that subject matter is <em>patentably distinct </em>from existing interference counts. And he <em>must </em>be correct, upon pain of losing any rights he might have to subject matter concerning which he is in error. This seems to me a very unrealistic set of requirements to impose upon an applicant who becomes involved in an interference, since the questions of patentable distinction and support are among the most difficult in patent law.
