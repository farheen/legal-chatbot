The Football Club was a member of the National Football League (“NFL”), an unincorporated, non-profit association of member clubs that own and operate professional football teams. As a member of the NFL, the Football Club shared in a percentage of the revenues received by the NFL from its contracts with major television networks (“Network Contracts”) for the right to televise NFL football games.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Under the Network Contracts, the networks had the exclusive right to broadcast the live telecasts of NFL football games, and the NFL received payments from the networks, referred to as media receipts, which were divided evenly among the NFL teams.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The City audited the Football Club for tax years 1986 through 1992, and issued a notice of assessment on April 22, 1994. In response to the City’s audit assessment of the BPT, on June 3, 1994, the Football Club filed a Review Petition with the Philadelphia Tax Review Board (“Board”), seeking relief from the City’s assessments of the BPT, which totaled $730,705.39 for the years 1986 through 1992.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Football Club subsequently filed a Refund Petition with the Board on October 5, 1994, seeking a refund of $250,197.00 in BPT taxes that it had paid for the years 1986 through 1992. The Football Club claimed an overpayment of BPT taxes due to the erroneous calculation of the percentage of the media receipts that should have been included in its gross receipts for purposes of calculating its BPT liability. Specifically, the Football Club argued that only 50% of the media receipts, rather than 100% of the media receipts, should have been subject to the BPT calculations because only half of the Eagles Team’s football games were played in and broadcast from Philadelphia. The Board held hearings on the Football Club’s petitions from December 14, 1995 to September 24,1996.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The Board determined that the media receipts constituted fees for services rendered, i.e., fees for the playing of football games by the Eagles Team. Because the Eagles Team played one-half of its football games in Philadelphia and one-half of its games in other cities, the Board concluded that one-half of the Football Club’s media receipts were subject to the BPT as fees for services rendered in Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Specifically, the Court of Common Pleas reversed the Board’s conclusion that the Football Club’s media receipts were fees for services rendered, and instead, found as a matter of law that those receipts were copyright royalties resulting from the licensing of a property right. The court further concluded that 100% of those copyright royalties were subject to the BPT under Section 322 of the BPT Regulations, which, as indicated above, allocates all copyright royalties to the City if the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in Philadelphia. The Court of Common Pleas affirmed the Board’s decision in all other respects.</p>

In doing so, the Commonwealth Court held that the Football Club’s gross media receipts from the television broadcast of the Eagles Team’s football games were copyright royalties subject to the BPT. The Commonwealth Court further concluded that the City did not violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by failing to apportion the media receipts to account for football games played outside of Philadelphia. According to the Commonwealth Court, because income from copyright royalties is properly allocated to the domiciliary situs of the taxpayer, and because the Football Club was commercially domiciled in Philadelphia, 100% of the media receipts were subject to taxation by the City under the gross receipts portion of the BPT. The Football Club subsequently filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal to this Court raising a total of four issues.</p>

The Network Contracts clearly treat the arrangement between the parties as the transfer of the right to broadcast the live telecast of football games played by the NFL teams to the networks. Specifically, section 1 of the Network Contracts, entitled “Television Rights Transferred,” gave the networks exclusive “over-the-air broadcast telecasting rights” to specific NFL games scheduled to be telecast. <em>See </em>NFL/NBC Contract, pp. 1-2, R.R., vol. 2, at 782a-783a. In return, the NFL received rights fees from the network, which were paid in periodic installments in accordance with an agreed upon schedule. <em>See id., </em>p. 22, at 803a; <em>see also </em>Letter from NFL to NBC Network, 2/14/91, R.R., vol. 2, at 781a (in exchange for right to televise NFL games, network “will pay rights fees to the [NFL] member clubs”).

Rather, the broadcast of the games was the crux of the contract, as evidenced by the fact that a football game only reached its true value by being telecast. The Football Club, as a member of the NFL, was only paid media receipts pursuant to the contractual provisions granting the networks the exclusive right to telecast the games.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> The Network Contracts specifically provided that if for any reason beyond the network’s control a game was played but was not telecast by the network, and no other NFL game telecast could be substituted, the media receipts due the NFL would be reduced by the network’s out-of-pocket production costs and the advertising revenues that needed to be refunded in connection with the canceled telecast. <em>See id., </em>p. 8, at 789a.

If the images and sounds to be broadcast are first recorded (on a video tape, film, etc.) and then transmitted, the recorded work would be considered a ‘motion picture’ subject to statutory protection against unauthorized reproduction or retransmission of the broadcast. If the program content is transmitted five to the public while being recorded at the same time, the case would be treated the same; the copyright owner would not be forced to rely on common law rather than statutory rights in proceeding against an infringing user of the live broadcast.

As an initial matter, the Football Club offers no proof for its argument that the assignment only occurred after the games were broadcast. Moreover, the Football Club’s argument in this regard is contrary to the clear language of the Network Contracts, which deemed the NFL and its member teams the owner of the copyrights when the parties signed the contracts and not, as the Football Club argues, after the telecasts. Finally, the Football Club’s argument apparently is based on the erroneous proposition that there is a copyright in the one-time live broadcast and a separate copyright protecting against subsequent replays of the live telecast, i.e., the tape of the football game. As explained above, however, the right to broadcast a live event is one of the bundle of rights that comes with copyright ownership. If the live broadcast of an NFL football game is simultaneously taped, the author owns the bundle of rights attendant to copyright unless, as in the instant case, the author assigns those rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_30" id="ref_footnote_1_30">30</a> Having assigned ownership of these copyrights to the NFL, the networks then obtained from the NFL the exclusive right to broadcast the live telecasts of NFL football games. <em>See </em>NFL/NBC Contract. p. 2, R.R., vol. 2, at 783a; <em>cf.

Indeed, the Football Club admits as much when it argues that it is "industry practice” for the networks to assign to the NFL the copyright on live broadcasts as part of their broadcasting contracts.

While it is true that there could be no copyright ownership without an author, the above discussion clearly shows that one need not author a work in order to obtain copyright ownership of that work, and therefore, the Football Club’s argument in this regard is simply meritless.</p>

Thus, under the 1909 Act, the Football Club’s argument that the networks could not have assigned ownership of a copyright until <em>after </em>a live football game was finished and, as a result, completely recorded, might have some validity.

In a related argument, the City asserts that its assessment of 100% of the Football Club's receipts was constitutional because it was done in accordance with Regulation 322, which provides that where a taxpayer maintains its commercial domicile in Philadelphia, "all patent, copyright, and trademark royalties received are to be included in the measure of the tax,” unless "attributable to business conducted at a place of business regularly maintained by the taxpayer outside of Philadelphia.” BPT Regulations § 322. The City claims that because the Football Club was domiciled in Philadelphia, and failed to show that it maintained a regular place of business elsewhere, the City properly levied the BPT upon 100% of the media receipts under Regulation 322. However, the fact that the City created such a rule for its own regulations does not exempt the City from adhering to the constitutional mandate to fairly apportion revenue generated from interstate business activities. Just as the City seeks to collect its fair share of revenue from businesses operating in its jurisdiction, whether or not a particular business actually maintains an office in Philadelphia, it cannot deny a taxpayer "the right to a division of the tax base, merely because the taxpayer has not established an office outside the state, if the taxpayer is carrying on other activities ... that will subject it to income tax in those other states.” Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein, 2 <em>State Taxation, supra, </em>¶ 8.02[4][c],</p>

We emphasize that the City’s application of Regulation 322, and not the BPT in its entirety, violated the external consistency test. The BPT contains an explicit apportionment formula instituting a geographical limitation on the gross receipts portion of the BPT, <em>see </em>Philadelphia Code § 19-2601 ("taxable receipts” limited to those receipts earned in Philadelphia), but Regulation 322 does not contain a corresponding limitation. By employing Regulation 322 to tax revenues earned from the live broadcasts originating outsidé Philadelphia, the City taxed beyond the borders of its jurisdiction, and the City’s imposition of the BPT in this manner was not rationally related to its power and interest. Despite the City’s assertion that there is "no rational basis" for limiting the imposition of the BPT to one-half of the Eagles Team’s games, we find that the only media receipts that had a rational relationship the taxing jurisdiction were those that were generated from the games played and broadcast live from Philadelphia.</p>

At issue here is the second prong of that test, which requires that the local tax be fairly apportioned. <em><a href="/us/430/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="248" data-cite="430 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="12123142" data-case-paths="/us/430/0274-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/430/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="248" data-cite="430 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="12123142" data-case-paths="/us/430/0274-01">at 279</a>, <a href="/us/430/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="249" data-cite="430 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="12123142" data-case-paths="/us/430/0274-01">97 S.Ct. 1076</a>. To be deemed fairly apportioned, a tax must be both internally and externally consistent. <em>Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., </em><a href="/us/514/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="250" data-cite="514 U.S. 175" data-case-ids="1338997" data-case-paths="/us/514/0175-01">514 U.S. 175</a>, 185, <a href="/us/514/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="251" data-cite="115 S.

A tax is internally consistent where the imposition of an identical tax by every other state would impose no additional burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear. <em><a href="/us/514/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="253" data-cite="514 U.S. 175" data-case-ids="1338997" data-case-paths="/us/514/0175-01">Id.</a> </em>I agree with the plurality that the Philadelphia BPT unquestionably is internally consistent.</p>

Because the royalties are taxable only by the domicile, it follows that the BPT taxes only revenues attributable to economic activity within Philadelphia. The copyright royalties are the intangible <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>property of the Eagles Football Club, and, as such, they follow the Club. Those royalties are distributed among the member teams of the NFL upon an equal basis— l/28th to each of the 28 teams operating in different cities — and not premised upon which games are played where. In short, in my view, the deciding factor for copyright royalty purposes is not the underlying activity of playing football, the gate receipts or the location of the game, because those factors are not relevant to team ownership and thus the situs of the copyrights. The situs of the copyrights in this case clearly is Philadelphia. Philadelphia has not sought to reach any of the other 27/28ths of the media receipts paid to the NFL, but only that portion which has been paid to the single Philadelphia corporation.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[154,1306,755,1373]],["BL_185.5",185,[957,270,754,300]]]'>The plurality’s focus upon game-day to further subdivide the one twenty-eighth share of the media receipts each NFL club receives not only ignores the deemed situs of the copyrights but is also, in my view, both artificial and impractical. Even if game-day is deemed the proper focus, it is indisputable that l/28th of the NFL activity generating the media royalties occurs in Philadelphia since other cities’ NFL teams play in Philadelphia at the Eagles’ home games. Thus, Philadelphia properly may tax up to l/28th of the media royalties paid to the NFL — not coincidentally, the very amount paid to the Eagles Football Club, which hosted l/28th of NFL regular season games. The plurality’s approach would require the City of Philadelphia to tax that portion of media receipts of other NFL teams attributable to games they played in Philadelphia (one-sixteenth of their media receipts for each game they played here), while assuming that other NFL cities would be permitted to tax visiting NFL teams’ royalties in the same fashion. Calculation and collection of those taxes would require considerable effort on the part of the cities in which NFL games are played, inevitably would result in disputes and litigation over the imposition of taxes by cities in which the NFL teams are not commercially domiciled, and would lead to unevenness in application.</p>
    <p id="b185-7" data-blocks='[["BL_185.6",185,[955,600,755,291]]]'>Because I believe the BPT was properly assessed against the Eagles Football Club by the City of Philadelphia based upon the media royalties actually paid to it in its domicile, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court’s decision.</p>
