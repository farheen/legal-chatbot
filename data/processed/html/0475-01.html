    <p id="b534-16" data-blocks='[["BL_534.16",534,[1006,240,753,702]]]'>Appellant assaulted a speech and hearing-impaired woman in her home throughout the night of August 20, 1992. Appellant pled guilty, on December 9, 1993, to indecent assault and criminal trespass. Other charges against him, including rape, burglary, theft, receiving stolen property, and false imprisonment, were withdrawn. The lower court sentenced appellant on April 29, 1994. On May 27, 1994, appellant filed a petition for reconsideration. The lower court did not render a decision on this motion. On June 16, 1994, appellant filed a notice of appeal in the lower court. In his brief on appeal, appellant raises one issue for this court’s consideration:</p>
    <blockquote id="AO-" data-blocks='[["BL_534.17",534,[1041,966,718,611]]]'>Whether the court below abused its discretion in departing from the sentencing guidelines, in that it improperly considered the defendant’s prior conviction record and withdrawn felony charges as reasons for departing from the guidelines, in that it did not make a contemporaneous statement of the permissible range of sentences under the guidelines and appears not to have used the correct range, and in that it did not articulate a justifiable reason for departing from the sentencing guidelines with respect to criminal trespass.</blockquote>

Although sentencing took place after January 1, 1994, appellant’s plea of guilty would constitute the determination of guilt. Since this occurred prior to January 1, 1994, appellant was required to file his appeal within thirty days of the judgment of sentence. Judgment of sentence was rendered on April 29, 1994 and was entered on the docket on May 6, 1994. Appellant did not file his notice of appeal until June 16, 1994, more than thirty days after the judgment of sentence. Therefore, the appeal is untimely.</p>
