On May 17, 1987, Plaintiff Christopher Noll, then 17 years of age, dove from a starting block into a swimming pool at the West Shore Branch of the YMCA. Noll dove into 3 and Jé feet of water and suffered quadriplegic injuries. This starting block was manufactured and sold by co-defendant Sta-Rite. Plaintiffs commenced this action against Sta-Rite and co-defendant Harrisburg YMCA by Complaint filed on September 8, 1988. Sta-Rite filed its answer with new matter on February 16, 1989 raising the defenses of assumption of risk, comparative negligence, substantial change of the product, and misuse of the product. It did not plead the statute of repose as a defense. On March 19, 1991, three years later, Sta-Rite filed a Motion for Leave to Amend New Matter to plead the statute of repose. The trial court held that starting blocks were not improvements to real estate, and, therefore, Sta-Rite could not assert the affirmative defense of the statute of repose. The case was appealed to the Superior Court which held that the starting block’s status as an improvement depended on the intent of the YMCA in installing the blocks. The Superior Court remanded the ease for an evidentiary hearing to determine the intent of the YMCA. Plaintiff and co-defendant Sta-Rite both petitioned this court for an allowance of appeal which we granted.</p>

In <em>Schaffer, </em>the Superior Court considered this very issue and held that refusal to allow a defendant to amend his answer to include the defense of the statute of repose was a final appealable order.

Thus, we do not exclude manufacturers from the statute’s protection as a matter of law. We find the instant case is one in which a manufacturer supplied “individual expertise” to the design of an improvement. The record in this case demonstrates that the dimensions of this pool included an “unusual” deck to water dimension of 12 inches. (R.R. at 75A). The pool contractor, Paddock Pool Builders, ordered diving blocks from Sta-Rite and included drawings of the pool which related to the unusual deck to water height. (R.R. at 79A). Sta-Rite shipped the Diving Blocks with an invoice which read “per their drawing.” (R.R. at 74a). We recognize that the block which was shipped was a standard stock item (R.R. at 80A). However, Sta-Rite was required to examine the drawings including the unusual deck to water height prior to shipping the diving blocks. Even if Sta-Rite did no more than examine the drawings and determine that its standard product was appropriate with modifications, as appears was the case in the instant situation, Sta-Rite expended “individual expertise” and was involved with the design of the alleged improvement. Thus, under the unique facts of this case, we conclude that Sta-Rite is within the class protected by the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

However, this is our argument precisely. The concurrence is apparently under the impression that our holding today rests on the belief that Sta-Rite expended “individual expertise” in the manufacturing of its product— the starting blocks themselves.

Upon review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in finding the diving platforms were not improvements and thus denying Sta-Rite’s motion to amend. The record shows that the diving platforms were not permanently attached to the pool. <em>See </em>R.R. at 86A-88A, 90A-92A. The diving platforms were attached to the pool by two “T-handles” that could be unscrewed without the use of any tools. R.R. at 86A. Removing the diving platforms did not require any special skill and was often done by parents and coaches conducting swimming meets. R.R. at 88A, 92A. The platforms were, in fact, moved for swimming meets and cleaning on frequent occasions. R.R. at 91A-92A. In fact, the starting blocks were advertised by Sta-Rite as easily removable. R.R. at 61A. Thus, the record supports the finding that the degree and manner of attachment were such that the blocks were not made a permanent improvement. The diving blocks were easily removable and removal would not cause the pool any damage. The blocks were not necessary or essential to the use of the property as a swimming pool as the pool could be used and enjoyed aside from competitive meets. The conduct of the YMCA evidences that they did not intend for the blocks to be a permanent addition to the pool as YMCA employees detached and removed the blocks and allowed parents and swim team coaches to detach and remove the blocks.</p>

The Concurring Opinion suggests that the Majority should not have discussed this prong of the test out of order. We chose to discuss this prong of the test out of order due to the recentness and importance of <em>McConnaughey </em>which was handed down only weeks before our consideration of this case. The Concunring Opinion also asserts that our discussion is dictum. We disagree as we believe that <em>McConnaughey, </em>which was pending during the argument of the instant case and was handed down during our consideration of it, is inextricably tied to the present controversy. The parties have consistently argued the principles underlying <em>McConnaughey </em>without benefit of that decision. Further, it was our original impulse to decide this case solely on the principles of <em>McConnaughey </em>prior to our complete understanding of the instant facts. Due to the similarity with <em>McConnaughey, </em>we believe that the bar would have been utterly confused if we had failed to address why the principles set forth in that opinion did not apply here. <em>McConnaughey </em>itself was a plurality opinion which left this area of the law unsettled. While the philosophy of the Concurring Opinion tends to promote judicial economy, we believe that our consideration of <em>McConnaughey, </em>in view of its recent vintage, is only fair to the parties. In addition, we believe that our decision in the instant case will provide the bar with a maximum of guidance on this question and resolves it in accord with a majority of courts and commentators. The approach of the concurrence would leave the issue unsettled and would wait for a third case to finally resolve an issue most courts have managed to resolve in one attempt. This we feel is unwise and would leave the lower courts and the bar in a state of unnecessary confusion. Also, footnote 1 of the Concurring Opinion suggests that this issue was not properly before this court. Our review finds that the parties consistently argued the principles underlying <em>McConnaughey </em>throughout these proceedings.</p>

We find that an objective determination of intent works best for determining whether an object is a fixture for the purposes of the statute of repose. The more traditional context for the law of fixtures is the tenant-landlord or grantee-grantor context. In this situation the tenant or grantee attaches a betterment to the real properly. The question then becomes whether this betterment is a fixture that should pass to the landlord or grantor upon transfer of the land. A more subjective analysis may be required in this context, but this is a question for another day.</p>

    <p id="b155-8" data-blocks='[["BL_155.9",155,[944,663,755,422]]]'>I concur in the Majority’s conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sta-Rite’s Motion to Amend its Answer and New Matter to plead the statute of repose found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5536. More specifically, I agree that Sta-Rite is not entitled to assert the statute of repose because the starting blocks it manufactured are not improvements to real property.</p>
    <p id="b155-9" data-blocks='[["BL_155.10",155,[944,1112,755,277]]]'>I write separately for two distinct reasons. First, given its disposition of the improvement issue, I do not believe that the Majority should have discussed the remaining two requirements for protection under the statute of repose. As the Majority correctly states,</p>
    <blockquote id="Am" data-blocks='[["BL_155.11",155,[978,1408,718,419]]]'>A party moving for protection under the statute of repose must show: (1) what is supplied is an improvement to real property; (2) more than twelve years have elapsed between the completion of the improvements to the real estate and the injury; and (3) the activity of the moving party must be within the class which is protected by the statute.</blockquote>
    <p id="b155-10" data-blocks='[["BL_155.12",155,[940,1851,755,699]]]'>(Majority Opinion at pp. 84-85 (citations omitted).) The moving party must satisfy all three prongs of this test. Therefore, the Majority’s conclusion that the starting blocks are not improvements to real <em>property </em>— i.e., that Sta-Rite does not satisfy the first prong of the test — should have ended the inquiry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The remainder of the Majority’s discussion thus is not necessary to the result and must be viewed as <em>dicta. </em>Had the three prongs been addressed in the stated order — rather than out of order, as the Majority has chosen to address them — the superfluity of the discussion of prongs two and three would have been obvious.</p>

      <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>Second, I respectfully disagree with the substance of the Majority’s analysis with respect to the third prong: whether the activity of Sta-Rite is within the class protected by the statute. The Majority’s insistence on addressing this prong, despite its finding that the product supplied is not an improvement, has caused it to distort the analysis of the “activity” prong by taking that prong out of context. As a result, the Majority’s attempt to clarify the Court’s recent pronouncements in <em>McConnaughey v. Building Components, Inc., </em>— Pa. -, <a href="/pa/536/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="637 A.2d 1331" data-case-ids="1843176,7372025" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0095-01,/a2d/637/1331-01">637 A.2d 1331</a> (1994), only serves to obfuscate the issue.</p>
    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[206,884,750,77]]]'>In <em>McConnaughey, </em>the Court explained that</p>
    <blockquote id="b156-7" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[241,979,722,860]]]'>the statute only protects the acts of those persons <em>involved </em>in the <em>design, planning, supervision, construction or observation of the construction of an improvement to real property itself. </em>When a manufacturer does nothing more than supply the component products for an improvement to real property, the manufacturer is not protected by the statute. The fact that a manufacturer designs and plans the component products which later are incorporated into an improvement to real property is irrelevant under the statute. The Pennsylvania statute of repose was not intended to apply to manufacturers and suppliers of products, but only to the kinds of economic actors who perform acts of “individual expertise” akin to those commonly thought to be performed by builders.</blockquote>

    <p id="b156-13" data-blocks='[["BL_156.9",156,[1006,231,753,1448]]]'>Thus, the final prong focuses not just on the “activity,” performed in the abstract, but on the activity performed <em>in relation to the real property. </em>To provide an admittedly extreme illustration of my point: while a dressmaker, for example, might be said to perform an act of “individual expertise” in designing and constructing a garment, it would be ridiculous to engage in a discussion of whether his or her activities fall within the class protected by the statute of repose. The dressmaker’s acts simply are not performed “in relation to an improvement to real property.” By addressing whether Sta-Rite provided “individual expertise” in supplying an item that it determines is <em>not </em>an improvement to real property, the Majority sets up a contrived discussion that it then must qualify by limiting its application to the “unique facts of this case.” (Majority Opinion at p. 86 n. 5.) The Majority first pretends for the sake of discussion that the starting blocks are an “improvement,” referring to them as “the alleged improvement.” <em>(Id. </em>at p. 86.) However, the most that the Majority can conclude following this discussion is that “Sta-Rite actually expended individual expertise <em>in supplying its product.” (Id. </em>at p. 86 n. 5; emphasis added.) No relationship between the activity performed and an improvement to real property is established.</p>

      <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>These statements are founded upon the very basis for the statute of repose. As this Court has explained, the statute draws a rational distinction between suppliers and builders:</p>
    <blockquote id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[181,481,716,942]]]'>Suppliers, who typically produce items by the thousands, can easily maintain high quality-control standards in the controlled environment of the factory. A builder, on the other hand, can pre-test his designs and construction only in limited ways— actual use in the years following construction is their only real test. Further, every building is unique and far more complex than any of its component parts. Even in the most uniform-looking suburban subdivision, each house stands on a separate plot of land; each lot may have slightly different soil conditions; one may be near an underground stream; and so forth. The Legislature can rationally conclude that the conditions under which builders work are sufficiently difficult that limitations should be placed on their liabilities, but not on the liabilities of suppliers.</blockquote>
