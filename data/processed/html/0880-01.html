The officer asked appellant, who was seated behind the wheel, for his name. Officer LeBlanc, who acknowledged in his testimony that he was not proficient in Spanish beyond “a vocabulary [that] might last twenty words,” addressed appellant in English. Appellant was eventually taken to the police station. As Officer LeBlanc prepared to read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (also in English), he gave appellant the choice of “reading along” with him from a “rights card” available in either English or Spanish; appellant elected to read the Spanish version. Officer LeBlanc testified that he had no reason to believe that appellant did not understand spoken English, but that he was not sure that appellant, who was originally from Honduras, knew how to read English. Appellant answered all the questions asked of him on the card and never indicated that he had any difficulty in understanding those questions.</p>
    <p id="b930-12" data-blocks='[["BL_930.11",930,[985,1933,751,299]],["BL_931.1",931,[173,253,753,395]]]'>In court Officer LeBlanc identified the rights card, with <em>Miranda </em>warnings printed in Spanish, that he gave to appellant at the police station. Appellant had written the answer “yes” in English next to each of the <em>Miranda </em>questions that were print<a id="p883" href="#p883" data-label="883" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*883</a>ed on the card in Spanish, and both appellant and the officer had signed the card. Although affirmative responses by appellant to all the card’s questions effectively waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and indicated his willingness to talk to the police, Officer LeBlanc did not speak to him further at that time.</p>
    <p id="b931-5" data-blocks='[["BL_931.6",931,[174,684,753,871]]]'>About three hours later, Officers Le-Blanc and Vernelli<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> began to interview appellant. Before any questions were asked, Officer Vernelli read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in English to appellant from a “suspect-defendant statement form,” which was on a clipboard that the officer was holding in his hand. At the top of the form, as Officer LeBlanc described it, there was a printed version of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, “the same as what’s on the rights card.” Appellant acknowledged his understanding of what Officer Vernelli had just told him by writing his initials on the form, “just below the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,” thereby waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights once again.</p>

Appellant replied that he had agreed to buy the car and its accompanying plates from another man for $1000, but he did not yet possess the title because he still had not paid for the car. He explained that the tools found in the trunk of the car belonged to him and that he needed them. He also disavowed any knowledge of a second set of license plates discovered inside the trunk, emphasizing that he had had the car in his possession for only two days. As Officer LeBlanc continued the questioning, Officer Vernelli wrote down each question and the ensuing response. Officer LeBlanc testified that he deliberately asked his questions slowly, so that Officer Vernelli would have ample time to transcribe the conversation “word for word.” When the interview was completed, Officer Vernelli copied his notes into a three-page document, then gave it to appellant and asked him “to take a look at the statement to make sure that it coincided with what he answered.... And if it did, to go ahead and sign the bottom of it.” After reading it over for “a couple of minutes,” appellant signed the statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

After discovering that this car was stolen, Officer LeBlanc removed appellant from the car and asked him, in English, “You knew this car was stolen, didn’t you?” When appellant replied that he did, he was taken into custody. Some time later, in the processing room at the police station, the officer asked appellant the “standard booking questions,” and he did not appear to have any difficulty in answering them. After processing him, Officer LeBlanc read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights again in English. Appellant did not give any indication of not understanding the exchange, responding “yes” in English, both orally and in writing, to all the questions asked on the back of an English-language rights card, thereby waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>

The “read along” practice, he said, was merely a personal policy that he followed on his own, in order to reassure a suspect in custody that he was “not making something up.” Immediately after the <em>Miranda </em>exchange, Officer LeBlanc and appellant had a brief conversation, during which appellant once more admitted that he knew the car was stolen.</p>

If an arrested person indicated, that he or she could not communicate in English or spoke English only “a little bit,” the interview would be immediately stopped until a court interpreter arrived. Mr. Fish would also mark the case folder with a note — which appellant’s file did not contain — stating, “Spanish interpreter, Spanish speaking only.” Even in the absence of this safeguard, a non-English speaker would simply be unable to complete the interview in English, and thus, as a matter of policy, Mr. Fish would stop the interview and seek an interpreter as soon as any confusion arose. Appellant’s file did not indicate that there had been any difficulties but instead reflected a completed interview in “every single aspect,” with the notation that appellant had provided “detailed information.”</p>

If appellant had indicated any language difficulty, Pretrial Services would have assigned him a Spanish-speaking case manager.

These were complete sentences inquiring of subject matter, and Mr. Torres’ responses were given in English, not in Spanish, to Officer LeBlanc, who indicated that he really doesn’t have anything but almost a less than rudimentary knowledge of Spanish.</blockquote>

A “communication-impaired person” is defined to include a “non-English speaking person” who is “unable to readily understand oral and written communications in the English language or who cannot communicate effectively in the spoken English language.” D.C.Code § 2-1901(2), 2-1901(4); <em>see Gonzalez v.

Upon appellant’s first arrest on July 24, after learning that he was a native of Honduras, Officer LeBlanc provided a Spanish rights card to ensure that appellant would be able to “read along” while he gave appellant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings in English. The “read along” practice was not required by police department procedures, but Officer LeBlanc testified that he followed it nevertheless to reassure those in custody that he was “not making something up.” Although, as the trial judge noted, “complexities” inherent in “cultural differences” might exist, Officer LeBlanc’s personal policy surely helped to dispel, or at least minimize, the “compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings.” <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 458, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="86 S.

    <p id="b935-8" data-blocks='[["BL_935.9",935,[976,995,756,870]]]'>At the time of appellant’s second arrest on July 28, the officer admittedly did not give appellant the opportunity to “read along” in Spanish during the <em>Miranda </em>administration, but that was because Officer Le Blanc already “knew him to speak English.” At no time on either July 24 or July 28 did appellant appear confused, express a lack of understanding, or request the assistance of a translator or interpreter. Appellant therefore cannot, by any conceivable reading of the facts before us, show that he is “unable to readily understand oral and written communications in the English language or [to] communicate effectively in the spoken English language.” D.C.Code § 2-1901(4).</p>

Appellant did not evince any signs of confusion or lack of understanding throughout several interactions with the police and Pretrial Services personnel. On July 24 alone, for instance, appellant twice waived his Miranda rights by responding affirmatively to the questions on the rights card. Officer LeBlanc, however, did not speak to him for another three hours. At that time, appellant was presented with a fresh waiver form on which he again indicated his willingness to speak to the police. <a id="p888" href="#p888" data-label="888" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*888</a>He waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights again after his second arrest four days later, on July 28. Although that fact is not dispositive, since the instant appeal arises only from a conviction based on the events of July 24, his ready answers to the police questions — in English — on July 28 support the trial court’s determination that he was able to communicate effectively in English on July 24.</p>

Determining whether someone qualifies as a non-English speaker entitled to an interpreter’s services may, in some cases, pose a difficult question that turns upon “a variety of factors,” including that person’s “understanding of the English language, and the complexity of the proceedings, issues, and testimony.” <em>Gonzalez, </em><a href="/a2d/697/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="697 A.2d 819" data-case-ids="12020334" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/0819-01">697 A.2d at 825</a>. But such a challenging question is not presented here. Moreover, in cases involving similar determinations under the Act, we have held that the trial court should be afforded “wide discretion” in making its rulings. <em><a href="/a2d/697/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="697 A.2d 819" data-case-ids="12020334" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/0819-01">Id.</a> </em>Because the record contains substantial evidence that appellant was not impaired as a “non-English speaking person,” we conclude that there was no abuse of the court’s discretion.</p>
