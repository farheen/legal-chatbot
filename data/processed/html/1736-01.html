The applications in those appeals relate to detonation of a nuclear device in a subterranean salt cavern to produce radioactive isotopes and steam to be used for surface power. It is disclosed in the applications at bar that a “serious problem is encountered” in underground nuclear explosions of the above nature in salt formations. When a nuclear device is detonated in a gaseous or liquid medium, destructive forces tend to he generated due to transmission of high energy shock waves from the situs of the explosion. The shock wave <a id="p1737" href="#p1737" data-label="1737" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1737</a>may strike the walls of the cavern, causing cave-ins, spalling or other damage to the walls.

For example, a conventional so-called fire fighting foam prepared by the interaction of a strong mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid, with an aqueous solution containing sodium bicarbonate and a foam-stabilizing material, such as sodium aluminium sulfate, will provide a foam having a specific density of about 0.1 to about 0.01 gm cm-3 and a foam life which may be substantially infinite inasmuch as the foam will dry to a solid.

In discussing ways of solving the problem, the reference states there “might be” a possibility of filling the cavity with some material that would absorb the shock before the walls are struck by the explosion.
