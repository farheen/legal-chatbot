After hearing argument, we have concluded that, despite the procedural error, dismissal would be inappropriate because of the grave constitutional issues involved in this case. Accordingly, treating plaintiff’s appeal as a petition for statutory certiorari filed pursuant to the provisions of G.L. 1956 (1977 Reenactment) § 42-35-16, said petition for certiorari is hereby granted.</p>
