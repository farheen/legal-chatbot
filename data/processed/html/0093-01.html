      <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>The facts of this case are as follows, to-wit: On the 21st day of January 1861, the Inferior Court of Sumter county passed an order in due form, in which it was recited, that “It appearing to the Court that James Wicker built a bridge across Camp creek, at and for the price of one dollar and forty-five cents per foot, under contract with the Inferior Court of said county, and that said bridge is three hundred and fifty feet long, and that said work and materials are worth the sum of §507 <em>50. </em>It is therefore, ordered by the Court, that the treasurer of said county of Sumter, pay James Wicker, $507 50, out of any moneys not otherwise appropriated.” The order was duly entered on the minutes of the Court as required by law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[250,1051,1151,449]]]'>On the day the order bears date Wicker presented it to the treasurer and received the sum of $200 00 as part payment thereof, and afterwards for a valuable consideration sold and assigned the order to Robert Carver. Carver died, and John M. Greer administered on his estate. Carver in his lifetime, and Greer since his death, presented the order to Speer, the county treasurer of said county, and demanded payment of the principal and interest due on the order, and payment was refused.</p>
