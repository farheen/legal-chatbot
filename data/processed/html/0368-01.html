Thus, attempting to lure a child into a motor vehicle is defined as taking a substantial step towards luring a child into a motor vehicle without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In particular, K.L. was walking in the area of 402 Cassidy Court wearing a tube-top, knee-length red and white sun dress. KL. was en route home when a dark gray SUV approached her. The driver, later identified as Appellant, asked if she knew where Brooke Lynn Meadows was situated. KL. replied in the negative. Appellant then drove around the block before asking K.L. the identical question. KL.’s response was the same.</p>

When KL. asked Appellant what he meant, he said, “If you help me find this place, I will give you a hundred dollars.” N.T. (Non-Jury Trial), 7/29/05, at 14. K.L. declined the offer, to which Appellant said, ‘Well, you don’t like spending money?” <em>Id. </em>at 14. At this point, a vehicle pulled behind Appellant’s SUV, which required him to move, but not before he told K.L., “Stay here. I will be right back.” <em>Id. </em>at 15. By the time Appellant returned, KL. made her way to a nearby house and told the owner and a neighbor of Appellant’s behavior. The police were phoned <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>and dispatched to investigate an “attempted abduction of a juvenile female.” <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>

An immediate search of the area produced the vehicle. Detective Hor-ner, of the Northern Berks police department, knocked on the building adjacent to where the SUV was parked. Appellant granted the detective access, and he admitted contacting a girl walking along the side of the road within minutes of the detective’s arrival. Thereafter, Appellant was transported to police headquarters, waived his rights and admitted “his intentions were [.-..] to have sex with .the girl and that he was going to pay her $100[.]” N.T. (Non-Jury Trial), 7/29/05, at 34. Appellant also gave a written statement indicating that the female victim “appeared to be 18 or 19 years old[.]” <em>See </em>Commonwealth’s Exhibit No. 1.</p>

Although the trial court states in its Opinion that “the evidence, in no uncertain terms, clearly establishes that [Appellant] was fully aware of the fact that his young companion was a minor,” (Trial Ct. Op. at 7), this finding is contradicted by the Appellant’s acquittal on the charge of corruption of minors based on his testimony that he reasonably believed [the minor child/victim] to be over the age of 18. Indeed, a photograph of the victim at the time of the incident included among the trial exhibits makes evident why the trial judge would credit Appellant’s mistake of age defense. This credibility determination makes ludicrous the court’s subsequent finding that Appellant “knew he was dealing with a minor.” <em>(Id.). </em>Moreover, the fact that Appellant may have learned later in the evening that [the minor child/victim] was only 17 years old is irrelevant. By that time, [the minor <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>child/victim] had already entered Appellant’s R.V. with him and begun drinking.</blockquote>

N.T. (Non-Jury Trial), 7/29/05, at 17-21. The trial court observed KL.’s appearance and found her to be “substantially younger than eighteen at the time of trial.
