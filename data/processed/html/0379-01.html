At her request, she was then furloughed. Subsequently, on March 24, 1993, the Commission found that Pisano was improperly furloughed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and entered the following order:</p>

Pisa-no argued in briefs before the Commission <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>that the March 24 order required DER to subtract from her back pay the actual wages and benefits she received, not, as DER did, to subtract the wages she <em>would have </em>earned had she remained in the administrative assistant position. On consideration of the stipulation and both parties’ briefs, the Commission made a finding that DER “has complied with the Commission’s March 24, 1993 Order .... ” Hence, the Commission declined to grant the relief Pisano requested in her petition for enforcement.</p>
    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[188,820,750,611]]]'>On appeal to this Court, Pisano contends that the Commission erred in not concluding that the question of whether her damages were to be mitigated according to DER’s calculation was decided by the Commission’s March 24, 1993 reinstatement order, which was final and not appealed by DER. Thus, Pisano argues, DER is bound by that order to calculate the amount of back pay damages by taking her <em>actual </em>earnings and unemployment compensation and deducting them from her gross earnings in the Administrative Officer position.</p>
    <p id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[187,1454,749,514]]]'>On the other hand, DER argues that it complied with the March 24 order by reinstating Pisano to her original position and, applying the correct principles of mitigation, compensating Pisano to full wages: that is— back salary calculated as the difference between the salary Pisano would have received as Administrative Officer 1 and the salary she would have received as Administrative Assistant 1 had she not chosen to relinquish that position.</p>

Res judicata applies, when certain conditions are present, to bar the relitigation of the same cause of action, <em>City of Pittsburgh v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/522/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="522 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1818944" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0044-01">522 Pa. 44</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="522 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1818944" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0044-01">559 A.2d 896</a> (1989); collateral estop-pel bars the’relitigation of an already judicially determined issue in a subsequent cause of action, <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Duffield, </em><a href="/pa/537/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="537 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="775521" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0485-01">537 Pa. 485</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="644 A.2d 1186" data-case-ids="775521,7881958" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0485-01,/a2d/644/1186-01">644 A.2d 1186</a> (1994). In seeking enforcement of the Commission’s March 24 order, Pisano was prosecuting the <em>same </em>cause of action she brought in her original petition to the Commission, in which she sought reinstatement and back pay. The question of how back pay was to be calculated was never litigated until the enforcement petition was brought. Hence, we find that neither doctrine is availing to Pisano.</p>
    <p id="b439-13" data-blocks='[["BL_439.10",439,[985,975,749,322]]]'>However, we do not agree that the Commission’s decision is legally correct. We return to the clear language of the order that was to be enforced, which directs DER to reimburse Pisano for wages and emoluments since her last day of work as an administrative officer at DER “less any wages <em>earned</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b439-14" data-blocks='[["BL_439.11",439,[984,1308,748,421]]]'>and benefits received-” The order does not state that DER should subtract wages Pisano <em>could have </em>received. Moreover, as the parties stipulated, Pisano filed a sworn statement as directed by the March 24 reinstatement order. That statement was an affidavit of the wages Pisano earned and the benefits she received, consistent with the language of the order.</p>
    <blockquote id="b439-16" data-blocks='[["BL_439.12",439,[1020,1742,711,323]]]'>[Pisano] filed with [DER] the affidavit <em>required under the Order </em>setting forth all wages earned and unemployment compensation received during the period of [Pisa-no’s] furlough.

DER did not take exception to this ruling. The Commission, on reconsideration <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>of its earlier order, directed DER to reinstate Pisano to her original position with back pay as indicated — wages and emoluments since her last day of work as an administrative officer, less wages earned and benefits received. If DER believed the order was incorrect, incomplete or even ambiguous, it should have petitioned for clarification or reconsideration or should have appealed; DER took none of these steps. If DER chose not to challenge the order because it believed it to be subject to but one interpretation, then DER cannot now be heard to say it is not bound by the clear words of that order and will not be allowed to change that order in defense of a petition for enforcement.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[229,1102,750,1002]]]'>This Court recently had occasion to decide a similar case presented to us in the same procedural posture as this one. In <em>Pletz v. Department of Environmental Resources, </em><a href="/a2d/664/1071-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="664 A.2d 1071" data-case-ids="7874779" data-case-paths="/a2d/664/1071-01">664 A.2d 1071</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1995), another improperly furloughed DER employee filed a petition for enforcement of the Commission’s reinstatement with back pay order, contending that DER wrongfully -withheld back pay compensation for the five-month period she was allowed to take sick leave without pay from her alternative employer (as in Pisano’s case, the Department of Public Welfare). We held in that case that DER was not required to reimburse the employee for the period she was on voluntary sick leave because, by thereby making herself unavailable for work, she failed to comply with the rule of law that a complainant in a breach of employment contract action must mitigate her damages. <em><a href="/a2d/664/1071-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="664 A.2d 1071" data-case-ids="7874779" data-case-paths="/a2d/664/1071-01">Id.</a> </em>at -, <a href="/a2d/664/1071-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="664 A.2d 1071" data-case-ids="7874779" data-case-paths="/a2d/664/1071-01">664 A.2d 1071</a>.</p>

First, we said in <em>Pletz </em>that the petitioner failed to comply with the principle of mitigation when she chose to take sick leave without pay. “Once Pletz took such action, she made herself unavailable for work.” <em><a href="/a2d/664/1071-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="664 A.2d 1071" data-case-ids="7874779" data-case-paths="/a2d/664/1071-01">Id.</a> </em>Here, Pisano accepted a demotion in lieu of furlough, then asked to be furloughed, and began receiving unemployment compensation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> until she accepted a position with the Department of Public Welfare, where she remained until the Commission entered its reinstatement order. There is nothing in the record, which consists of the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, that would allow the Commission to find that Pisano made herself unavailable to the work force, and there is no evidence on the question of whether Pisano’s refusal to accept the demotion in lieu of furlough was (or was not) reasonable.</p>
    <p id="b440-9" data-blocks='[["BL_440.9",440,[1028,814,747,661]]]'>Second, in <em>Pletz, </em>DER’s reduction of the petitioner’s back pay actually comported with the express language of the order, (identical in material respects to the one in this case) to reimburse the petitioner for wages and emoluments, less wages earned and benefits received. While the petitioner was on sick leave without pay for over five months, she was not to have received any wages and, if this type <em>of </em>leave is an “emolument,” it is one without remuneration. Thus, unlike in this case, it was the petitioner in <em>Pletz </em>who attempted to <em>modify </em>the order by way of a petition to enforce it.</p>
