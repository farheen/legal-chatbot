McLaughlin was unfit to teach and that his services were unprofitable to the Machias Schools, issued a certificate of dismissal against him, pursuant to 20 M.R.S.A. § 473(4). In accordance with Rule 80B M.R.Civ.P., plaintiff, in December 1974, sought judicial review of the School Committee’s decision by filing a complaint in the Superior Court (Washington County) against the Committee as defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Plaintiff claimed the Committee had unlawfully terminated plaintiff’s employment as a teacher and coach at the Machias Memorial High School. In the course of these proceedings, after various affidavits had been filed, plaintiff moved for summary judgment in his favor. Evaluating plaintiff’s motion, the presiding Justice concluded that defendant, not plaintiff, was entitled to summary judgment and, pursuant to Rule 56(c) M.R.Civ.P., the Justice ordered entry of judgment for defendant. Plaintiff has appealed from said judgment, as entered.</p>

Adverse weather conditions had caused cancellation of a late afternoon soccer practice, and plaintiff had organized the basketball game for the group on a voluntary basis. During the game, while plaintiff was in the act of shooting for a basket, a student pushed plaintiff from behind. Plaintiff immediately turned around and with a single blow of an open hand struck the student on his right cheek bone. The blow caused closure of the student’s mouth and, in consequence, the student lost one of his teeth and suffered serious damage to another tooth. He also sustained a bloody nose and a black eye. After the incident, which lasted only a few seconds, plaintiff administered first aid to the student and drove him home.</p>

He explained that a coach or physical education teacher must teach by example as well as by discussion.</p>

The example set by a coach or physical education teacher is critical to his “overall impact” on impressionable young athletes, particularly at a time when the malady of violence jeopardizes the benefits to be derived from teaching competitive sports. Physical education teachers and coaches of high school athletes and students must have, an exceptional ability to control the emotion, excitement and zeal involved in competitive sporting endeavors. The value of teaching physical education, fair play and good sportsmanship may be permanently impaired when the personal conduct of a teacher-coach conflicts with the message his teaching should impart. The teacher’s actions may speak more loudly than his words. In addition, a single act of violence in the setting of a competitive sport may cause serious injury or provoke a violent response.</p>

Specifically, plaintiff contends that the Committee was biased against him and purported to act, by virtue of the manner in which the Committee’s attorney functioned, as both prosecutor and judge of plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b104-10" data-blocks='[["BL_104.10",104,[1032,1110,752,1288]]]'>We will not give these contentions appellate cognizance because plaintiff did not adequately save them for our appellate scrutiny. Plaintiff did not raise the issues at the proceedings before the School Committee. Plaintiff’s attorney never mentioned the dual role in which the attorney for the School Committee appeared to be acting, and, indeed, he stated expressly that he had no objection to any procedural matters. The failure to raise issues of procedural due process at the hearing before the School Committee ordinarily constitutes a waiver of those issues. See <em>Beattie v.

In the circumstances of this case we conclude that plaintiff acquiesced in all procedural matters related to the hearing before the School Committee.
