Testimony was taken from the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department and the subordinates to whom he had delegated authority to review applications for parade permits. C. Francis Murphy, Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia, also testified, as did two attorneys who were experienced in representing groups seeking parade permits. The police witnesses disclosed that, while there are no written regulations either defining the terms “parade” and “procession” or establishing guidelines to be followed in granting or denying applications for permits, they were guided in their decisions by certain criteria, <em>i. e., </em>permits are denied to groups who intend to disband in an area which is not within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police, if the group does not have a permit for such an area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There is also an informal policy that permits will not be issued to two organizations on the same date, although this has not been followed in every case. To avoid traffic problems, parades and processions are not allowed during the afternoon rush hour. Additionally, a parade permit is issued subject to certain conditions and may be revoked where these conditions are breached or where the police determine that there is a clear and present danger to the public health or safety.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In recent years, applications for parade permits have rarely been denied,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> although requested routes and times have been altered by the police after consultation with the applicants. On one occasion the police refused to grant a parade permit to a group wishing to counter-picket a scheduled march because the police felt it probable that a public confrontation between two opposing groups would cause violent disorder.</p>
    <p id="b544-8" data-blocks='[["BL_544.8",544,[993,453,753,1344]]]'>When questioned as to the definition of a parade or procession, the witnesses gave various responses. There was no agreement among them as to whether pedestrians marching on a sidewalk could constitute a parade or procession, or, if so, whether the determinative factor was how much of the sidewalk was obstructed. One witness suggested that more than a thousand pedestrians on the sidewalk could constitute a parade while another thought a single individual carrying a banner might come within the definition. The Chief of Police testified that police officers present on the scene of alleged violations of Section 107 make the determination of whether or not an unauthorized parade is taking place, but that there are no official guidelines to help them in this task.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Sometimes, for administrative reasons, permits are not delivered to the applicant until shortly before the time when a parade or procession is scheduled to begin, and there are no official procedures concerning the time within which the police must act on an application for a permit, or whether they must give any reasons for denying a permit.</p>

The government also points out that it is the duty of a court, if possible, to construe a statute so as to save it from unconstitutionality, and contends that we should follow the approach taken by the Supreme Courts of New Hampshire and Alabama outlined in Cox v.
