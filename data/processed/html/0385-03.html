      <em>Grant </em>affects the appeal <em>sub judiee </em>in two ways. First, it affects the case directly because appellant is represented by new counsel on appeal and appellant raises numerous claims sounding in the ineffective assistance of trial counsel which were not raised below. Second, <em>Grant </em>affects this case indirectly because there are a number of additional claims raised in this appeal which, though they do not sound in the alleged ineffective assistance' of trial counsel, nevertheless were not raised below. These waived claims of trial court error are reviewable here, if at all, only under this Court’s direct capital appeal relaxed waiver doctrine. For reasons explicated below, we believe that many of the same considerations powering our decision in <em>Grant </em>require a similar reevaluation of the viability of the capital case relaxed waiver doctrine. Although we will still employ the doctrine to reach many of appellant’s waived claims in this case, we abrogate and reshape that doctrine prospectively, so as to better ensure the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice in Pennsylvania.</p>

However, since this is a direct appeal in a capital case, consistently with this Court’s longstanding precedent, we have the discretion to reach claims of trial court error which, though waived, are resolvable from the record. <em>Grant </em>was a non-capital case arising on this Court’s allocatur docket, involving claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness raised for the first time on appeal; accordingly, <em>Grant </em>did not address this Court’s capital appeal relaxed waiver doctrine. Nevertheless, many of the same difficulties that prompted this Court to reexamine and ultimately overrule the <em>Hubbard </em>doctrine in <em>Grant </em>are no less present when this Court considers belated claims of error at trial, raised for the first time on appeal under the capital case relaxed waiver doctrine. <em>Grant </em>held that new claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness are generally better suited for review on collateral attack. We think a similar general rule should govern consideration of claims of trial court error in capital cases that were not raised before the trial court.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>These difficulties “prompted] us to revisit the continued validity of <em>Hubbard.” Id. </em>In that consideration, we noted that the general preference in the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions was to defer review of counsel ineffectiveness claims until collateral review. <em>Id. </em>We also noted the difficult task facing appellate counsel, in the wake of <em>Hubbard, </em>in attempting to uncover and develop extra-record claims of counsel ineffectiveness in the truncated time frame available on direct appeal review, a task further complicated by the fact that counsel’s duty in this regard is not entirely clear, at least as a constitutional matter. <em>Id. </em>at 736 (discussing <em>Woods v.

This is no less true for claims of alleged trial court error — and particularly where discretionary decisions, such as the admission or exclusion of evidence, which often depend upon trial context, are involved. <em>See Commonwealth v.

When a claim has not been raised in the trial court there is often a scant or insufficient record for appellate review. “Where parties below were not aware that a particular issue was being raised, it was quite likely that testimony germane to that issue would be overlooked or believed to be unnecessary and consequently not presented.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The record will be devoid of relevant, contemporaneous arguments from the trial attorneys, who were in the best position to advocate the merits of the matter when it arose — particularly with respect to the harmfulness or curability of an objectionable event, a matter which appears in a very different light before a verdict has been returned. After-the-fact reconstructions, non-record sources, and averments in appellate briefs are distinctly inferior to review of record objections, arguments, and remedial requests actually and timely forwarded and decided by the trial court.</p>

Belated appellate challenges to matters such as the prosecutor’s alleged misconduct — four such claims are raised by appellant here — likewise require the Court to speculate as to the reasons for a challenged question, argument or course of conduct. For example, if an objection to an allegedly improper question is timely raised, the prosecutor can be directed to state the legal ground or basis for the question on the record and the judge can then rule.

The doctrine obliges this Court to view many claims in an academic, artificial, or misleading fashion. For example, this Court is often asked to determine trial court error when, in point of fact, the trial court was not asked to act and thus cannot accurately or fairly be said to have made an “error.” The potential for misleading review is particularly acute in instances where we examine a waived claim of “trial court error” premised upon a case or rule of constitutional law which was not even in existence at the time of trial. In such an instance, the relaxed waiver rule operates to permit an entirely new rule of law to apply retroactively to a matter in which the issue was not properly raised and preserved below. For example, the United States Supreme Court has- held that the rule set forth in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em><a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">476 U.S. 79</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">106 S.Ct. 1712</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">90 L.Ed.2d 69</a> (1986), applies retroactively to matters pending on direct appeal at the time the case was decided. <em>Griffith v.

Claims of alleged trial court “error” should not be evaluated in light of standards that did not apply at the time of trial, standards that the defendant did not urge the trial court to adopt, and which the trial court could not possibly have anticipated. As a matter of principle, it is more accurate and realistic to view claims in light of what actually happened at trial, and under the law that actually applied. Belated or collateral attacks upon what happened at trial are better suited for consideration under a different rubric, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, where the proper focus is on the reasons counsel failed to raise an issue which was never brought to the trial judge’s attention at a time when remedial measures might have been undertaken.</p>

In Justice Nix’s view, the real question “reaches the propriety of this Court’s acquiescence in an obvious excess of sentencing power of one of its inferior tribunals.” <em>Id. </em>That issue was resolved by this Court’s supervisory power and obligation: ‘‘Where there is an absence of sentencing power ..., this Court’s supervisory power requires that it provide a remedy, even if <em>sua sponte </em>consideration is necessary to effectuate that relief.” <em>Id. </em>at 182 n. 5. <em>See also id. </em>at 183 (“In my judgment it would be repugnant to any fair system of jurisprudence to knowingly permit a court to impose a sanction (regardless of its nature) that exceeds that tribunal’s authority”).

These protections, not available in other criminal matters, serve a function similar to the relaxed waiver rale. First, this Court performs a self-imposed duty to review the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the first-degree murder conviction in all capital direct appeals, regardless of whether the appellant has raised the issue. <em>See Zettlemoyer, </em><a href="/citations/?q=454%20A.2d%20987" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="454 A.2d 987">454 A.2d at </a>942 n. 3.

This mandated review of the sentence is similar to the review this Court employed <em>sua sponte </em>in <em>McKenna. </em>In addition to these special protections afforded capital appellants, the PCRA exists for them, as for other criminal defendants, as a vehicle for a full and fair, counseled proceeding through which they may challenge the stewardship of trial counsel and pursue other appropriate collateral claims.</p>

It will then apply to all future capital appeals. In declining to apply the new approach to pending cases already briefed or in the process of being briefed, we emphasize the different posture of these cases <em>vis a vis </em>Grant, where this Court held that the new rule would apply to other cases on direct appeal where the issue of ineffectiveness was properly raised and preserved. The <em>Grant </em>rule simply deferred consideration of claims of counsel ineffectiveness to the more appropriate vehicle provided by PCRA review. Here, in contrast, the waived claims of trial error that will no longer be reached via the relaxed waiver rule are not simply being deferred to PCRA review. Instead, those waived claims would be available on PCRA review only as distinct claims of counsel ineffectiveness or under some other theory. Prospective application of our new approach will avoid upsetting the expectations of capital appellants and their direct appeal counsel who have already briefed, or are in the process .of briefing, their appeals in reliance upon the prospect that this Court, in its discretion, might reach the merits of some of their otherwise waived claims of trial error.

The record reflects that the prosecutor asked appellant to explain his claim on direct examination that the shootings were an accident. Appellant responded that when he approached the victims’ car he had no intention of shooting anyone. He further testified that he asked Mamie Shamsid-Din to exit the car and pointed his gun into the car. According to appellant, Dalton Johnson grabbed the gun, but appellant was able to pull it back at which point it simply “went off.” The prosecutor then asked appellant how many times the gun “went off,” and appellant replied that he did not remember. At that point, with the trial court’s permission, the prosecutor approached appellant and attempted to show him the crime scene photographs so that appellant could “see what [he] did that day.” Appellant refused and the trial court ruled that he did not have to view the pictures.

Rather, the prosecutor sought to rebut appellant’s claim that he was “sorry” about the killings by eliciting testimony that he had, in fact, fled the jurisdiction following the murders and would have continued to avoid law enforcement had his sister-in-law not informed the police of his whereabouts — circumstances that reflect an unwillingness to take responsibility for his actions.

While reference to irrelevant matters should be avoided, we note that murder victims are not simply props or irrelevancies in a murder prosecution, and innocuous references to victims and their families are not necessarily prejudicial. In this case, the prosecution did not refer to the victims or the impact of their deaths on their families as an independent reason, outside of the statutory factors the jury was charged to consider, why the jury should return verdicts of death. Indeed, the prosecutor’s first reference to the victims’ families was part of an innocuous introductory statement acknowledging the presence of the various people in the courtroom that day. It cannot seriously be maintained that any prejudice followed from this passing reference. The second reference was primarily a comment on the evidence properly admitted at trial concerning appellant’s flight from the jurisdiction following the murders and the many years that passed before his eventual apprehension.

Appellant also alleges trial court error resulting from instances of uncorrected misconduct by the prosecutor involving: (1) repeatedly calling the killings "executions;” (2) asking appellant during the penalty phase whether he had previously told his account to anyone in law enforcement; (3) repeatedly demanding that appellant look at inflammatory photographs; and (4) employing improper victim-impact testimony and argument.

To the contrary, I believe that all of the referenced statements were weighty points directed to securing, and militating in favor of, the imposition of the penalty of death.
