No less than fifteen fact and expert witnesses testified. Father’s evidence focused generally on his allegation that Mother was unfit to be the primary custodian of the children. He alleged that Mother was unstable and the children lacked adequate care. The Master issued a lengthy and detailed report and recommended that Mother retain her primary custodial role, that the parties share legal custody and that Father be granted additional periods of custody. The Master set forth the following custody plan. During the school year, Mother was to have primary custody of the children and Father was to have custody every Thursday evening and on alternate weekends (Friday evening through Sunday evening). During the summer, the terms were reversed and Father had primary custody with Mother granted Thursday evenings and alternate weekends. Holidays and family vacations were split relatively evenly.</p>

Father did not request a hearing again until four months later on August 9, 2002, when he once more sought a <em>de novo </em>hearing. This time, he asserted to the court that Mother intended to move from Honesdale to Peckville, in adjacent Lackawanna County. Father asked for a prompt hearing.</p>

In setting the date, the court noted the importance of reaching a decision prior to the commencement of the school year. In light of that concern, the court limited each party to one hour of testimony. The court also limited Father to three witnesses, limited Mother to her own testimony and revealed its intention to interview the children <em>in camera. </em>Father lodged no objections to this order.</p>

    <p id="b1320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1320.5",1320,[220,403,751,661]]]'>¶ 19 Father claims that the move to a new school would be too difficult for the children and in this regard we note several things. First, the trial court discussed the prospect of changing schools during <em>in camera </em>interviews with both children. Neither child opposed the change. Second, because Father himself moved recently, the children would have had to change schools anyway if Father were granted the custody he sought.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The court noted this fact on the record. Custody Hearing, 8/19/02, at 10.</p>
    <p id="b1320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1320.6",1320,[218,1093,752,403]]]'>¶ 20 Regarding the parties’ motives, the second prong of <em>Gruber, </em>the court concluded that both parents were sincere in their motives. The court arrived at this conclusion despite the record showing of hostility and animosity between the parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We will not disturb the court’s credibility findings.</p>

The move has little impact on the custody arrangement. At most, Father argued that the longer drive time between homes would adversely .affect his Thursday evening custody privileges. But neither party offered the precise amount of additional driving time Mother’s move would cause; the only concrete evidence offered was by Mother who testified that her new residence was about thirty to forty minutes away. We imagine that prior to Mother’s move, Father would have to have had <em>some </em>period of driving time, particularly after he moved from Honesdale on his own accord. It does not appear from the record that the increase in driving time would cause a substantial change in the custody plan such that “realistic, substitute visitation arrangements” were required. <em>Gruber, supra, </em>at 439.</p>
    <p id="b1320-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1320.12",1320,[1019,877,753,871]]]'>¶ 22 Father began this case in 1998 in an attempt to gain primary custody from Mother. There was no relocation issue at that time. Multiple hearings before the Master focused on Father’s allegations that Mother was not a fit parent and custody with Father was in the children’s best interests. A subsequent Master’s report detailed why Father failed to establish these facts. When Father did not succeed, he requested review in the trial court but then sought and received an open continuance. After a period of no activity, Father raised new allegations of abuse on Mother’s part<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and challenged her right to move some thirty minutes away. Meanwhile, he moved to another town.</p>

The evidence of record supports the court’s ultimate conclusion that Mother should retain primary custody throughout the school year and Father should continue to have primary custody throughout the summer. In both <a id="p1273" href="#p1273" data-label="1273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1273</a>instances, frequent and extended visitation for the non-custodial parent is provided. The trial court insured that Mother’s proposed move satisfied the <em>Gruber </em>standard, even though the move itself brought about little, if any, change to the custody provisions in place.</p>

    <p id="b1321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1321.6",1321,[105,787,753,447]]]'>¶ 24 We hold that in cases involving intra-state relocation, the determination of whether to use a <em>Gruber </em>analysis should be left to the discretion of the trial court. In the case before us, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in continuing the custody order and permitting Mother to move. Both decisions were in the children’s best interests.</p>

Father initially claims that because Mother did not file a Petition for Relocation, the matter was not “officially of record.” We note that in the petition he filed on August 9, 2002, Father informed the court of Mother’s plans to move and specifically requested that the court promptly schedule a hearing so that the issue could be resolved. We conclude the matter was "officially of record” here.</p>
