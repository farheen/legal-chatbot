This presents a somewhat different situation but not one so different, in our view, as to call for a different result. The board treats the two cases alike and pursued a rule which it derives from two of our earlier decisions, <em>In re </em>Zickendraht, <a href="/ccpa/50-2/1529-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="50 C.C.P.A. 1529" data-case-ids="6082798" data-case-paths="/ccpa/50-2/1529-01">50 CCPA 1529</a>, <a href="/f2d/319/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="319 F.2d 225" data-case-ids="157955,6082798" data-case-paths="/f2d/319/0225-01,/ccpa/50-2/1529-01">319 F. 2d 225</a>, <a href="/ccpa/50-2/1529-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="50 C.C.P.A. 1529" data-case-ids="6082798" data-case-paths="/ccpa/50-2/1529-01">138 USPQ 22</a> (1963), and <em>In re Ockert, </em><a href="/ccpa/44-2/1024-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="44 C.C.P.A. 1024" data-case-ids="6080435" data-case-paths="/ccpa/44-2/1024-01">44 CCPA 1024</a>, <a href="/f2d/245/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="245 F.2d 467" data-case-ids="404155,6080435" data-case-paths="/f2d/245/0467-01,/ccpa/44-2/1024-01">245 F. 2d 467</a>, <a href="/ccpa/44-2/1024-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="44 C.C.P.A. 1024" data-case-ids="6080435" data-case-paths="/ccpa/44-2/1024-01">114 USPQ 330</a> (1957). This rule it describes as “The well established doctrine that claims in a second application must define a patentably distinct invention over the. claims of an appellant’s prior patent * * <em>* </em>regardless of the comparative scope of the claims or of the order in which the claims were presented.” In neither of these cases was there any consideration of a terminal disclaimer since in neither case was one filed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <em>Oehert </em>was essentially a single invention type of situation like <em>Siu, </em>and <em>Ziehen-draht </em>was at the very beginning of the period of our recent rethinking of the double patenting situation. In fact it was in footnote 4 of the concurring opinion of the writer therein that the suggestion was made which appears to have resulted in increasing use of the terminal disclaimer to avoid double patenting. -In the present case the board has accepted as effective such a disclaimer apparently where it has found the patent and application claims to be mutually exclusive, as illustrated by comparing patent claim 1 to making <em>olhyl </em>lead compounds with allowed application claim 4 to making <em>-phenyl </em>lead compounds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Alkyl, of course, does not include phenyl. The board has drawn the line to exclude new claims which would dominate the patent claims.</p>

Claims such as claim 1 herein, drawn broadly enough to cover the numerous metals dealt with in this application, are also broad enough to cover the alkyl lead of the patent and so dominate claims of the patent as stated.</p>
