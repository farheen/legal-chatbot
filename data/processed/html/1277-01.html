The Request also asks that the Board “grant 2.5 multiplier.” This is a reference to the fact that the Retirement Code provides that a member of the retirement system shall be entitled to receive “[a] standard single life annuity multiplied by the class of service multiplier and calculated on the basis of the number of years of credited school service ...” 24 Pa.C.S. § 8342(a)(1). Pursuant to 24 Pa.C.S. 8102 (Definitions), the definition of a standard single life annuity is: “... for Class T-D credited service of a member, an annuity equal to 2.5% of the final average salary, multiplied by the total number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service.” Conversely, for class T-C membership, which is Petitioner’s current membership status in the retirement system, the multiplier is only 2%.

In its preliminary objections, PSERS asserted that Petitioner’s Request is legally insufficient because it mailed Petitioner an Act 2001-9 Membership Class Election Form on June 6, 2001 and, on November 9, 2001, it notified Petitioner’s employer school district that Petitioner had not yet elected Class T-D membership. PSERS also asserted that there is no indication in Petitioner’s file that any of this correspondence was ever returned due to an incorrect address. Accordingly, because Claimant failed to elect Class T-D membership before the <a id="p1280" href="#p1280" data-label="1280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1280</a>statutory deadline, PSERS requested that Petitioner’s Request be dismissed. Petitioner filed a brief with the Board asserting that nothing outside of the complaint is to be considered when disposing of questions of law raised by a demurrer to the complaint and that “[a] comparison of [Petitioner’s] Request for Administrative Hearing with PSERS’s Preliminary Objections clearly reveals that almost every fact-based paragraph of PSERS’ Preliminary Objections is based on evidence outside of [Petitioner’s] Request for Administrative Hearing.” (R.R. at 12a).</p>

The Board stated that there are no disputed material facts at issue and that Petitioner admits that he did not file an election form on or before December 31, 2001. The Board also stated that it is authorized to take official notice of the files maintained by PSERS. The Board examined those files, which revealed that, on May 18, 2001, PSERS sent a letter by first-class mail to Petitioner’s home address informing him of the provisions of Act 9 of 2001. The files also indicated that PSERS mailed Petitioner an Act 2001-9 Membership Class Election Form on June 6, 2001 and, on November 9, 2001, PSERS notified Claimant’s employer school district that Petitioner had not yet elected Class T-D membership. Accordingly, the Board found that “although not required here, notice sent by first class mail is deemed sufficient notice under the law.” The Board also found that, because Petitioner never filed the Class T-D Class election form before the statutory deadline, he is ineligible to elect Class T-D membership. Accordingly, the Board sustained PSERS’ Preliminary Objections and dismissed Petitioner’s Request. This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Because the employee was never provided with this proper notice, we reversed the order of the Board and ordered that the employee be granted multiple service membership in the retirement system. <em>See also Tyson v. Pennsylvania Public School Employes’ Retirement System, </em><a href="/a2d/737/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="737 A.2d 325" data-case-ids="11568948" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0325-01">737 A.2d 325</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1999), <em>petition for allowance of appeal denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=563%20Pa.%20624" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="563 Pa. 624">563 Pa. 624</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%20937" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="757 A.2d 937">757 A.2d 937</a> (request for multiple service properly denied because PSERS did provide employee with sufficient notice within 30 days).

The employee cited <em>Higgins </em>for the proposition that PSERS was required to provide her with notice by first class mail. In rejecting the employee’s argument, we held that:</p>
    <blockquote id="ACM" data-blocks='[["BL_1319.4",1319,[182,1982,715,709]],["BL_1319.5",1319,[978,284,717,1435]]]'>we agree with the Board that <em>Higgins </em>is distinguishable from the situation in Strawn’s case. <em>Higgins </em>involved a specific provision of the Retirement Code, 24 Pa.C.S. § 8506(g), which expressly requires that PSERS notify former SERS members of their right to elect multiple service membership upon gaining PSERS membership through public school employment. This Court concluded in <em>Higgins </em>that bulk mailings were not sufficient to comply with this specific statutory requirement to notify members of their right to elect multiple service. The Retirement Code does not contain an equivalent provision requiring that PSERS specifically notify its members of the two-year restriction on their inactive member status as set forth in 24 Pa.C.S. § 8102. If Strawn’s approach were followed to its logical conclusion PSERS would be required to provide separate written notice regarding each provision in the Retirement Code that could have an impact on a member’s benefits. If the General Assembly had intended to require specific notice of all Retirement Code provisions impacting a member’s benefits it easily could have done so. <em>See </em>Section 1921 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921. It is not for the courts to add, by interpretation, to a statute, a requirement which the General Assembly did not see fit to include. <em>Hanna v.

Therefore, based on our reasoning in <em>Trakes, </em>the <em>Higgins </em>case does not <em>require </em>that PSERS provide notice by first class mail to its members informing them of their option to elect to become a Class TD members of the retirement system. However, one salient fact does distinguish this case from <em>Trakes: </em>In this case, PSERS <em>elected </em>to provide notice by first class mail to all its members of their option to become Class T-D members. If we <a id="p1282" href="#p1282" data-label="1282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1282</a>would take PSERS’ argument that the notice issue is irrelevant to its logical conclusion, it could willingly provide notice of important retirement benefits to certain members and not others and the members who did not receive notice would have absolutely no recourse. This result is untenable. Accordingly, we hold that in this situation, basic principles of fairness dictate that if PSERS chooses to provide notice of retirement benefits despite not being statutorily mandated to do so, it must provide the same notice to <em>all </em>its members.</p>
    <p id="b1320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1320.4",1320,[195,1039,755,764]]]'>Having determined that PSERS was required to provide Petitioner the same notice it admits it provided to all its members, we now address Petitioner’s remaining argument. It is well-settled that in Pennsylvania civil practice, preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer require the court to resolve the issues solely on the basis of the pleadings. Thus, no testimony or other evidence outside of the complaint may be considered to dispose of the legal issues presented by a demurrer. <em>P.J.S. v. Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission, </em><a href="/a2d/669/1105-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="669 A.2d 1105" data-case-ids="11339696" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/1105-01">669 A.2d 1105</a>, 1112 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996).</p>

R.C.P. No. 1028.” Thus, the Board would likewise not be permitted to consider evidence or facts alleged outside of Petitioner’s Request in ruling on PSERS’ preliminary objections, which it did when it took “official notice” of the information in Petitioner’s file. Moreover, by taking “official notice” of these records, the Board stopped these records from being admitted into evidence at a hearing, thus making it impossible for this Court to review the Board’s decision and determine whether Petitioner did in fact receive notice by first class mail at the correct address. As Petitioner correctly points out in his brief, the Board stated that Petitioner’s file reveals that he was provided with notice by first class mail at his home address. However, the Board does not reveal what address PSERS has listed as Petitioner’s home address. Thus, it is still uncertain as to whether PSERS sent this notice to the correct address. Petitioner alleges that PSERS did not send the notice to the correct address and this is the reason why he filed the Request. This is an important fact that must be determined and that Petitioner must be allowed to challenge at a hearing. If not allowed to elect Class T-D membership, Petitioner stands to lose a significant amount of retirement benefits. The Board should reveal what evidence PSERS has in its files regarding the notice it asserts it provided to Petitioner before denying him these significant retirement benefits. Again, basic principles of fairness require this result. Therefore, we conclude that the Board erred by taking “official notice” of PSERS’ files and using information taken from those files to support its decision to grant PSERS’ preliminary objections.</p>

Petitioner also argues that the Board erred by using the legal standard used to dispose of a summary judgment motion pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20201.3" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="22 Pa. Code § 201.3">22 Pa. Code § 201.3</a>(b) rather than the legal standard used to dispose of preliminary objections pursuant to 22 Pa.Code § 201.3(a). <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20201.3" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="22 Pa. Code § 201.3">22 Pa. Code § 201.3</a>(b) provides that: "The System or the claimant may file a motion for summary judgment directly with the Board. The motion shall conform to Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 1035.1-1035.4.” Because neither Petitioner nor PSERS filed a motion for summary judgment, the Board also erred by dismissing Petitioner’s request on this basis.</p>
