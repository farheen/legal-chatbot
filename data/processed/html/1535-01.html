In 1993, the legislature amended Chapter 599B, Nevada Revised Statutes, entitled “Solicitation by Telephone,” to require telephone solicitors to register their business with the State, pay an annual fee of $6,000, and post a $50,000 bond. The Attorney General informed Erwin that the statute applied to his business practices. Erwin sought equitable relief and filed a complaint, claiming that Chapter 599B did not apply to his business and that its application violated his constitutional rights. The State filed a countermotion to dismiss. After a hearing, the district court dismissed Erwin’s complaint and granted the State’s countermotion.</p>

In any event, we note that this court does not need to look to the legislative history to discover the meaning of Chapter 599B because the plain language of the statute covers Erwin’s conduct. “ ‘Where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, and its meaning clear and unmistakable, there is no room for construction, and the courts are not <a id="p1539" href="#p1539" data-label="1539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1539</a>permitted to search for its meaning beyond the statute itself.’” Charlie Brown Constr.

    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[360,374,1122,451]]]'>We hold that Chapter 599B is a reasonable regulation of the sale of sports information comporting with constitutional requirements. Chapter 599B regulates trade and attempts to protect consumers against fraudulent practices by regulating persons who sell products and services via telephone. The legislature’s intent to protect the public from the harmful sale of certain products and services via telephone articulates a substantial state interest. More importantly, the legislative history of Chapter 599B reflects that the legislature particularly considered the real harms presented by the telephonic sale of sports information.</p>
    <p id="b648-6" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[357,829,1122,358]]]'>Regulation of the telephonic sale of sports information is especially critical given the State’s interest in protecting the gaming industry from deceptive trade practices and fraud. A sports information service may intentionally or negligently provide inaccurate information about a sporting event that a subscriber could detrimentally rely on in betting. Additionally, a service may be involved in illegal betting, a legislative concern pointed out in the history of the chapter.</p>

    <p id="b648-8" data-blocks='[["BL_648.7",648,[355,1506,1124,453]]]'>If left unregulated, sports information services like Erwin’s could cause consumers to lose money because of misrepresentations made during the sale presentation or delivery of the sports information. Erwin’s particular practice of requiring consumers to pay in advance for sports information for an entire season presents significant concerns for consumer protection. Like other future contracts, the consumer could incur a financial loss if Erwin goes out of business or fails to deliver the promised services. Accordingly, the posting of a security bond by Erwin protects consumers from this potential harm.</p>
    <p id="b648-9" data-blocks='[["BL_648.8",648,[354,1961,1122,302]]]'>The rules of practice enumerated in the chapter also advance the public interest in consumer protection. Under NRS 599B.090, the seller must provide the Consumer Affairs Division with background information about the business and the people operating it. This information is helpful should the State need to investigate into the business practices of a sports information seller.</p>

Sellers must adhere to a minimum refund policy contained in NRS 599B.190 and send each subscriber a form after each phone call involving a delivery of service. All of these provisions materially advance the goal of protecting the consumers of telephone sports information in a minimally intrusive manner.</p>
    <p id="b649-3" data-blocks='[["BL_649.4",649,[119,618,1125,455]]]'>Erwin appears to argue that he should not be regulated since he does not engage in deceptive trade practices. If that contention were the touchstone of our analysis it would decimate the law of trade regulation and consumer protection. By design, this area of law is prophylactic in nature so that the State can protect the marketplace and consumers from abuses. In sum, the inclusion of sports information services such as Erwin’s in Chapter 599B materially advances, is rationally related to, and is narrowly drawn to achieve the substantial public interest in regulating trade practices and protecting consumers.</p>

We disagree. To avoid a vagueness challenge, a statute must provide to a person of ordinary intelligence adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited and sufficient guidelines to preclude arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement <a id="p1544" href="#p1544" data-label="1544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1544</a>of the statute.

We hold that Chapter 599B, as amended in 1993, provides adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The statute clearly and specifically defines who is a “seller” subject to regulation by the State, outlines what conduct the statute regulates, and explains how each seller must register in order to comply with the regulation. Chapter 599B places a person of ordinary intelligence on notice that one must register with the State before engaging in these business practices. Erwin advertises his service on a regular basis in two publications and he solicits persons who call his business in response to his advertisement. Chapter 599B puts Erwin on notice that he is subject to its regulation and, therefore, does not violate his due process rights.</p>

[t]hat offered for sale is information or opinions relating to sporting events.” Erwin denies that he ever initiates contact by telephone, and the State has not presented any evidence that would contradict Erwin’s contention. Regardless of whether Erwin falls under both subsections, he clearly falls under 599.010(8)(c)(2), as we hold here. This is sufficient to include him in the regulatory scheme of Chapter 599B.</p>
