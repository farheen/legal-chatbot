In the summer of 1991, after appellee rebuffed her attempt to reconcile, appellant informed appellee of her desire to move to California so as to be closer to her family and improve her quality of life. Father opposed relocation and, in July, 1991, obtained a restraining Order prohibiting the move. After a hearing during which the court entertained testimony from both parties, their respective families and the court-appointed psychologist Dr. Stephen Seha-ehner, the court denied mother’s petition and directed, inter aha, should mother relocate, temporary custody would be granted to father pending resolution of his suit for primary custody. The Order also directed both parties to obtain counseling for parenting skills and appellee to seek counseling for substance abuse.</p>

The court, however, refused to allow the testimony reasoning a parent’s ability to care for a child must be determined at the time of the hearing, in this case December, 1993, and a parent’s prior negative behavior should be considered only if there is an on-going negative effect on the child. <em>See Hall v.

We agree with the trial court and find appellant has failed to meet her burden of establishing the proffered testimony was relevant to the issue at hand. The trial court properly stated the petition before it was one requesting relocation, and not one addressing support. Moreover, we note, nowhere in the record is there a copy of the support Order or documentation from the family division support section of the monthly amount paid or the accumulation of alleged arrearages. Further, we view this allegation with suspicion, in light of ap-pellee’s alleged arrearages, since no contempt Order had been sought. Because there is no support for appellant’s argument father flouted the legal system by being delinquent in his support payments, appellant’s boilerplate charge, premised on <em>Bresnock, supra, </em>does not permit the unsubstantiated allegation to be admissible as evidence. Also, contrary to appellant’s present averment her move was financially motivated in an effort to secure otherwise unavailable free day-care, necessitated by father’s failure to remain current in support, appellant readily admitted gratis day-care by Brandon’s paternal extended family existed from the time the child was an infant. Finally, the court noted appellant, who holds a 1989 business/psychology degree from the University of Pittsburgh, made the economic decision not to attempt to secure local employment in her field, but rather to leave an assistant manager position with Firestone in order to waitress six days a week at a local restaurant. It is arguable any financial duress endured by appellant is self-imposed. The court’s decision to disallow testimony regarding alleged support arrearages was proper.</p>

This argument is part and parcel of appellant’s general contention the court’s decision to deny mother’s request for relocation was not in Brandon’s best interests.</p>

It was Schachner’s opinion appellant had not carefully thought-out or planned her move to California, and had too little concern for the disruptive effect the move would have on Brandon’s young life, a large portion of which had been spent in the care of appellee and his extended family. Schachner believed although it would be beneficial for Brandon to spend time with appellant’s family in California, those benefits would be outweighed by then 8^ year old Brandon’s angst regarding abandonment and loss of contact with appellee.

The court noted mother had not secured employment in California and had failed to aggressively pursue employment commensurate with her education in the Pittsburgh area. As to appel-lee’s relationship with Brandon, Schachner found, as did the trial court, father and son enjoyed “a meaningful relationship that would suffer greatly” should mother relocate. (Slip Op., Baldwin, J., 4/21/94, p. 9.) Brandon’s positive, on-going relationship with father’s parents, grandparents and sister, as well as his relationship with his maternal grandmother, aunt and uncle, each of whom, since 1989, have resided in California, weighed in the court’s decision but were not paramount. Father’s motive in opposing relocation was not found to be retaliatory or spiteful. To the contrary, the record established father’s objection to the move stemmed from his concern for Brandon and their relationship. Based on our review of the record, we find the trial court neither abused its discretion nor committed an error of law by deciding it was in Brandon’s best <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>interests to refuse mother’s request to relocate.</p>
