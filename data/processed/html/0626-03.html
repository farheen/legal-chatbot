A second municipality, Nar-berth Borough (Narberth), whose border abutted the land to be developed, opposed the project. The Township provisionally approved the first step in the development process. It communicated this decision first by announcing it in an open hearing, and then by mailing a formal written decision. The Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 P.S. §§ 10101, <em>et seq.,</em>

Narberth appealed within thirty days of Township’s written decision, but more than thirty days after the earlier verbal announcement. Merloc moved to dismiss Narberth’s appeal as untimely, arguing that Narberth had failed to file the appeal within thirty days of the verbal announcement. The trial court denied that motion, but, on appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed. Accordingly, we granted <em>allocatur </em>to decide whether the applicable thirty-day appeal period runs from the verbal announcement of a municipality’s decision or the subsequent written communication formalizing that decision. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Commonwealth Court, concluding that the appeal period runs from the mailing of the written decision.</p>

Nar-berth’s Solicitor immediately noted Nar-berth’s opposition to the decision and its intention to file a land use appeal.

Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Nar-berth’s Notice of Appeal filed on April 26, 2002, was untimely because more than thirty days had passed since the Board announced its decision at the March 20, 2002, meeting. Thus, the Commonwealth Court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal on the merits, effectively reinstating the Board’s approval of Merloc’s tentative sketch plan.

Thus, the preliminary plan application “was premised upon a valid tentative sketch plan approval,” Reply Brief for Appellant at 19, and ostensibly is invalid to the extent the tentative sketch plan was, as found by the trial court, missing mandatory documentation.

Specifically, § 1S5-16B(16) of the Code requires submission, with a tentative sketch plan, of a conservation plan inventory satisfying the requirements of Code § 101-14A. The preliminary plan requirements, on the other hand, make no mention of § 101-14A. Certain mandatory submissions with a tentative sketch plan do not correlate with any comparable requirement of the preliminary plan. <em>See, e.g., </em>§§ 101 — 14A(3)(e) (requiring information pertaining to wetlands); 101-14A(4) (requiring information pertaining existing wildlife habitat).</p>

Based chiefly on the plain language of MPC § 1002-A and 42 Pa.C.S. § 5572, Narberth contends that “all appeals from land use decisions,” whether by an applicant or an objector, are timely if filed within thirty days of “the date of mailing” of the decision. The parties do not dispute that Narberth filed its Notice of Appeal within thirty days of the Township’s mailing of its March 28, 2002 written decision-in this case, both to Merloc and to Narberth, although it was required by statute to serve that decision only upon Merloc. Thus, on Narberth’s account of the relevant timing provisions, Narberth’s appeal was timely.</p>

Thus, we next must determine what the statute reveals about the legislature’s intended meaning for that phrase. MPC 1002-A and 508(1) furnish the answer. While, speaking generally, § 508(1) could be clearer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> it unequivocally requires that a “decision” for purposes of this case <em>“shall be in writing and shall be communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him </em>at his last known address not later than 15 days following the decision.” 53 P.S. § 10508(l)(emphasis added). By its terms, then, § 508 requires reduction of the Board’s disposition to a writing that is mailed, handed, emailed, faxed, or otherwise transmitted in written form to the applicant.

Because the statute is clear for purposes of the instant case, to read the statute as providing different triggering dates for the respective appeal periods for applicants and objectors, as the Commonwealth Court did, is tantamount to rewriting the statute, disregarding the statutory language under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. To do so would violate one of our principal mandates in statutory interpretation. <em>Cf. 1 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1921(b)(‘When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”).</p>

Thus, neither of the two conditions precedent in § 1002-A had been satisfied, and the language of the relevant provisions offered little guidance to the court in resolving the dispute it faced. In <em>lieu </em>of textual direction, the <em>Peterson </em>court, forced to infer legislative intent by the inadequacy of the statutory scheme to the peculiar situation it faced, speculated “that the [legislative] intent of Section 1002-A was to begin [the thirty-day appeal period] when the municipality’s decision process has been finalized with sufficient clarity that any party aggrieved by the decision can evaluate whether or not to appeal.” <a href="/a2d/804/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="804 A.2d 723" data-case-ids="11421728" data-case-paths="/a2d/804/0723-01">804 A.2d at 728</a>.

Echoing the points pressed by Merloc in the instant case, the Commonwealth Court observed that these limitations might present an objector with a degree of uncertainty the legislature could not have intended. Thus, it concluded, in effect, that the plain language of the statute was inadequate to the task of governing land use appeals generally-a determination the posture of that case allowed because the plain language failed to reveal an unequivocal legislative intent. Without criticizing the <em>Peterson </em>court for its approach under the difficult facts of that case, we nevertheless find it unpersuasive under the present circumstances, in which we face a situation to which the statute is directly responsive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a>

MPC § 508 arguably uses "decision” in two distinct ways, treating it both as the act of decision (the approval at the time the Board determines to do so) and the creation and transmission of same. Be that as it may, § 508 clearly anticipates the "communication” of a writing to the applicant as a necessary occurrence, 53 P.S. § 10508(1), and provides for deemed approval in the event that such "communication” does not occur, without regard to whether the decision-making authority announces its disposition at a public meeting.

Thus, any such ambiguity does not affect the inquiry at hand.</p>

We will not speculate as to the disposition of a case where a decision is "entered” by mailing to an applicant, and an objector subsequently argues that it neither knew nor could have known of that mailing.
