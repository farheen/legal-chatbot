Under the supervision and direction of Officer Iezzi, a confidential informant known as “Pockets” placed several phone calls to [Willis] between January 11 and March 22, 2006.

Prior to 1972, when the new Crimes Code was enacted, the law employed a “subjective” test to determine whether a defendant had been entrapped. The focus was on the defendant’s predisposition to committing the crime, rather than the conduct of law enforcement. <em>Commonwealth v. Jensch, </em><a href="/pa-super/348/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="348 Pa.

As such, the burden fell on the Commonwealth to disprove entrapment (or lack of intent) beyond a reasonable doubt. <em><a href="/pa-super/348/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="348 Pa. Super. 142" data-case-ids="645170" data-case-paths="/pa-super/348/0142-01">Id.</a> </em>However, upon the enactment of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 313 as part of the 1972 Crimes Code, the burden, along with the nature of the test to determine entrapment, shifted. <em><a href="/pa-super/348/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="348 Pa. Super. 142" data-case-ids="645170" data-case-paths="/pa-super/348/0142-01">Id.</a> </em>The focus of the fact-finder’s inquiry became the conduct of the police and the burden shifted to defendants to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they had been entrapped. <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa-super/242/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="242 Pa.

    <p id="b818-4" data-blocks='[["BL_818.5",818,[197,599,753,1383]]]'>¶ 10 In this case, the crux of Willis’ defense is the alleged conduct of Howard “Wing Ding” Jones, a lifelong friend of Willis’ who was, at the time, in federal custody and attempting to secure leniency by providing information to the authorities. According to Willis, “Wing Ding” repeatedly pressured him to engage in the sale of illegal narcotics to another informant named “Pockets.” Willis testified that “Wing Ding” called him from prison 25 to 30 times between January 11 and March 22, 2006. N.T., 7/9/08, at 147. Willis testified that he only acceded to his old friend’s request because he believed “Wing Ding” was prone to violence, even from behind prison walls, and thus feared for the safety of his wife and family if he did not cooperate. N.T., 7/9/08, at 143-44. Willis argues that “Wing Ding” engaged in this harassing behavior in his capacity as a government informant; that the authorities knew or should have known about the allegedly harassing phone calls, yet did nothing to stop them; and, as a result, the conduct must be attributed to the government.</p>

Officer Ferdman testified that he was in the room at the time “Wing Ding” made his proffer to the federal authorities. N.T., 7/8/08, at 34-36. He stated that ‘Wing Ding” called Willis at the behest of the authorities to set in motion the transaction between Willis and “Pockets.” <em><a href="/pa-super/252/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="252 Pa.

The standard jury instructions do not contain a specific instruction regarding the responsibility of law enforcement for actions of cooperators taken independent of the direction or control of authorities. <em>See </em>Pa. SSJI § 8.313. Accordingly, the trial court crafted its own instruction reflecting its understanding of the applicable law, namely <em>Lindenmuth </em>and <em>Manley, <a href="/pa-super/252/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="252 Pa.
