    <p id="b513-7" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[152,1264,756,1176]]]'>The record reveals that the Houghton Mifflin Company (“HM” or “the Company<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>’) employed Mr. Weekes during 2001 and 2002 as an assistant general counsel. His duties included reviewing vendor requests for payment and authorizing payments to vendors and third parties. The stipulation of Massachusetts Bar Counsel and Mr. Weekes, filed in the Massachusetts disciplinary proceeding, specified that “[i]n May 2001, July 2001, and October 2001, [Mr. Weekes] intentionally and fraudulently caused three [HM] checks to-talling $22,701 to be written to ‘Equity R.P.’” Equity R.P. stood for “Equity Real Protection,” purportedly a security company that provided service on behalf of HM. However, that company did not exist. Mr. Weekes actually gave the checks to the manager of his apartment building, “Equity Residential Property Management,” to cover his residential rental payments.</p>
    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[152,2473,751,196]],["BL_513.8",513,[957,257,751,293]]]'>The stipulation also indicated that in May 2002, Mr. Weekes “intentionally and fraudulently caused a [HM] check for $3,400 to be issued to Attorney Robert D. Keough,” supposedly for legal fees pertaining to Mr. Keough’s alleged representation of HM in an employment discrimination case. Instead, the check covered Mr. Weekes’s share of rent for a Rhode Island summer vacation home.</p>
    <p id="b513-10" data-blocks='[["BL_513.9",513,[956,585,754,1084]]]'>When we temporarily suspended Mr. Weekes in 2005, pending the final outcome of the Massachusetts disciplinary proceeding, we informed Mr. Weekes of the requirement that he submit an affidavit in compliance with D.C. Bar R. XI, § 14(g). The Board submitted a Report, dated January 20, 2006, noting that the October 19, 2005 affidavit submitted by Mr. Weekes did not comply with the applicable rule. The Board therefore recommended that “any period of suspension that ultimately may be imposed by [this court] as reciprocal discipline would run from the date Respondent files the affidavit required by D.C. Bar R. XI, § 14(g).” More than two years after the Board’s 2006 Report, and following other communications advising Mr. Weekes that he had not submitted an acceptable affidavit, he filed an affidavit complying with Rule XI, § 14(g).</p>

Bar R. XI, § 14(g), and that, consequently, his suspension should date from the time he filed his June 2008 affidavit complying with Rule XI, § 14(g). Bar Counsel asserted in its brief, and at oral argument, that Mr. Weekes’s sanction should commence as of June 24, 2008. Bar Counsel further insisted that Mr. Weekes should be disbarred because his misconduct constituted intentional misappropriation. During his rebuttal argument, Mr. Weekes opposed Bar Counsel’s advocacy of his disbarment.</p>

After applying these factors, the Board concluded that Mr. Susman had complied with the core requirements of the § 14(g) affidavit by stating, “at the time of my suspension from the Bar of the District of Columbia, I had no clients to notify of my suspension and therefore did not notify anyone.” In contrast to Mr. Susman’s declaration, Mr. Weekes stated in his 2005 affidavit: “Since the effective date of the order of temporary suspension from the practice of law by the [Massachusetts court], I have not practiced law in the District of Columbia during this temporary suspension imposed by the [Massachusetts court].” Mr. Weekes’s statement in his affidavit does not expressly declare that he had no clients, retained or non-retained, to notify. Although he emphasized that he was on active military duty from January 2003 to May 2005, he did not submit his initial affidavit until October 19, 2005. Thus, there were several months during which he may have had clients — either under a retainer or without a retainer agreement.

Therefore, the Board concluded that the second <em>Susman </em>factor did not undercut an opportunity to submit a supplemental affidavit.

Thus, as the Board recognized, Mr. Weekes’s case is readily distinguishable from both <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Slattery. </em>As in <em>Barrett, </em>the Massachusetts court did not sanction Mr. Weekes with disbarment (although it could have). Rather, it decided that the stipulated indefinite suspension was appropriate in light of Mr. Weekes’s full restitution to HM. Similarly, the Board here followed Massachusetts in Mr. Weekes’s case, recognizing that: “under principles of reciprocal discipline, it is appropriate to defer to the Massachusetts finding, particularly where, as here, the [e]ourt could have considered the same mitigation had this case been before it as an original matter.” Hence, the Board has recommended, as in <em>Hallal, </em>that “the functionally equivalent discipline of a five-year suspension with a requirement to prove fitness to practice as a condition of reinstatement” be imposed on Mr. Weekes as a sanction. <a href="/a2d/944/1085-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="944 A.2d 1085" data-case-ids="8387939" data-case-paths="/a2d/944/1085-01">944 A.2d at 1086</a>.
