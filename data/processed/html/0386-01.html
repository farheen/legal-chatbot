    <p id="b445-23" data-blocks='[["BL_445.22",445,[985,1664,753,607]]]'>On September 4, 1994, Wilkes-Barre police officer Brian Horst observed a vehicle traveling the wrong way on a one-way street. Officer Horst stopped the vehicle which was operated by Hatalski. Observing several in-dicia of intoxication, Officer Horst had Hatal-ski perform field sobriety tests which she failed. Officer Horst placed Hatalski under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Officer Horst transported Hatalski to the Luzerne County Central Processing Center for a breathalyzer test.

Officer Horst turned Hatalski over to Jackson Township Police Officer Jerome Leedock, who also observed indicia of intoxication in Hatalski’s appearance. Before requesting that Hatalski take the breathalyzer test, Officer Leedock read the Implied Con<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>sent Law and O’Connell<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> warnings from a form.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After Officer Leedock had read the form to Hatalski, she claimed that she was still confused as to her rights and wanted to speak with someone. Officer Leedock again explained the warnings to Hatalski, stating that the right to speak with counsel applied only later when she would be questioned. While Hatalski still stated that she did not understand why she could not speak with someone, she verbally assented to submit to the breathalyzer test. Hatalski failed to provide sufficient air to perform the test but claimed she was blowing as hard as she could. Officer Leedock expressed that Ha-talski was “faking” her inability to provide sufficient air. After several attempts by Ha-talski, the breathalyzer test machine ran through its cycle without receiving adequate samples. Officer Leedock considered Hatal-ski’s conduct a refusal.</p>

(Trial Court Finding of Fact 5.) Hatalski also testified that stress brings upon episodes of her mitral value prolapse condition. Although she knew of her medical condition, Hatalski testified that she did not tell Officer Leedock of the condition because of her confusion and the stress associated with being arrested. (Trial Court Finding of Fact 7.)</p>

      <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>The trial court found that Dr. Memo’s report was competent medical evidence and that <em>at the time </em>of the testing Hatalski experienced an episode of mitral valve prolapse which rendered her incapable of successfully completing the breathalyzer test. The trial court concluded that Hatalski made a good-faith effort to provide the samples but that her medical condition did not allow her to successfully provide them. The trial court also excused Hatalski from the requirement of notifying the testing officer of a condition which would prevent her from supplying an adequate sample because she was under stress at the time of the test. The trial court also concluded that the <em>O’Connell </em>explanation given to Hatalski was legally insufficient because Officer Leedock did not give Hatalski a sufficient reason why she had no right to contact someone prior to the testing. (Trial Court Conclusion of Law at 7.) Thus, the trial court sustained Hatalski’s appeal.</p>
    <p id="b447-4" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[200,1301,751,802]]]'>DOT now appeals to this Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> arguing that the trial court erred as a matter of law in holding that Hatalski could not make a knowing and conscious refusal because <em>O’Connell </em>does not apply in this case. In the alternative, DOT argues that Officer Leedock provided a legally sufficient <em>O’Connell </em>warning to Hatalski. DOT argues that the trial court erred in excusing Hatalski from the requirement of notifying Officer Leedock of the condition which allegedly prevented her from providing an adequate sample. DOT also argues that the trial court erred in considering Dr. Memo’s report over its objection that it did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Memo on the contents of his report.</p>

We find this argument persuasive because while Hatalski continued asking to speak with someone after <em>O’Connell </em>warnings had been given, she did not refuse to submit to the breathalyzer test. Hatalski verbally assented to the test but then failed to successfully complete the test because she did not provide two consecutive, sufficient breath samples as required by 67 Pa.Code § 77.24(b). In <em>Halford v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Traffic Safety, </em>136 Pa.Cmwlth. 421, <a href="/citations/?q=683%20A.2d%2070" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="683 A.2d 70">683 A.2d 70</a> (1990), after initially displaying confusion concerning his rights, the arrestee verbally assented to take the breathalyzer test. Upon performing the test, he failed to supply sufficient air into the testing machine which the police recorded as a refusal. On appeal, the arrestee argued that because he had been confused about his rights that he did not knowingly and consciously refuse the test. We did not agree, holding that the arrestee’s refusal resulted from his failure to supply enough air into the machine and not any confusion regarding his rights and therefore, an <em>O’Connell </em>analysis was not at issue.</p>
    <p id="b447-10" data-blocks='[["BL_447.9",447,[996,1303,751,657]]]'>Here, Hatalski displayed initial confusion concerning her rights but eventually assented to take the breathalyzer test, as did the arrestee in <em>Halford. </em>Hatalski, too, did not provide sufficient samples as the arrestee in <em>Halford. </em>We hold that any alleged confusion which Hatalski may have demonstrated was vitiated by her subsequent verbal assent to take the test. Thus, the trial court erred in holding that Hatalski was confused concerning her rights under <em>O’Connell </em>because <em>O’Connell </em>does not apply in a case where the arrestee verbally assents to take the breathalyzer test.</p>

DOT argues that the trial court erred in excusing Hatalski from failing to inform Office Leedock because no substantial evidence supports the finding that her excited and emotional state <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>following the arrest would excuse her from making a knowing and conscious refusal. In <em>Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Wilhelm, </em>166 Pa.

If the officer was not so notified, the licensee is precluded from relying upon any such condition or inability as an affirmative defense to a suspension as a consequence of a test refusal. <em>Larkin v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Pa.Cmwlth. 611, <a href="/pa-commw/109/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="531 A.2d 844" data-case-ids="1363593" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/109/0611-01">531 A.2d 844</a> (1987). The licensee has the burden of proving that he or she was so overwrought <em>at the time of the testing </em>he or she could not notify the testing officer of his or her physical incapability. <em>Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Holsten, </em>150 Pa.Cmwlth. 1, <a href="/pa-commw/150/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="615 A.2d 113" data-case-ids="1436578" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/150/0001-01">615 A.2d 113</a> (1992). Before a trial court can excuse a licensee’s failure to inform the tester of such medical condition, the licensee must present competent, unequivocal expert evidence as to the severity of his or her emotional state following the drunk driving arrest and how that severe emotional state precluded the licensee from recalling something as significant as a medical condition which renders him or her incapable of performing the breathalyzer test.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[231,1909,748,552]],["BL_448.5",448,[1033,253,746,755]]]'>In <em>Pollock v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em>160 Pa.

She refused to submit to the breathalyzer test and DOT subsequently suspended her driving privileges. On appeal, the licensee argued that the trial court erred in holding that her refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test was knowing and conscious because she had sustained obvious physical injuries. Citing <em>Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Walsh, </em>146 Pa.Cmwlth. 461, <a href="/pa-commw/146/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="606 A.2d 583" data-case-ids="1428658" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/146/0461-01">606 A.2d 583</a> (1992), we held even where a licensee has sustained injuries, but does not suffer from an obvious inability to comply with the testing request, competent medical testimony is required to prove that a knowing and conscious refusal could not be made. Even the licensee’s description of her physical and emotional state in <em>Pollock, </em>did not rise to the level of obvious, severe and incapacitating injuries which relieved the licensee of her burden to introduce expert medical testimony to prove her inability to make a knowing and conscious refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test.</p>

Hatalski argues that DOT did not properly raise a specific hearsay objection to Dr. Memo's report and therefore, the objection was not properly raised in the trial court and cannot be reviewed by this Court, citing <em>Stine v. Department of Transportation, </em>26 Pa.Cmwlth. 292, <a href="/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20745" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="364 A.2d 745">364 A.2d 745</a> (1976). While DOT did not use the word "hearsay,” it is obvious that its objection was based upon hearsay as hearsay evidence is subject to exclusion primarily because the declarant, who is not present in court, cannot be subjected to cross examination. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>§ 245 (3d ed. 1984).</p>
