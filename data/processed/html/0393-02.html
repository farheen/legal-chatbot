    <p id="b448-18" data-blocks='[["BL_448.19",448,[1034,653,747,516]]]'>In July, 1986, a vehicle operated by appel-lee Graham collided with a vehicle operated by appellant Bennett in which appellant Me-bane was a passenger. The accident occurred at an intersection regulated by traffic lights. There were no other witnesses to the accident and the occupants of each car claimed that the other vehicle ran a red light. The occupants of both vehicles suffered personal injuries to varying degrees and were treated at a local hospital.</p>

      <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>During Officer Loughery’s pre-trial deposition, counsel agreed that all objections would be reserved for trial. Officer Loughery was questioned as to his professional experience and training; he responded that he had received instruction in accident investigation during his police academy training and that over the course of a twenty year career he had personally responded to a “few hundred” accident scenes. Deposition of C. Loughery at 5. He was neither offered nor accepted as an expert witness during this deposition or at trial. Appellants’ counsel, again asserting that objections were reserved for trial, asked for Loughery’s opinion as to who ran the red light. Loughery answered, “If I can recall correctly to be honest with you ... I think it looked like [Bennett’s vehicle] went through the red light.” Deposition of C. Loughery at 17. Loughery subsequently expressed additional reservations as to the accuracy of his recall and admitted that he believed that his opinion was based upon his conversations with the vehicles’ occupants and the vehicles’ locations in the intersection. Deposition of C. Loughery at 18.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[177,1500,751,747]]]'>At trial, the only independent evidence regarding the cause of the accident was Loughery’s deposition testimony that, to the best of his recollection, it was his opinion that the Bennett car was the cause of the accident. Portions of Loughery’s deposition were read into the record because he had been subpoenaed for the third day of trial, but due to the celerity with which the proceedings progressed the trial lasted only two days and Loughery was deemed unavailable. Appellants’ counsel objected to the admission of the portion containing Loughery’s belief as to who caused the accident and was overruled. Appellants’ counsel then moved for a mistrial. The motion was denied.</p>

Appellants filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, a new trial. After oral argument, both motions were denied. The Superior Court adopted the trial court’s opinion and affirmed the judgment denying appellants’ motion for reargument. We granted allocatur to determine whether the trial court committed reversible error by admitting into evidence the opinion of a police officer, not qualified as an expert, elicited during a deposition when the officer did not personally witness the accident and was deemed unavailable for trial.</p>

Even so, as a discretionary matter, if the proper foundation had been laid, and Officer Lough-ery had been properly qualified and offered as an expert, the trial court could have admitted his testimony as evidence if, after due consideration, it had determined that Officer Loughery’s experience satisfied the standard stated above. In this case, nothing indicates <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>that this happened. Officer Loughery was never present at the trial and there is no indication that any attempt was made to lay a foundation which would have enabled ap-pellees’ counsel to offer him as an expert; indeed, he was never so offered. Therefore, the trial court never considered whether or not he possessed sufficient specialized knowledge to qualify as an expert witness, instead relying on the fact that the objectionable testimony was elicited by appellants’ own counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[214,850,756,652]]]'>Since Officer Loughery had not been properly qualified and accepted as an expert, he could only testify as to the facts that he personally witnessed. His opinion testimony as to who ran the red light was admittedly highly speculative and based, at least in part, on the out of court statements given by the occupants of the vehicles. This testimony was, therefore, inadmissible. Indeed, it is difficult to ascertain precisely what type of experience or training would qualify anyone, whether expert or layman, to give a reasonably certain opinion as to the color of a fight that he had not seen.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[213,1554,753,275]]]'>Furthermore, the objectionable testimony in this case was elicited during deposition and not during trial as in <em>Gilliard, supra. </em>Facts or opinions discoverable during depositions are not automatically admissible at trial.

The rules are not waived simply because the inadmissible evidence emerges as a result of inquiry by a party to whom the evidence may be potentially damaging. Counsel must be allowed the latitude to pursue avenues of inquiry which may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence without the fear of inadmissible evidence discovered along the way being used against them. Discovery cannot achieve its aims of crystallizing the facts and issues for trial if counsel are to be subject to the same evidentiary limitations encountered at trial.</p>
    <p id="b450-15" data-blocks='[["BL_450.15",450,[1012,1748,750,749]]]'>In this case, counsel reserved objections for trial and pursued a fine of inquiry that potentially could have crystallized the facts and issues for both parties. When the deposition was sought to be introduced at trial, counsel raised his objections in a timely manner, allowing the court opportunity to ensure that evidentiary rules were followed. Relying upon inapposite caselaw, the court failed to do so, in effect circumventing the rules of evidence and allowing the introduction of that which would normally be inadmissible. We hold, therefore, that the court abused its discretion in allowing the police officer’s deposition testimony regarding causation to be read into the record.</p>
