The referee then determined that Squires had been dependent on the decedent at the time of his death, but that the dependency ceased in February 1990. At that time, Squires’ social security benefits, which, due to a prior overpayment, had been suspended since sometime before her son’s death, were reinstated.

Relevant to the statutory priority of children and parents, section 307 provides “[i]f members of decedent’s household at the time of his death, the terms ‘child’ and ‘children’ shall include step-children, adopted children and children to whom he stood in loco parentis, and shall include posthumous children.” 77 P.S. § 562. There is no evidence that the child in question here falls into this statutory definition. Nor is there authority for providing benefits under section 307 to a person based solely on cohabitation, which is the only relationship between the decedent and the child deducible from the record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As for the requirement that Squires be dependent “to any extent on the employe,” we conclude, and Claws Refuse does not dispute, that the record supports by substantial evidence Squires’ dependency on the decedent at the time of injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Therefore, the Board correctly af<a id="p744" href="#p744" data-label="744" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*744</a>firmed the referee’s order granting benefits to Squires.</p>

Claws Refuse states that Squires testified her expenses were approximately $700 per week and that the decedent contributed between $400 and $500. However, Squires estimated the $700 figure as a monthly figure and was referring to her expenses in September 1988, before <a id="p744" href="#p744" data-label="744" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*744</a>her social security payments were cut off and over a year before the decedent’s death.

This particular provision is also arguably the only express statutory limitation on the duration of a dependent parent's benefits, although in <em>Broadwood </em>we essentially derived another statutory limitation from the provision in section 307 that ''Compensation shall be payable under this section to or on account of any child, brother, or sister, only if and while such child, brother, or sister, is under the age of eighteen ...” 77 P.S. § 562; we stated in <em>Broadwood </em>that we had previously determined that the dependent parent’s dependency and concomitant compensability existed "on account of” educational expenses of the deceased employee's sister, which the dependent parent was obligated to provide until the child reached the age of eighteen. <em>Id. </em>at 217-218, <a href="/pa-commw/112/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="535 A.2d 272" data-case-ids="1368034" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/112/0213-01">535 A.2d at 273-274</a>.</p>

In DeGuf-froy the employer filed a modification petition, contending that the claimant’s status had changed insofar as her income exceeded her expenses. There, the Court noted that Section 413 of the Act, 71 P.S. § 772, governing <em>modification or termination, </em>has no provision recognizing an economic change in the status of a dependent parent. However, the instant case is an appeal from an initial determination of dependency, which is governed by Section 307(5) and is thus distinguishable.</blockquote>
