The fire was caused by an employee of Knowles Industrial Services, Corp., which had contracted to remove lead paint from and repaint the exterior of the Church. Reliance National Indemnity, Federal Insurance Co., Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co., and Wassau Employers Insurance Co. — subrogating insurers of the Church — appeal from a summary judgment entered in the Superior Court (York County, <em>Fritzsche, J.). </em>The court found that the waiver of subrogation in the Church’s contract with Knowles barred the insurers’ claims. The insurers argue that the summary judgment was improper because (1) the court made impermissible determinations of fact; (2) the court erred in enforcing the waiver of sub-rogation because it is void as against public policy; and (3) the court erred in applying the waiver of subrogation to Nutec Industrial Chemical, Inc., Clarence E. Smith, Inc., and Camger Chemical Systems, Inc. We affirm the judgment.</p>
