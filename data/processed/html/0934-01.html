In the former case, the judgment, if rendered upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action.

If such defences were not presented in the action, and established by competent evidence, the subsequent allegation of their existence is of no legal consequence. The judgment is as conclusive, so far as future proceedings at law are concerned, as though the defences never existed. The language, therefore, which is so often used, that a judgment estops not only as to every ground of recovery or defence actually presented in ' the action, but also as to every ground which might have been presented, is strictly accurate, when applied to the demand or claim in controversy. Such demand or claim, having passed into judgment, can not again be brought into litigation between the parties in proceedings at law upon any ground whatever.</blockquote>

In all cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the estoppel pf a judgment rendered upon the one cause of action to matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must always be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action, not what might have been thus litigated and determined.

      <a id="p940" href="#p940" data-label="940" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*940</a>By enacting section 13, it clearly appears that the Congress was fully aware of the fact that a person who might be <em>injwed </em>by the registration of a mark, might not have his attention called to the publication provided for in section 6. See <em>Planten </em>v. Gedney, <a href="/f/224/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="224 F. 382" data-case-ids="6739746" data-case-paths="/f/224/0382-01">224 Fed. 382</a>.</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[218,485,1322,732]]]'>Of course, an interested person may waive his statutory right to <em>offose </em>a registration and, in case the mark is registered, file an application for <em>cancellation </em>of the registration. Furthermore, it is possible that an issue might be raised in a cancellation proceeding that could not have been presented in an opiiosition proceeding, for example, a registrant might abandon his <em>registered, </em>mark. Section 13 seem to cover such a situation. But surely, it was never contemplated by the Congress that one who thought he would be damaged by the registration of a mark might litigate his claims or demands in an opposition proceeding and then, if defeated, retry those claims or demands in a cancellation proceeding. Nor do we think it was intended that an opposer might present some of his claims against the registration of a mark in an opposition proceeding, and, if defeated as to those claims, present others in an application' for cancellation.</p>
