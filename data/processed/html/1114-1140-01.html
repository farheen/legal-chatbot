After construing the statutory reference to “an accused” as including defense counsel for purposes of waiver of the right to jury trial, the federal appellate court remarked that Hensley “was apparently content to take his chances [on a non-jury trial], and he cannot now be heard to complain after receiving an unfavorable finding.” <a href="/citations/?q=108%20U.S.%20App.%20D.C.%20242" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="108 U.S. App. D.C. 242">108 U.S.App.D.C. at 245</a>, <a href="/f2d/281/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="281 F.2d 605" data-case-ids="2014544" data-case-paths="/f2d/281/0605-01">281 F.2d at 608</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

First, at least where, as here, the defendant has demanded a jury trial, she must personally waive her right to a jury trial both orally and in writing. The oral waiver should be preceded by a meaningful dialogue between the judge and the defendant in which the judge is persuaded that the defendant has elected voluntarily and knowingly to waive that right. <em>See, Hawkins <a href="/a2d/385/0744-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="385 A.2d 744" data-case-ids="7990659" data-case-paths="/a2d/385/0744-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/385/0744-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="385 A.2d 744" data-case-ids="7990659" data-case-paths="/a2d/385/0744-01">385 A.2d at 747</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Cases like <em>Hicks, </em>in which the defendant said only a single word, and <em>Tinney, </em>where there was no written waiver at all, are most readily explainable by the court’s understandable (and justifiable) reluctance to reverse a conviction for some symbolic error or omission which resulted in no prejudice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> We think that this second goal—an important one—can best be achieved by the judicious fashioning of a remedy, rather than by relaxing unduly the standard set in <em>[Frederick] Jackson </em>and <em>Hawkins.</em>

First, in <em>Hicks, </em>there was no ambiguity as to what the defendant was talking about when he confirmed that he did not want a jury trial. Second, <em>Hicks </em>was decided twenty years ago, and the court made clear its view, which we have reiterated on several occasions since, that a more detailed inquiry should have been conducted. It is reasonable to enforce the requirements of <em>[Frederick] Jackson </em>more vigorously when they have been in effect for twenty-two years than we did in their (comparative) youth.</p>

With respect to Ms. Lopez' remaining contention, we agree with the government that the trial judge did not err by failing to state explicitly in his findings that Ms. Lopez had not acted in self-defense. No specific findings of fact were requested by the defense. <em>See </em>Super.Ct.Crim.R. 23(c); <em>United States v. Ochoa, </em><a href="/f2d/526/1278-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="526 F.2d 1278" data-case-ids="1089282" data-case-paths="/f2d/526/1278-01">526 F.2d 1278</a>, 1282 n. 6 (5th Cir.1976). Moreover, we think that the judge implicitly rejected the self-defense claim in the findings which he did make.</p>
