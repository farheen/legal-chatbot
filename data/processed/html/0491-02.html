Using this standard, the record below establishes the following evidence:</p>
    <p id="b579-9" data-blocks='[["BL_579.6",579,[183,1699,752,315]],["BL_579.7",579,[984,259,754,273]]]'>Appellant and the two co-defendants in this case were members of an organization known as the JBM.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The JBM was an organization which distributed drugs within the city of Philadelphia. In 1990, appellant was the leader of the JBM. Co-defendant Samuel Brown was also a member of the JBM and was approximately third in command. The other co-defendant, James Anderson was a member of the organization who worked as a bodyguard for Leroy Davis, the person who led the Southwest Philadelphia faction of the JBM.</p>
    <p id="b579-13" data-blocks='[["BL_579.8",579,[985,566,754,363]]]'>In May, 1990, Davis was slain. Rodney Carson,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> a Commonwealth witness, testified that he had informed appellant that he suspected that Brian Thornton, another high ranking JBM member, had murdered Davis. Appellant initially disbelieved Carson’s suspicions but ultimately changed his mind, convinced that Thornton had killed Davis.</p>
    <p id="b579-14" data-blocks='[["BL_579.9",579,[982,963,756,893]]]'>Because of appellant’s belief that Thornton killed Davis, a meeting was held on August 17,1990 in the dining room of a house at 46th and Woodland which belonged to Calvin and Mark Brown. Appellant, together with co-defendant Samuel Brown, Christopher Anderson, Calvin and Mark Brown, and Bernard Fields Quadir were present at this meeting. Christopher Anderson<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> testified at trial that since Thornton was incarcerated when this meeting occurred, the meeting concerned who they could “hit” to avenge Davis’ death and to also send a message to Thornton that the killing of a fellow JBM member was not condoned by the JBM or its leaders. Appellant decided that they would kill Thornton’s cousin, Bruce Kennedy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> and that Christopher Anderson and James Anderson would execute the murder.</p>

When they arrived, appellant pulled James Anderson aside and co-defendant Brown informed James Anderson of the plan to murder the victim at his store, a small convenience store called “Mommies” at 54th and Harlin Streets in West Philadelphia. Co-defendants Brown and James Anderson, along with Christopher Anderson, then drove to the victim’s store to plan the logistics of the murder. Later that evening, appellant instructed co-defendant Brown and Christopher Anderson to obtain a car from a person named “Eggie” to use in the murder so that the car could not be traced to anyone in the JBM.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[211,1138,754,517]]]'>On August 18,1990, the day of the murder, co-defendant Brown instructed Christopher and James Anderson to obtain black sweat suits, which they did. Co-defendant Brown also supplied them with black leather gloves. To carry out the assassination, Christopher Anderson armed himself with a nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun provided by co-defendant Brown. James Anderson armed himself with a nine millimeter MAC-11 machine gun.</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[211,1679,754,461]]]'>James Anderson and Christopher Anderson then drove to the victim’s store in the car provided by Eggie. They initially proceeded into the store at approximately 4:10 p.m. to see if the victim was present. After determining that the victim was present, the two Andersons left the store and returned to the car to don their hooded sweat suits and gloves and to arm themselves for the murder.</p>

Three of the store employees were working in the front of the store. James Anderson pulled the MAC-11 from under his sweat suit and proceeded to the back of the store where he killed the victim by firing at least ten shots into his body. Upon hearing these shots, the three workers fled from the store at which time Christopher Anderson fired upon them hitting one of them in the shoulder.</p>
    <p id="b580-10" data-blocks='[["BL_580.11",580,[1013,415,752,458]]]'>After the shooting, James Anderson and Christopher Anderson abandoned their car and discarded the firearms and clothes near train tracks by the Philadelphia Zoo. James Anderson then called Carson to pick him up at 29th and Girard in Philadelphia. Carson testified that when he met and picked up the two Andersons in his ear, that James Anderson informed him how they had killed the victim.</p>
    <p id="b580-11" data-blocks='[["BL_580.12",580,[1013,902,753,702]]]'>Christopher Anderson further testified that later on that evening he informed co-defendant Brown that police were seen near Anderson’s mother’s house. Accordingly, co-defendant Brown took Anderson to see appellant Jones about seeking refuge. Appellant told Brown to take Christopher Anderson to a certain hotel and gave him money to pay for the hotel. Co-defendant Brown took Christopher Anderson to what was known at that time as the Airport Tower Hilton. Brown registered for the room under his own name and signed the registration card.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> It is there that Christopher Anderson hid until the next day.</p>

Appellant submits that the trial court’s denial of his motion for severance prejudiced him because his co-defendants pursued antagonistic defenses which relied, in part, upon evidence regarding the JBM’s other criminal acts and functions in an attempt to portray themselves as insignificant foot soldiers who were only following appellant’s orders.

Such a unified strategy does not represent the type of antagonistic or conflicting defenses which would mandate a severance. Moreover, a severance would not have insulated appellant from evidence about the hierarchy of the JBM or that he ordered the victim’s murder since such evidence was admissible to show appellant’s participation in the conspiracy and motive to murder the victim. Finally, the trial in this case was a lengthy one. It consisted of three days of voir dire and nine days of testimony and argument before a verdict was reached. Twenty-three (28) witnesses testified at trial and this testimony produced a large record. To have conducted separate trials for each defendant would have placed a heavy burden upon the judicial system as well as the public. Accordingly, since appellant cannot show the level of prejudice required for us to find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for severance, this claim must fail.</p>

During direct, the Commonwealth initially asked Carson about the JBM’s general activities. Carson testified that they were involved in distributing cocaine and heroin. After properly setting the stage, the Commonwealth then inquired into the JBM’s usage of the phrase “get down or lay down” in order to expand the JBM drug network. Before Carson replied, the trial court instructed the jury that such evidence was only admissible as to motive and that the JBM was not on trial. Carson then explained that “get down or lay down” was used by the JBM to inform independent drug dealers that either they buy their drugs from the JBM or else they would be killed.

The trial court sustained the objection but denied the motion for a mistrial. Appellant suffered no prejudice from this because the trial court instructed the jury that testimony objected to by counsel and sustained by the court does not become evidence. <em>See Baker, <a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">supra.</a> </em>(jury assumed to follow instructions on the law).

Even if <em>Williams </em>did not apply, appellant would still not be entitled to relief since a review of the penalty phase shows that these claims are meritless. Appellant first argues that there was insufficient evidence to submit to the jury the aggravating circumstance that his conduct knowingly created “a grave risk of death to others.” 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(d)(7). Here, evidence showed: that appellant ordered Christopher Anderson and James Anderson to murder the victim at his store; that Christopher Anderson shot at store employees while they attempted to flee during the murder; and, that bullets sprayed from the perpetrators’ machine guns intended for the victim could have ricocheted, allowing a jury to infer that they could have hit the other employees.

Appellant raises numerous sub-issues in this claim. The first sub-issue raised concerns the admissibility of Trooper Ansel’s testimony at the sentencing hearing. During Appellant’s sentencing, Trooper Ansel, based on his own personal observation of appellant’s federal trial and his review of the federal record, summarized the evidence at appellant’s federal trial in order to support the Commonwealth’s assertion that the acts underlying appellant’s federal convictions were acts ■ of violence. Trooper Ansel’s summarization was based upon testimony presented at appellant’s federal trial for which appellant was present, represented by counsel, and afforded the opportunity to extensively cross-examine the witnesses who testified against him. Appellant does not challenge the veracity of Trooper Ansel’s summarization. Instead, appellant’s sole claim is that this summarization was inadmissible because it constituted hearsay. Even if Trooper Ansel’s summarization was hearsay, we find that its admission constitutes harmless error since the jury did not find the existence of this aggravating circumstance. <em>See Williams, supra, Christy, <a href="/pa/511/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="193" data-cite="511 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1798743" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0490-01">supra.</a></em>

Here, the trial court declined to give such an instruction and allowed the jury to decide what the federal charges involved. Even if the court erred in not explaining the federal charges as appellant requested, such error was harmless because the trial court allowed appellant to make this argument to the jury in its penalty phase closing (N.T. 1/21/93, 107-111) and the jury failed to find this aggravating circumstance.</p>
