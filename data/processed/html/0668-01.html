Murphy, Jr., and his wife, Jane, seek to recover damages which they say occurred as a result of the wrongful conduct of the defendant, Dr. Francis W. Godwin. The suit centers about the failure of Dr. Godwin to return promptly to the New York Life Insurance Company an attending physician’s statement required by the company as a prerequisite to its underwriting a health insurance policy for the Murphys. The plaintiffs say that as a result of Dr. Godwin’s failure to promptly return the form after it had been indicated he would return it, they were uninsured during a period in which they incurred substantial medical expenses. They charge the doctor with intentional interference with contractual relations, actionable deceit and negligence.</p>

Early in July, 1970, Mrs. Murphy, who was at that time about four to six months pregnant, developed a high fever and pains in her lower back. She called Dr. Walker; but he was not in and Mrs. Murphy was advised by Dr. Dear-worth, an associate of Dr. Walker. Dr. Dearworth thought that Mrs. Murphy should be checked for possible appendicitis and on July 13, 1970, he told her to go to the emergency room of the Wilmington General Hospital to be examined by a surgeon.</p>
    <p id="b708-16" data-blocks='[["BL_708.19",708,[967,1456,753,608]]]'>Mrs. Murphy went to the hospital on July 13, 1970, and was first examined by Dr. Mansoory, a surgeon. Dr. Mansoory indicated that since Mrs. Murphy was pregnant, she should be examined by an obstetrician. Mrs. Murphy had no obstetrician. The defendant, Dr. Godwin, who is an obstetrician, was in the hospital at the time and he was called to examine her. Dr. Godwin diagnosed Mrs. Murphy’s condition as a kidney infection and anemia. He committed her to the hospital for treatment.</p>
    <p id="b708-17" data-blocks='[["BL_708.20",708,[965,2107,751,370]]]'>Mrs. Murphy says that Dr. Godwin told her that “he would take over”, and it appears that he alone attended Mrs. Murphy while she was hospitalized. On July 19, 1970, Mrs. Murphy was discharged from the hospital by Dr. Godwin, who told her to call his office for an appointment in about six weeks.</p>

They contacted a New York Life Insurance agent named Charles Mason. On July 22, 1970, they made application for a policy, remitting with the application the first month’s premium. There is nothing in the record to dispute Mason’s deposition testimony that the policy would have been retroactively effective had the underwriting requirements of the company been met in a timely manner, subject, of course, to the Murphys accepting whatever underwriting conditions the company may have required after reviewing their medical history.</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.4",709,[125,932,752,1006]]]'>Mr. Murphy’s kidney infection was listed on the application and Dr. Godwin was named as the physician treating that illness. Consequently, on July 30, 1970, New York Life sent to Dr. Godwin, from its home office, a routine form known as an “attending physician’s statement”. The form was apparently a standard form and states on its face that it was “developed by the Health Insurance Council and approved by the Council on Medical Services of the AMA in 1965”. The form consists of a single page containing five questions. Four of the questions seek information concerning diagnosis, treatment and present condition as to the specific illnesses treated by the physician and the fifth question asks for any other information bearing on the patient’s health. It may fairly be described as a concise and relatively simple form.</p>

Approximately ten days after July 30, the company sent Dr. Godwin a reminder notice. Mr. Mason says that the reminder notice provided a phone number in New York which the doctor might call in lieu of completing the form. On August 12, 1970, Mr. Mason personally visited Dr. Godwin’s office and asked that the form be completed and returned. He spoke to the nurse-receptionist, who told him that the matter would be taken care of.</p>

He took a second copy of the form and was again told that the matter would be taken care of. Mr. Mason also telephoned the doctor’s office several times during the month of August and says that on each of his phone calls and visits he told the persons with whom he spoke that the form was needed “immediately”.</p>

She called Dr. Godwin, who told her to come to the hospital, where he examined her and determined that she could be sent home for a day or two. On September 2, 1970, Mrs. Murphy returned to the hospital and Dr. Godwin delivered twins, both of whom were born with congenital illnesses. The daughter and son were required to remain in the hospital for one and two months respectively, and the son continues to suffer from his complications.</p>

Mr. Murphy denies ever having received this letter. He admits, however, that at some later date he was told by Charles Mason that the application had been declined but could be reactivated if and when the form requested of Dr. God-win were received. The exact date upon which the Murphys had notice of the company’s declination remains in issue upon the present record.</p>

Mrs. Murphy suffered a ruptured appendix and was hospitalized from September 25, 1970, to October 26, 1970. Mr. Murphy was injured in a fall caused by an apparent seizure and was hospitalized from October 24, 1970, to November 3, 1970.</p>

These contacts included a personal visit by the two of them together during which visit they were told by the receptionist that the form had been lost. Charles Mason says he asked to see Mrs. Murphy’s file and when it was produced, he found the form in the doctor’s file.</p>

The Murphys then attempted to file a claim against the company for the expenses which they had incurred as a result of the family’s various illnesses in September, October and November of 1970, described above. The claim was denied and the Murphys brought this action against Dr. Godwin.</p>

    <p id="b710-9" data-blocks='[["BL_710.9",710,[990,340,753,665]]]'>The plaintiffs charge Dr. Godwin in Count I with intentional interference with contractual relations. They concede that there was no consummated contract between them and the company but rely upon a theory variously described as intentional interference with reasonable economic expectancy, or intentional interference with prospective advantage under contract. See Prosser, The Law of Torts (4th ed.) § 130. This form of tort has been implicitly recognized in Delaware, Metropolitan Convoy Corp. v.

There are issues of material fact as to the relationship of the parties, the details of their communications and the reasonableness of defendant’s delay. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment as to Count 111 must be denied.</p>
    <p id="b712-11" data-blocks='[["BL_712.11",712,[1014,2048,750,320]]]'>Defendant has also moved for partial summary judgment limiting his liability to medical expenses of plaintiffs arising on or before September 7, 1970, upon the theory that after that date the plaintiffs had notice that their insurance application had been denied.</p>
    <p id="b712-12" data-blocks='[["BL_712.12",712,[1014,2425,750,279]],["BL_713.1",713,[111,189,754,1107]]]'>However, the date upon which the Mur-phys had such notice remains in issue upon the present record. Furthermore, if it is shown that the only reason the insurance was refused was the actionable, negligent failure of the doctor to supply necessary <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>information, the consequence of such failure would not necessarily end with the September 7 notice. Beyond the issues of material fact discussed above, the question of the limitations of the defendant’s potential liability requires a more complete consideration of the facts and the law. For those reasons I decline at this point to grant partial summary judgment as to the limits of defendant’s potential liability. Ebersole v. Lowengrub, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Storey%20463" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Storey 463">4 Storey 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20467" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="180 A.2d 467">180 A.2d 467</a>, (Del.Supr.1962). It is clear, however, that if liability is found to exist, such liability would not go beyond the immediate scope of the exact insurance contract which plaintiffs must show they would have obtained but for the doctor’s alleged negligence. Additional insurance coverage not then applied for covering children not yet born and possible recovery under such coverage would almost surely be deemed to be beyond the scope of the potential liability.</p>
