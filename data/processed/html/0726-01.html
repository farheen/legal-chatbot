On the evening of August 20, 1976, Richard and Patricia Young drove along Alcohol Mary Road, a dirt road maintained by the town of Greenwood, where a residence owned by Mr. Young’s parents was located. Appellant’s farm was also located on Alcohol Mary Road. Appellant and his friends had partially blockaded the road with a tractor and had started a bonfire on the side of the road. Mr. Young, who had known the appellant for thirteen years, stopped his automobile. Appellant approached the car with his .44 magnum revolver in his hand and stated:</p>

The doctor further testified that appellant’s thought processes were consistent with a delusional state that he was back in the marines and had a duty to guard a tower which was at the end of the road on which the shooting incident took place.

Dr. Jacobsohn conceded that the use of marijuana might possibly trigger an LSD flashback. Appellant’s dilated pupils at the time of his arrest were also consistent with LSD use.
