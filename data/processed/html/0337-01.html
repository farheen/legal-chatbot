Two of the victims were sisters, D.V., eleven years old, and S.V., eight years old for whom, in 1995, Merolla was hired as a piano instructor. During the piano lessons, Merolla fondled and kissed them. Although the piano lessons were terminated, Merolla re-established contact with the family sometime between 1999 and 2001, offering a free place to live in exchange for their mother’s taking care of his parents and cleaning the house. While the family resided with Merolla’s parents, he touched the girls’ breasts, buttocks, and vaginal areas. He also made sexual comments to both girls, including offers of money to have sex with him, and suggested that their encounters be videotaped to sell on the Internet. One of the girls claimed that Merolla forcibly attempted to have intercourse with her but was unsuccessful.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Dean Dickson, the member of the Board who made the evaluation, testified that Merolla should be assigned SVP status because he suffered from pedophilia and paraphilia which made him likely to engage in predatory, sexually violent offenses. The de-fensé presented Dr. Robert Gordon, a psychologist who, after conducting objective testing concluded that Merolla should not be classified as an SVP despite his plea to sexual offenses. Finding Dickson’s testimony less than credible, the trial court determined that Merolla was not an SVP, and sentenced him to <em>lllk </em>to 23 months’ imprisonment for the statutory sexual assault charge, with two consecutive sentences of 5 to 10 years’ probation on each of the indecent assault charges, resulting in an aggregate probationary period of 10 to 20 years. The trial court also imposed the requirement that he register with state police for a period of ten years pursuant to Megan’s Law II.</p>

However, before considering the merits of the Commonwealth’s appeal, we must determine whether it complies with the Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 1410, the predecessor to Rules 720 and 721 addressed post-sentence motion procedures as they apply to both defendants and the Commonwealth. When Rule 1410 was re-codified as Rule 720 in 1993, Rule 721 was created to clarify procedures for the Commonwealth’s challenges to sentences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Pa.R.Crim.P. 721, <em>Comment </em>While Rule 720 includes a subsection that specifically provides a defendant thirty days to appeal from an “entry of the order denying the motion by operation of law in which the judge fails to decide the motion,” Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(A)(2)(b), a parallel subsection is conspicuously absent from Rule 721. However, for reasons discussed below, we believe that Rule 721 does allow the Commonwealth to appeal the denial of a post-sentence motion by operation of law.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[226,1878,750,243]],["BL_398.6",398,[1022,260,752,1492]]]'>¶ 9 Rule 721(D)(1) directs the clerk of courts to notify the parties once the Commonwealth’s motion for modification is denied by operation of law. Pa.R.Crim.P. 721(D)(1)(a), (b). “If the defendant has not filed a post-sentence motion, the Commonwealth’s notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the entry of the order disposing of the Commonwealth’s motion pursuant to paragraph (C)(2).” Pa. R.Crim.P. 721(B)(2)(b)(ii). Paragraph (C)(2), in turn, directs the trial court to decide the Commonwealth’s motion within 120 days, or else “the motion shall be deemed denied by operation of law.” Pa. R.Crim.P. 721(C)(2). Thus, while Rule 721 does not have a parallel subsection to Rule 720(A)(2)(b), when read as a whole, by implication Rule 721 allows the Commonwealth thirty days to file an appeal. We note that a contrary finding would render unappealable the denial of a Commonwealth motion by operation of law, and we have discovered no relevant authority to support such a policy. Here, on August 9, 2005, pursuant to Rule 721(D)(1), the clerk of courts entered an order denying the Commonwealth’s post-sentence motion by operation of law. Therefore, the Commonwealth had 30 days to file an appeal, and its August 11th appeal was timely. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 721(B)(2)(b)(ii).

While the Sentencing Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> does not define a term of probation to be finite or “flat,” rather than a range of time, we glean such an inference from a reading of the Code as a whole. In determining a sentence, the Code provides that a court may impose probation, a determination of guilt without further penalty, partial or total confinement, a fine, or county or state intermediate punishment. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9721(a). The statutes relating to partial and total confinement provide that a court shall impose a minimum and a maximum sentence. 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9755(b), 9756(b). However, the statute relating to probation orders contains no such limitation, but provide only that the length of probation may not exceed the maximum term for which a defendant could be confined. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9754(a). Thus, we also remand to the trial court to impose terms of probation consistent with this restriction.</p>
