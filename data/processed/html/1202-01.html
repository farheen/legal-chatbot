The suppression court denied the motion, concluding that (1) the officers made a lawful traffic stop of Appellant’s vehicle to investigate the damage to the vehicle and whether the damage to the vehicle constituted a safety concern; (2) the officers acted reasonably in investigating the circumstances of the presence of a firearm on Appellant’s person and acted appropriately in their attempts to secure the firearm in furtherance of their own safety as well as the public safety; and (3) the officers had probable cause to arrest Appellant in light of the fact that Appellant appeared to possess a weapon and was resisting efforts to secure the weapon. Accordingly, the suppression court denied Appellant’s motion to suppress the firearm found on Appellant’s person. However, the court also determined that a subsequent warrantless search of the trunk of Appellant’s vehicle was not lawful. Consequently, the court suppressed the evidence found in the trunk, namely a bulletproof vest, a rifle scope, and a rifle stock.</p>
