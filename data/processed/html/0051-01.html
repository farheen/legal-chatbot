Landow and his landlord, appellant Robert W. Ayers, had been embroiled for several years in a dispute regarding the proper rent level. As a result of this dispute, Landow had been paying the equivalent of his rent into the registry of the Superior Court pursuant to a protective order. In October 1993, the amount in the registry was approximately $24,000.</p>

When he went to investigate, Landow was not at home. Ayers and his employees entered the apartment with a pass key. They found water running at “virtually full force” from the sink, evidently because the trap was broken. There was a pot placed under the trap, which led Ayers to believe that Landow knew of the leak but had failed to report it to the landlord.</p>

On March 12, 1993, Ayers’ attorneys sent to Landow, by certified mail, a “Notice to Cure Violation of Tenancy or Vacate.” Subsequently, on <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>March 17, March 19, April 7, and April 9, 1993, a process server attempted to effect personal service of the notice on Landow.

It does not contemplate some kind of blanket prophylactic earlier mailing, and in this instance, as I recall, the evidence revealed that there was a mailing some ... [s]even days prior to posting in the case. It seems to me that the plain meaning of that statute is that if you have been unable to effect the two preferred kinds of service for a notice to cure, then, if you post, you shall mail; and one has to come before the other, it seems to me.</blockquote>

    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[236,472,755,1031]]]'>The judge next addressed the practical implications of Ayers’ position. He observed that, under the landlord’s proposed construction of § 45-1406, “hypothetically, what you could do is to mail on January 1st and then, when you get around to it in June, you could post, and then wait 30 days and bring a lawsuit at the end of June.” Alternatively, the judge observed, “you could just do a prophylactic mailing of a bunch of notices to cure saying you’ve all <em>got too </em>many people, then wait 60 days, 90 days, see if you’re happy — and post on the people that are still a problem.” The judge concluded that “that kind of ambiguity with regard to this advance mailing, without the predicate [event] having yet occurred of posting, is just clearly not what’s contemplated by the statute.” Finally, he pointed out that “there’s certainly no prejudice or burden on a landlord from complying with a straightforward interpretation of this statute.”</p>

Upon further reflection, however, he concluded that “the <em>Gantt </em>case is clearly distinguishable.” He described <em>Gantt </em>as standing for the proposition that “within,” like other legal terms, does not have a single universal meaning. In <em>Gantt, </em>according to the judge, the use of the word “within”</p>
    <blockquote id="A9m" data-blocks='[["BL_110.8",110,[1075,371,722,364]]]'>was clearly designed to drop a curtain of finality at the end, temporally, and [to] say that beyond this point you shall make no claims against a decedent’s estate.

The judge thus distinguished <em>Gantt </em>essentially upon the ground that the considerations discussed above at pp. 53-54, which in his view rendered Ayers’ construction of § 45-1406 unreasonable and unworkable, were simply not present in <em>Gantt.</em>

    <p id="b110-12" data-blocks='[["BL_110.11",110,[1032,1196,752,1372]]]'>The question whether § 45-1406 permits a mailing a substantial period before service by posting is purely one of law. We therefore need not accord the judge’s ruling any deference, and our review is <em>de novo. Guadalupe v.

We have, however, set forth the trial judge’s reasoning in some detail because, in our view, his construction of the statute, which he gave orally from the bench, was both eloquent and persuasive. We agree with the judge that to read the phrase “within three days,” in the present context, as countenancing mailings effected weeks or even months before the posting on which the landlord relies would create “temporal anarchy” and a host of practical problems which the legislature could not have intended. When, for example, would the tenant be required to “cure or quit” if a letter were mailed to him on January 1, and if a notice were tacked to his door half a year later on four different days in July? Moreover, the letter, by itself, is concededly ineffective to achieve service. It is, in effect, a nullity. We do not believe that such a nullity can be retroactively converted, a substantial period after the fact, into one part of a legally sufficient service of the notice.</p>

The Council of the District of Columbia cannot be supposed to have intended that landlords be permitted to comply with the statute by mailing letters in advance of posting, when those letters might well turn out to be superfluous, and misleading to the tenant as well. The statute requires the mailing of the letter, as the judge pointed out, only <em>if </em>the notice is posted on the premises. When the notice has not been posted, there is nothing in the language or the purpose of the statute which would give effect to any mailing at all.</p>

Specifically, the question is whether the landlord’s mailing the tenant a copy of a Notice to Cure Violation of Tenancy or Vacate on March 12, 1993, followed by a posting of the Notice on the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>tenant’s door on March 19, March 24, April 7, and April 9, 1993, complied with the statutory requirement that</p>

The landlord’s contention was and is that “within three days” is not a fixed period of three days following posting, but can be read as a point of conclusion — a date by which the mailing must occur, but not precluding the mailing prior to the date of posting.

The court reasoned, however, that the landlord’s strict adherence to the statute was of a “wooden manner” that the legislature did not intend. <em><a href="/a2d/527/1292-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="527 A.2d 1292" data-case-ids="7906574" data-case-paths="/a2d/527/1292-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/562/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="562 A.2d 134" data-case-ids="7346031" data-case-paths="/a2d/562/0134-01">562 A.2d at 136</a>. According to the court, the purpose of § 16-1502, the service of summons statute that was amended at the same time as § 45-1406, the service of notice to quit statute, was to help ensure that a tenant was actually provided with the summons. Thus, where a technical application of the statute would not accomplish this goal, technical compliance would not comport with the spirit in which § 16-1502 was enacted. The court concluded that mailing to Colorado, where the landlord knew the tenant to be — and not the rented premises, as the statute requires — would have been statutorily sufficient. The court stated that “[w]e simply make what we think is a commonsense application of that principle [of mailing as an additional assurance of notice when posting occurs] to the facts here.” <em><a href="/a2d/562/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="562 A.2d 134" data-case-ids="7346031" data-case-paths="/a2d/562/0134-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/562/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="562 A.2d 134" data-case-ids="7346031" data-case-paths="/a2d/562/0134-01">at 137</a>.</p>

I recognize that actual notice may not overcome service that clearly fails to comply with any interpretation of the notice statute. <em>See Moody, <a href="/a2d/321/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="321 A.2d 562" data-case-ids="8052407" data-case-paths="/a2d/321/0562-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/321/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="321 A.2d 562" data-case-ids="8052407" data-case-paths="/a2d/321/0562-01">321 A.2d 562</a>, 563 (holding that notice was insufficient because it was slid under the tenant’s door instead of being posted, regardless of the fact that the tenant actually received the notice). However, where no prejudice is alleged by the tenant from the method of service — the case here— and the method of service can be accommodated by the language of the statute, consistent with case law and the statute’s legislative history, the court should not invalidate an otherwise adequate notice to quit. <em>Ontell, <a href="/a2d/527/1292-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="527 A.2d 1292" data-case-ids="7906574" data-case-paths="/a2d/527/1292-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/527/1292-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="527 A.2d 1292" data-case-ids="7906574" data-case-paths="/a2d/527/1292-01">527 A.2d at 1295</a> (holding that notice to an English-speaking commercial tenant was sufficient even though it was written only in English and not also in Spanish as § 45-1406 requires); <em>compare Jones v.

This court suggested in <em>Gantt </em>that the question whether a particular form of notice was legally proper can be answered with reference to whether the server’s interpretation of the notice statute at issue undermined an ascertainable statutory scheme. <em>Gantt, supra, </em><a href="/a2d/558/1120-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="558 A.2d 1120" data-case-ids="11325764" data-case-paths="/a2d/558/1120-01">558 A.2d at 1123-25</a>. In the instant case, the landlord’s service by mailing seven days before the first posting cannot be said to undermine any scheme intended by the legislature. <em>Ontell, <a href="/a2d/527/1292-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="527 A.2d 1292" data-case-ids="7906574" data-case-paths="/a2d/527/1292-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/527/1292-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="527 A.2d 1292" data-case-ids="7906574" data-case-paths="/a2d/527/1292-01">527 A.2d at 1295</a>.

The landlord, through the use of an agent, attempted personal service on four different occasions and, being unsuccessful, posted notice on each of those four different attempts. As the statute requires, the landlord mailed a copy of the notice to the tenant. This effort shows good faith on the part of the landlord to apprise the tenant of the pendency of the action. The landlord <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>violated neither any clear meaning, nor the spirit, of the requirement that a mailing occur within three days of posting, giving the tenant sufficient time to cure before the tenant was served a summons. The landlord, in fact, waited in excess of thirty days after the last posting to file his complaint for possession. The mailing of the copy of the notice seven days prior to the posting of the first notice did not harm the tenant in any way and, in fact, may have benefited the tenant by giving him additional time to cure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a>

The court posed a scenario where, under this interpretation, a landlord could mail a notice on January first and then post in June, or worse yet, initiate a prophylactic mailing to all his tenants, and then post months later on any tenants that the landlord still wishes to evict. Setting aside the fact that in any case, a landlord needs a legally sufficient reason to evict a tenant, it is true that the statute alone would not render this process of notice insufficient. However, the constitutional requirements of <em>Greene </em>clearly would. A mailing that was prophylactic or that occurred months prior to posting would certainly not be “reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action.” <em>Greene, <a href="/us/456/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="456 U.S. 444" data-case-ids="6187594" data-case-paths="/us/456/0444-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/us/456/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="456 U.S. 444" data-case-ids="6187594" data-case-paths="/us/456/0444-01">456 U.S. at 449-50</a>, <a href="/us/456/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="456 U.S. 444" data-case-ids="6187594" data-case-paths="/us/456/0444-01">102 S.Ct. at 1878</a> (emphasis omitted). This is especially the case if the tenant can show that the landlord was simply trying to avoid the spirit of <em>Greene. </em>Therefore, I am not convinced that interpreting the service statute to permit the notice in this ease could have the unintended consequence of allowing a landlord to comply with the language, but not the spirit, of the statute, under different circumstances. Guided by due process requirements, courts will always be able to protect tenants in such cases.</p>
