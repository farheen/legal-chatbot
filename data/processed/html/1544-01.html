    <p id="b652-7" data-blocks='[["BL_652.6",652,[354,630,1121,306]]]'>In June 1989, appellant Edolia Paul and her friend, Mamie McCloud, were in Las Vegas with a church group from Lafayette, Louisiana. On the morning of June 22, the two were in the buffet serving line at Imperial. As Paul reached for a cereal bowl, she slipped and fell on her right shoulder. McCloud heard Paul’s foot slip and saw the end of the fall. McCloud looked at the rug where Paul fell, and it was slick from some kind of oil.</p>
    <p id="b652-8" data-blocks='[["BL_652.7",652,[355,945,1121,312]]]'>Several hotel employees working in that area came running to the scene of the accident. Some of the employees remarla'' that several other people had slipped on the rug recently, tho%.r not that day. Evidence showed that the carpet runners along the food serving area were changed each day before the buffet opened for breakfast and that hostesses monitored the buffet area to make sure that any spilled food was cleaned up.</p>
    <p id="b652-9" data-blocks='[["BL_652.8",652,[355,1265,1122,446]]]'>A doctor in Louisiana later performed surgery on Paul’s arm. The doctor diagnosed Paul’s injury as a torn rotator cuff and adhesive capsulitis, or frozen shoulder. After the operation, Paul had approximately a thirty percent permanent disability in her upper right arm. She decided not to have a second operation because the doctor gave only a twenty percent chance that it would restore full use of her arm. At trial, Paul demonstrated the limits in her arm motion. Since the accident, she could not sleep on her right side because of the pain and could no longer scrub at home or use a mop or broom.</p>

Imperial objected to the instruction. It argued that Paul had not proved the amount or necessity for any future medical expenses or that pain and suffering would continue in the future. Paul’s counsel argued that they had shown that she was in pain which would last for the rest of her life. The district court asked, “you are not going to argue any specific figures?” Paul’s counsel said that he would not, except that Paul would “have to buy a bottle of aspirin and Tylenol from time to time.” The court stated: “If you limit your final argument to that concept, I’ll let you argue that.” Counsel also agreed that he would not argue that future surgery was contemplated. The court stated: “All right, with that understand<a id="p1547" href="#p1547" data-label="1547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1547</a>ing, then.” Imperial did not object to the court’s ruling, and the parties agreed to the verdict forms.</p>

    <blockquote id="b653-4" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[217,450,1038,129]]]'>it’s reasonable to believe that she’s going to have some very minor, minimum expense in the future years with aspirin and Tylenol.</blockquote>

    <p id="b653-6" data-blocks='[["BL_653.7",653,[136,701,1120,223]]]'>He told the jury that “all the trouble and the inconvenience” was not a factor in determining damages, but that “pain and suffering and disability and past medical expenses” were. He said, “I don’t think $200,000 is too much for the injuries that she has suffered, and her pain and suffering, and her disability.”</p>
    <p id="b653-7" data-blocks='[["BL_653.8",653,[180,929,1038,40]]]'>The jury returned the verdict form for Paul. It read in part:</p>

    <p id="b653-10" data-blocks='[["BL_653.11",653,[139,1200,1122,222]]]'>The two figures were filled in by the jury. The jury further found that Paul’s negligence was forty percent of the cause of her injury and Imperial’s was sixty percent. Thus, Imperial was liable for $2,906.86 in past medical expenses and $51,000.00 in general damages.</p>
    <p id="b653-11" data-blocks='[["BL_653.12",653,[141,1427,1123,397]]]'>After the trial, Imperial moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. It argued that the statements of the hotel employees were erroneously admitted, that McCloud’s lay opinion on the cause of the fall was improper, that the jury instruction on damages was improper, and that the jury disregarded its instructions. The district court granted the motion for a new trial without specifying its reasons. The civil court minutes indicate that the order was “based upon the improper jury instruction 17a.”</p>

Appellant’s' testimony was “not competent to allow damages for future pain and suffering. Where, as here, the disability is subjective in character (headaches, etc.) and not demonstrable to others, expert testimony that the disability will probably continue is needed before an award for future damage is permissible.” <em>Gutierrez, </em><a href="/nev/80/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="80 Nev. 562" data-case-ids="4938920" data-case-paths="/nev/80/0562-01">80 Nev. at 565-66</a>, <a href="/nev/80/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="80 Nev. 562" data-case-ids="4938920" data-case-paths="/nev/80/0562-01">397 P.2d at 4</a> (citation omitted). Had the appellant’s “disability been readily observable by the jurors, objective in nature rather than subjective, an award for future pain and suffering might have been permitted without supporting medical opinion evidence.” <em><a href="/nev/80/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="80 Nev. 562" data-case-ids="4938920" data-case-paths="/nev/80/0562-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/nev/80/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="80 Nev. 562" data-case-ids="4938920" data-case-paths="/nev/80/0562-01">at 566</a>, <a href="/nev/80/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="80 Nev. 562" data-case-ids="4938920" data-case-paths="/nev/80/0562-01">397 P.2d at 5</a>. <em>Lerner </em>was a false imprisonment case where the appellant sought damages for future pain and suffering. The court again stated that in cases involving “subjective physical injury, ... the claim must be substantially supported by expert testimony to the effect that future pain and suffering is a probable consequence rather than a mere possibility.” <em>Lerner, </em><a href="/nev/83/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="83 Nev. 75" data-case-ids="4899410" data-case-paths="/nev/83/0075-01">83 Nev. at 79-80</a>, <a href="/nev/83/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="83 Nev. 75" data-case-ids="4899410" data-case-paths="/nev/83/0075-01">423 P.2d at 40</a>.</p>
    <p id="b654-7" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[340,1496,1122,400]]]'>Contrary to Imperial’s assertion, Paul’s testimony was not the only evidence of her future pain, suffering, and disability. The doctor testified in his deposition regarding her disability and, to some extent, her pain and suffering, and Paul demonstrated her disability to the jury. Because of this supporting evidence and because Paul’s disability was not “subjective,” <em>Gutierrez </em>and <em>Lerner </em>are distinguishable from this case. Paul provided sufficient evidence of future pain, suffering, and disability to allow the jury to award such damages.</p>
    <p id="b654-8" data-blocks='[["BL_654.7",654,[341,1903,1123,265]]]'>Imperial also claims that Paul agreed not to argue the issue of future damages, but then did so. This is not correct. Imperial actually acknowledged in its opening statement that Paul suffered continuing disability, and it objected only to instructing the jury on future medical expenses and future pain and suffering. Paul never agreed not to argue for future damages for disability.</p>

The court directed Paul not to argue specific figures in regard to future medical expenses and perhaps future pain and suffering. Both concepts came up, and the court did not <a id="p1549" href="#p1549" data-label="1549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1549</a>distinguish them. Regardless of the court’s intentions, it is clear that Paul’s counsel only agreed not to argue a specific figure for any future medical expenses: he specifically agreed to raise only the need to buy aspirin and Tylenol and not to argue that more surgery was contemplated. These are matters of medical expenses, not pain and suffering. In his closing argument, he conformed to that agreement, confining his discussion of future medical expenses to aspirin and Tylenol. He then argued for future damages for pain, suffering, and disability and suggested a figure of $200,000.00. This argument was proper given both the district court’s ruling and the facts presented. Moreover, Imperial did not object to this argument, which suggests that it did not feel that Paul’s counsel had violated the court’s ruling.</p>
