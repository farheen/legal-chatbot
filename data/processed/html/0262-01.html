Following a hearing before a District Justice on October 12, 2005, Seyler was found guilty of two counts for each charge and ordered to pay fines and costs. Seyler then appealed to the trial court which conducted a <em>de novo </em>hearing on April 25, 2006.</p>

The Neighbor, who is also a relative of Seyler, testified that she was familiar with the dogs and knew them to reside at Seyler’s home. The Neighbor further testified that upon calling out to Seyler to ask if she needed help, the dogs ran onto her property and attacked her, biting her in various parts of her body. The Neighbor, stated that she was then transported to the hospital via ambulance and treated for injuries she sustained to her hands and legs.</p>
    <p id="b312-11" data-blocks='[["BL_312.11",312,[995,789,752,1177]]]'>Seyler testified that she was walking the female pit bull and a puppy when the male pit bull jumped out of an open window of her home. Seyler conceded that the two dogs did, in fact, bite the Neighbor but testified that the attack occurred on her property rather than the Neighbor’s. She also stated that the dogs belong to her adult sons, who also reside in Seyler’s home and are registered in her sons’ names. However, Seyler failed to provide any paperwork to this effect at the hearing. One of Seyler’s sons, Brandon Seyler (Son), testified that the female pit bull was registered under his name, yet he also failed to provide any paperwork. Son also indicated that Seyler maintained the paperwork on each of the dogs. Based on the testimony presented, the trial court found Seyler guilty of violating Sections 305 and 502-A of the Dog Law, as well as Section 8 of the Rabies Act.

Specifically, Neighbor testified that the male pit bull has lived at Seyler’s residence for at least three years, while the female has lived there for four or five years. Seyler also admitted that the dogs reside in her home and that she was walking one of the dogs at the time of the attack. Such actions by Seyler bring her within the definition of “owner” in Section 102 of the Dog Law, which by its express terms is broader than a person simply having a property interest in a dog. <em><a href="/a2d/908/0991-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="908 A.2d 991" data-case-ids="8459702" data-case-paths="/a2d/908/0991-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/908/0991-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="908 A.2d 991" data-case-ids="8459702" data-case-paths="/a2d/908/0991-01">at 996</a>.

We also observe that the plain and unambiguous intent of Sections 8 of the Rabies Act and 305 of the Dog Law is that dogs be vaccinated and confined at all times. <em>Lopez. </em>Thus, if the person having the property interest in a dog does not perform that function, then the statutes clearly require one harboring or caring for the dog, here <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>Seyler, to perform it. <em><a href="/a2d/908/0991-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="908 A.2d 991" data-case-ids="8459702" data-case-paths="/a2d/908/0991-01">Id.</a> </em>To declare otherwise would frustrate the basic purpose of the statutes and enable individuals to avoid criminal liability merely by registering their dogs in the names of others.</p>

First, it must be established that the individual is the owner or keeper of the dog, and second, that the dog has committed one of four enumerated acts, one of which is attacking a human being without provocation.

Additionally, significant changes were made to this section of the statute by Section 13 of the Act of December 11, 1996, P.L. 943, No. 151, commonly referred to as the 1996 amendments, which added “specific words such as ‘single incident’ to ensure that where it is clear from one attack that a dog is dangerous, that the ‘owners’ or ‘keepers’ are criminally liable for the summary offense of harboring a dangerous dog.” <em>Commonwealth v.
