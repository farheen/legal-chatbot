The fact that those compositions would also have impact resistance would be an inherent characteristic of the compositions. It is well settled that a patent cannot properly be granted for the discovery of a result which would flow naturally from the teaching of the prior art.

We can find nothing in the record to show a criticality of such ranges over the compositions disclosed in the Humphrey et al. and Schaffel et al. patents, and consider the selection of those ranges to be merely an obvious matter of choice. Likewise we find nothing of patentable significance in method claims 28 and 32. Claims 30 and 31 are drawn to an extruded article and an extruded pipe respectively comprising a composition as set forth in claim 27. However, those claims do not set out any definite structural limitations. We do not consider the recitation of an extruded article or pipe to constitute a feature patentably distinguishable over the prior art.</p>

To support his position the examiner referred to polymer 1 in Table I of appellants’ specification which shows that a copolymer of 85 percent butadiene and 15 percent acrylonitrile (vinyl cyanide) has approximately 25 carbons per solubilizing group. The examiner pointed out that a composition containing 20 parts of a rubbery copolymer and 100 parts of a vinyl chloride polymer corresponds to a composition having a 16% : 83% rubbery copolymer to vinyl chloride polymer ratio and that that composition is encompassed by appellants’ claim 26. Similarly, the examiner stated that appellants had specifically pointed to the disclosed copolymers of 60 percent butadiene and 40 percent methyl isopropenyl ketone to support the “12.5” in appealed claim 27. The record indicates that “12,5” carbon atoms when connected to mol percent is equal to “27.5 mol percent.” The term “27.5 mol percent” is recited in appellants’ claim 43.</p>
