Ashley contends that these remarks were improper prosecutorial comment on the credibility of a witness. We have repeatedly stated it is improper for a prosecuting attorney to assert an opinion concerning the credibility of a witness. <em>See, e.g., Weisbrode, </em><a href="/a2d/653/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="653 A.2d 411" data-case-ids="7867174" data-case-paths="/a2d/653/0411-01">653 A.2d at 415-16</a>.

The central issue, therefore, when a defendant contends that the prosecutor injected personal opinion into closing argument, is whether the challenged comment reflects an improper personal opinion or is an argument fairly based on the evidence. <em>State v. Moontri, </em><a href="/a2d/649/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="649 A.2d 315" data-case-ids="7866802" data-case-paths="/a2d/649/0315-01">649 A.2d 315</a>, 317 (Me.1994) (citing <em>State v.

In this case, although varying in some minor details, each victim’s testimony was strikingly similar to that of the other "with respect to the essential aspects of the assault. Additionally, the prosecutor’s request that the jury assess the credibility of one of the victims in light of her demeanor did not bolster improperly the victim’s credibility but rather merely reminded jurors they could give more weight to the testimony of a witness they perceived as truthful. The prosecutor’s remarks did nothing more than “argue on his analysis of the evidence, for [a] position or conclusion with respect to the matters stated therein.” Me. Bar R. 3.7(e)(2)(v).</p>

At the same time copies of such request shall be furnished to the other parties. The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the juiy. The court, at its election, may instruct the jury before or after argument, or both. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the ground of the objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing and presence of the jury.</blockquote>

They are not meant to suggest that there may not be other, perhaps better, hopefully shorter, ways to address the same issues. It is not good practice to utilize this Manual, or any other form instructions, to try to develop a lengthy jury instruction addressing every possible issue in the case. Considerable discretion must be utilized to assure that the jury focusses on the principal issues before them....</blockquote>
