Officer Carboni asserted that he responded to a noise complaint concerning Licensee on April 16, 2005 originating at 2:58 a.m. As Officer Carboni approached the establishment, a large group of patrons standing in front of the building began to disperse. According to Officer Carboni, he and several other officers stayed in the area for ten minutes to make sure no other crowds gathered. On July 5, 2005, Officer Carboni was dispatched to Brandywine Hospital in reference to an incident that happened inside the club. The victim informed Officer Carboni and his partner that he was assaulted. Officer Carboni stated that the victim explained he was punched several times and choked.

He understood that the bartender took the gun and placed it behind the bar, but the patron later retrieved the gun and left the premises. During Officer Strunk’s investigation, he did not observe any security measures to prevent patrons from entering the premises with weapons.

Mr. Brown stated that thereafter he acquired shirts with “security” written on them so security personnel would be easily identifiable.

Police reports are admissible in administrative proceedings, as they were recorded pursuant to an official duty, unless they are untrustworthy. D’Ales<em>sandro v. Pennsylvania State Police, </em><a href="/pa/594/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="594 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="3594729" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0500-01">594 Pa. 500</a>, <a href="/pa/594/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="937 A.2d 404" data-case-ids="3594729,8361556" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0500-01,/a2d/937/0404-01">937 A.2d 404</a> (2007). Moreover, hearsay evidence, admitted without objection, will be given its natural probative effect and may support a finding if it is corroborated by any competent evidence of record. <em>Walker v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>27 Pa.Cmwlth. 522, <a href="/citations/?q=367%20A.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="367 A.2d 366">367 A.2d 366</a> (1976). Pursuant to <em>D’Alessandro, </em>absent any notion that the reports are untrustworthy, these police reports are admissible. Even absent <em>D'Alessan-dro, Walker </em>appears to be equally applicable here to establish the police reports were admissible and could be considered by the Board. This is because the Board presented four police officers who testified concerning their observations of the events that occurred on April 16, 2005, May 22, 2005, July 5, 2005, May 7, 2006, and November 4, 2006. Their observations corroborate much of the pertinent information in the police reports. Thus, if necessary, the police reports could be used to support the Board’s findings of fact.</p>

      <p id="b678-10" data-blocks='[["BL_678.10",678,[996,1850,749,837]]]'>. This Court recognizes that both <em>TLK </em>and <em>Rosing </em>speak of a pattern of illicit conduct when referencing activities that took place at a bar or club that put its liquor license in jeopardy. It is questionable whether the events here that required police presence constitute a pattern of illicit activity. Although, it is true that three serious incidents of harm to the general public or potential harm to the general public occurred within a year and a half time-span. Nonetheless, Licensee does not challenge any notion that the incidents including the assault, shooting, and the bringing of a weapon inside the club, qualify as contributing to the manner in which the premises is operated as referenced in Section 407(a.l). Rather, it only contends that the trial court appropriately found that it took affirmative steps to curtail such incidents. Appellee’s brief, p. 14-15.</p>
