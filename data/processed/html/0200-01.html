Weinschenk and RWB contend that the court erred in: (1) finding violations of the UTPA; (2) imposing in-junctive relief; (3) awarding restitution to indirect purchasers; (4) holding Wein-schenk individually liable; and (5) dismissing their counterclaim.

After moving to Maine in the early 1980s, Weinschenk built what he described as “high-end” single-family houses. In the early 1990s, Weinschenk developed a plan to create moderately priced, compact, custom-designed single-family houses. By lowering construction costs, Wein-schenk was able to build houses costing twenty-five to thirty percent less per square foot than the “high-end” houses he had previously built. Weinschenk then formed RWB. With RWB, Weinschenk created several housing developments in the Portland area. Although buyers contracted directly with RWB for the con<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>struction work, all of the original buyers met individually with Weinschenk, and he personally designed the- houses in each development.</p>

Homeowners reported severe leaks from the windows and roofs, bursting pipes, leaking toilets, and cracks in tiles and in the foundation.</p>
    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[210,1015,755,914]]]'>[¶ 4] Complaints from homeowners led the Attorney General to investigate Wein-schenk and RWB’s trade practices. Upon inspection of fifteen houses, the' State’s consulting engineer identified several common defects in the houses. He reported that the stairs did not comply with applicable building codes, the roofs and windows compromised the weather tightness of the houses, and overall, the houses were “poorly built.” The State then commenced an action against Weinschenk and RWB pursuant to the UTPA, 5 M.R.S.A. § 209. RWB and Weinschenk filed a counterclaim alleging that by bringing suit, the State unilaterally abrogated a consent agreement-that Weinschenk had entered into with the Maine Oil and Solid Fuel Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

A number of individuals who owned houses designed by Weinschenk and constructed by RWB testified about problems in their houses. Several of the homeowners who testified at trial were “indirect purchasers,” that is, they were the second or third buyers of the homes rather than the original purchaser. The indirect purchasers did not contract with RWB for construction purposes, nor did they consult with Weinschenk regarding the design of their houses.</p>

The court ordered Wein-schenk and RWB to pay $221,256 in restitution, through the Attorney General, for the benefit of nine of the homeowners. Five of these homeowners were indirect purchasers, and four purchased their homes directly from Weinschenk and RWB. The Superior Court also issued injunctions against Weinschenk and RWB, requiring them to meet a number of requirements before building any residential dwelling in the State. In addition, the court dismissed the counterclaim, finding that the State had not waived - sovereign immunity.</p>

    <p id="b250-8" data-blocks='[["BL_250.10",250,[227,1171,755,925]]]'>[¶ 32] The sole reason asserted by Wein-schenk and RWB on appeal for setting aside the trial court’s award of restitution to the indirect purchasers is their argument that restitution can be awarded only for consumers from whom Weinschenk and RWB directly acquired money or property as a result of an unfair or deceptive trade practice. The Court properly rejects this argument, citing <em>California v. ARC America Corp., </em><a href="/us/490/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="490 U.S. 93" data-case-ids="604867" data-case-paths="/us/490/0093-01">490 U.S. 93</a>, 97, <a href="/us/490/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="490 U.S. 93" data-case-ids="604867" data-case-paths="/us/490/0093-01">109 S.Ct. 1661</a>, <a href="/us/490/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="490 U.S. 93" data-case-ids="604867" data-case-paths="/us/490/0093-01">104 L.Ed.2d 86</a> (1989); and <em>FTC v.

Nonetheless, the Court vacates the restitution awarded to the indirect purchasers, relying on reasons not raised before the trial court and not addressed in the parties’ briefs.</p>

In its written decision, the trial court carefully evaluated the conflicting expert testimony regarding the cost of repairing the defects in each home. The Court concludes, however, that there was no evidence “that the indirect purchasers sustained either a substantial injury or ascertainable loss,” and that they “may have received a discounted price as a result of the indicated defects.”</p>
    <p id="b250-11" data-blocks='[["BL_250.13",250,[1029,552,753,401]]]'>[¶ 34] Neither of the Court’s conclusions are compelled by the record evidence in this case. The Court should instead defer to the trial court’s assessment of the significance of the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn. <em>See Stickney v.

    <p id="b250-12" data-blocks='[["BL_250.14",250,[1028,985,753,714]]]'>[¶ 35] Of even greater concern is the Court’s assignment of error to the absence of “evidence that the indirect purchasers relied on Weinschenk or RWB’s misrepresentations.” The Court does riot cite a single authority to support this newly announced construction of 5 M.R.S.A. § 209 (2002) requiring proof of actual reliance by indirect purchasers. We should refrain from substantially reducing the availability of UTPA remedies for consumers without the benefit of a thorough analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act and its policy objectives.</p>
