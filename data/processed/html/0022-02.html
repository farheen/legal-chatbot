    <p id="b28-21" data-blocks='[["BL_28.29",28,[202,1952,1333,451]]]'>The record indicates that in January, 1988, the plaintiff and the defendant purchased as joint tenants a two-unit residential property in Richmond, Virginia for investment purposes. In June, 1989, the parties decided to sell the property, and a buyer was found in 1990. Apparently because of a disagreement concerning apportionment of equity and obligations, the defendant refused to sign the purchase and sale agreement. In May, 1991, the plaintiff commenced an action for partition in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Although the defendant was properly served, he did not appear. The Virginia action resulted in a sale of the property and, after an accounting of charges and expenses against the sale proceeds, the entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant in the amount of $10,625.95.</p>
    <p id="b28-22" data-blocks='[["BL_28.30",28,[201,2409,1332,121]],["BL_29.1",29,[127,239,1324,37]]]'>In January, 1993, the plaintiff commenced this action to enforce the Virginia judgment. After trial, a judgment in favor of the plaintiff was entered in this action and the defendant now appeals. We emphasize that the judgment in the present <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>action was entered following a trial and not upon a motion for summary judgment.</p>
    <p id="b29-3" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[126,285,1334,620]]]'>The defendant testified during the trial of this action that although he had not been adjudicated incompetent during the pendency of the Virginia case, he was unable at that time to manage his affairs and did not understand the consequences of the Virginia action. The defendant introduced medical records tending to show that in February, 1987, he sustained serious closed head injuries in a motor vehicle accident which resulted in memory loss, disorganization, short attention span, major depression, suicidal tendencies and other cognitive problems. In September, 1989, the defendant was involuntarily admitted to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Brighton, Massachusetts for approximately two weeks of treatment for those symptoms. From September, 1989 through May, 1990, the defendant was treated by various physicians for these same symptoms. It was the opinion of one of these physicians, as set forth in a medical report introduced without objection at trial, that as of December, 1989, the defendant’s loss of mental function had contributed to the failure of his two businesses and his marriage and that there was little likelihood of improvement in the defendant’s mental functions.</p>
    <p id="b29-4" data-blocks='[["BL_29.5",29,[127,915,1332,453]]]'>Relying on other evidence, however, the trial judge specifically found that between 1987 and the trial of this action in May, 1994, the defendant continued his part-time employment as Executive Director of the Pepperell (Massachusetts) Housing Authority, was involved in the operation of both a building cleaning business and a travel agency and accepted service of divorce papers, notarized by his Massachusetts attorney. Further, in a 1990 suit commenced by the plaintiff in the Middlesex Superior Court prior to the Virginia partition action, the defendant raised no allegation of incompetency in either his attorney’s answer to the plaintiff’s complaint or in his own detailed affidavit concerning the Virginia real estate transaction. Finally, the defendant did not allege present incompetency in his March, 1993 answer to the complaint in this action.</p>

The first question presented is whether the defendant may raise in Massachusetts a claim that he was incompetent at the time of service and other proceedings which culminated in an otherwise valid foreign judgment.
