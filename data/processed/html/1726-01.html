    <p id="b1051-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1051.7",1051,[175,486,1329,145]]]'>This appeal is from the decision of the Board of Patent Interferences awarding priority of invention in interference No. 91,305 to Dorsey and Strashun, the junior party.</p>
    <p id="b1051-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1051.8",1051,[171,638,1329,1006]]]'>The invention relates to a continuous process for dehydrating liquid or semi-liquid concentrates of juices, for example, orange or other citrus juices, at high temperature under sub-atmospheric pressure. The process involves forming a thin film or web of concentrate on the surface of an endless metal belt which travels over and between a heated drum and a cold drum in an evacuated phamber. The web is preheated in increments from its point of application to the belt until it reaches the heated drum, such preheating being provided by radiant heaters distributed along its path of travel. Pleat is also applied to the other side of the web after it passes over the heated drum by additional spaced radiant heating elements. The radiant heat, together with the sub-atmospheric pressure, causes vaporization of the liquid phase of the concentrate. The temperature of the radiant heating elements is maintained sufficiently high to cause puffing of the web and the temperature of the web is raised to a point where the puffed product begins to soften prior to collapse of the puffed structure. That point is called the “pseudo melting point.” The web has the desired moisture <em>content and </em>is in puffed condition when it leaves the last radiant heater. Immediate cooling by the cold drum maintains the puffed condition.</p>

They were copied verbatim in Strashun and Talburt application serial No. 370,239, filed July 24, 1953, and assigned to the United States of America as represented by the Secretary of Agriculture. Thus Dorsey and Strashun are the junior party with the burden of proving priority by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>

In March of 1953 he was an employee of the Department of Agriculture working on the problem of dehydrating citrus juice products, particularly orange juice concentrates. Dorsey was an employee of Vacu-Dry Company which was also concerned with the same problem. Dorsey visited Chain Belt Company in Milwaukee from March 9 through 18 of 1953, utilizing equipment there for experiments of dehydration of orange juice concentrates. Strashun arrived at the Chain Belt Company on March 16, 1953, for the purpose of conducting tests of a continuous process for dehydrating orange juice and remained there until April 1, 1953. He observed some of Dorsey’s tests on March 16 to 18 before carrying out his own tests thereafter.</p>

On April 29, 1953, before leaving the Department, Strashun signed the Strashun and Talburt application in interference.

A notebook in which Doz’sey kept zzotes on his experiments at Chain Belt from March 9 through 18 of 1953 is in evidence as Dorsey and Strashun Exhibit 2. A notebook with data on the tests made by Strashun in March of 1953 constitutes Strashun and Talburt Exhibit A, while certain charts pertaining to those tests are Exhibits A-l and B-l.</p>

A second member, in a specially concurring opinion, agreed “completely” with the first opinion but added comments on the applicability of Rule 258 of the Rules of Practice of the Patent Office. In a third opinion, the remaining board member dissented.</p>

Thus, our view is consistent with the position taken by the party Dorsey and Strashun in relying on the filing date of their application for the involved * * * patent for both conception and actual reduction to practice. Moreover, there is a substantial mass of evidence revealed tending to show that, contrary to the presumption of joint inventorship of the invention in issue w-hich is relied upon by the assignee of the senior party, Strashun and Talburt are not in fact joint inventors of the <em>invention in issue </em>though their joint inventorship of the matter <em>disclosed </em>in the joint application is not questioned.</blockquote>

The rise in temperature is apparently manually controlled with respect to visual tests and the progressively rising temperature is maintained at a point where the puffed product begins to soften <em>prior </em>to collapse. Since the drying occurs very rapidly, apparently in less than two-minutes <em>* * * </em>and the operator must rely upon his sight and judgment to determine the point where the highly * * * puffed product begins to soften, we consider operation in the highly puffed state to be indistinguishable to the observer from operation at the softening point prior to collapse. Operation in highly expanded condition, argued and disclosed by appellants to be critical for appellant’s dehydration, is in our opinion within the patent disclosure of a temperature at the pseudo-melting point. This holding is further strengthened by the-statement in * * * the patent, that the web, as it leaves the last radiant heater, still has its pwjjfed constitution. In our opinion, therefore, appellants’ disclosure, wherein the web has applied to it sufficient heat to maintain it in a greatly expanded condition, short of the temperature of collapse, throughout the very short dehydrating period supports the critical limitation in the claim <em>as to </em>supplying heat so as to maintain the web at the pseudo-melting point and therefore we will not sustain the examiner’s rejection.</blockquote>
