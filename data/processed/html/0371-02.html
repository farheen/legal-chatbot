    <p id="b410-14" data-blocks='[["BL_410.14",410,[250,2247,747,217]]]'>The question on this appeal is whether the trial court improperly overruled defendant’s motion for a continuance which was based on her illness and that of her husband.</p>
    <p id="b410-15" data-blocks='[["BL_410.15",410,[253,2485,752,221]],["BL_410.16",410,[1036,259,748,1179]]]'>The action was one to recover $2,800 for commissions allegedly due for the sale of certain plumbing equipment. Defendant had filed an answer disputing the claim and the assignment commissioner placed' the case on the daily trial calendar on. May 25, 1948. On that day the case was continued to June 15 at defendant’s request, because of the absence of an important witness. On June 15 defendant’s counsel presented a statement from her physician to the effect that she was confined at a local hospital for medical observation and would be unable to attend a trial “for several weeks.” The ease was then continued until July 19. The record recites that it was the understanding of plaintiffs’ counsel “that if the defendant was not sufficiently recovered by July 19, 1948, counsel for defendant would <em>produce </em>a sworn medical affidavit and would notify plaintiffs’ counsel in sufficient time,” but that it was the understanding of defendant’s counsel “that advance notice would be furnished, supported by a medical statement” with no mention of a requirement that such statement be under oath. ' The record does not recite which of these two versions was correct or even whether the discussion concerning the matter was in open court or elsewhere.</p>
    <p id="b410-17" data-blocks='[["BL_410.17",410,[1032,1463,748,1233]]]'>Not less than five days (defendant says it was seven days) before July 19th defendant’s counsel notified plaintiffs’ counsel that he would be unable to go to trial on the 19th because defendant was seriously ill and also because her husband was critically ill in a hospital. On July 16 defendant filed a formal motion asking that the case be continued to a date not earlier than August 13. The motion recited that because of defendant’s illness the continuance to July 19 was a tentative one, conditioned on defendant’s recovery and ability to appear in court. The motion was accompanied by a physician’s certificate which recited: “Mrs. Ruby Etty has been a patient under my care for six weeks. She is suffering from an anxiety state complicated by nervous exhaustion and chronic bronchitis. At present she is permitted only limited activity. Her husband is hospitalized with a serious heart ailment — a fact which contributes to her present condition. I should estimate that she could not return to full activity including participation in court proceedings before four weeks from this date.”</p>

      <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>Defendant’s counsel was'prepared'to argue the motion the day- after it was filed, but it was not reached for hearing until July 19th. Counsel for plaintiffs argued-that he did not<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> believe the motion was made in good faith (this we will discuss later) and that it was his understanding that any such motion was to be supported by an affidavit from the doctor. Counsel for defendant said he. had no recollection -of such an understanding, that the doctor’s certificate established defendant’s illness and the critical illness of her husband, and that he, defendant’s counsel had complied with the previous understanding to notify his opponent in advance, and also that no evidence had been presented to disprove the facts relied bn as grounds for continuance. He also told the court that defendant who had filed a sworn answer to the complaint had a meritorious defense 'to the action. The judge who heard the motion overruled it and ordered that the case proceed to trial later that same day. It was assigned to another judge who heard the testimony 'of the two plaintiffs and,. there being no testimony for defendant, -ordered judgment for plaintiffs for $2,800. This appeal followed..</p>

We recognize the general rule that -action on a motion for continuance rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and is generally not the subject of reversal except when an abuse of discretion is shown.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> But we also are mindful ■of the rule that in acting on a motion for a continuance the judge’s discretion must not be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously but in accordance with fixed legal' principles and with a view to promoting substantial justice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “It is also well established that it is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits wherever possible, so that any doubts which may exist should be resolved' in fayor of the application, to the end of securing a trial upon the merits.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

One of the most important rights of a party litigant — the right to be present at the trial of her ’ case — was taken from her, and what followed was not a trial on the mer-’ its but really little else than an ex parte hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> And it was ex parte because defendant, despite her own illness and the more critical illness of her husband, was denied an opportunity • to come into' court, confront her accusers, and tell her side of the story.'

But there is nothing to indicate that the motions judge based his ruling on such defect, if defect it was. Undoubtedly it is more satisfactory and safer too to support such motions by affidavits,, but that is not required in this jurisdiction either <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>by statute or rule of court. Presumably if the judge had demanded such an affidavit defense counsel could have furnished it. Plaintiffs’ counsel, it is true, said that it was his understanding that if defendant’s illness continued she was to furnish an affidavit to that effect but the recollection of defendant’s attorney was to the contrary. This misunderstanding (undoubtedly a mutually honest one) between reputable attorneys should, it seems to us, have helped guide the judge in the exercise of his discretion in the opposite direction from that which he took. For despite the misunderstanding between counsel the allegation of illness was still uncontradicted on the record — uncontra-dicted, that is, by any evidence for plaintiffs, but only by unsworn statements of their counsel. It is true that plaintiffs’ attorney did challenge the good faith of defendant. This challenge seems to have been based on the fact that plaintiffs’ attorney had six days after the previous continuance telephoned the hospital where defendant had been and was told that she had left. Counsel apparently considered that this cast doubt on the doctor’s statement, submitted in support of that earlier continuance, which counsel said purported to show that defendant would be in the hospital for several weeks. As a matter of fact the statement said no such thing. It said “that defendant was confined for medical observation at the Homeopathic Hospital, and would be unable to go to trial for several weeks.”</p>
