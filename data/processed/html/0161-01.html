Gensheimer appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court (Sagadahoc County, <em>Crowley, J.) </em>affirming the decision of the Town of Phippsburg Zoning Board of Appeals which in turn upheld the decision of the Town Planning Board denying their request to maintain an existing roadbed as an alternate means of accessing their home. The Gensheimers contend that the Board of Appeals and the Planning Board committed various errors in the way they interpreted and applied the Shoreland Zoning Ordinance, and that their factual findings are not supported by the evidence. We agree in part with the Gensheimers and vacate the decision of the Superior Court and remand to the Board of Appeals with instructions to remand to the Planning Board for further proceedings before that Board.</p>

The Gensheimers argued that the subdivision road already in use to access their property was poorly designed, had steep grades, sharp curves, and poor visibility, and was therefore very dangerous. Following a hearing conducted in September of 2002, the Planning Board denied the Gensheimers’ application, stating as its rationale: “Sec. 14.26 in Table of Land Uses — an alternative access presently exists. Subdivision was approved with only one subdivision road.”</p>

The Shoreland Zoning Ordinance contains a table listing the various types of land use activities and whether or not they are permitted in each of the Town districts. Phippsburg, Me., Shoreland Zoning Ordinance § 14, (June 5,1993). The parties do not dispute that the Gensheimers’ property, including their home and the roadbed they seek to use as a road, are located in the RP, or Resource Protection, District. The Land Use Table indicates that “road and driveway construction” in the RP District is prohibited “[e]xcept to provide access to permitted uses within the district, <em>or </em>where no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the RP area, in which case a permit is required from the Planning Board.” Phippsburg, Me., Shoreland Zoning Ordinance § 14.26 &amp; n. 7 (June 5, 1993) (emphasis added). Similarly, the portion of the Ordinance dedicated to roads and driveways states:</p>
    <blockquote id="Ac4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[174,1464,712,603]]]'>New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection District except to provide access to permitted uses within the district, <em>or </em>as approved by the Planning Board upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the district, in which case the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.</blockquote>

    <p id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.8",207,[935,378,752,1068]]]'>[¶ 21] The Gensheimers contend that the Board erred in its interpretation of the Ordinance. Specifically, the Gensheimers argue that the plain language of sections 14.26 and 15(H)(3) indicate that an inquiry into whether a reasonable alternative access exists is necessary only when the roadway is requested to provide access to a non-permitted use. Pursuant to the Ordinance, the Gensheimers contend, a new roadway is allowed- in the RP District <em>either </em>when the property to be accessed is a permitted use, <em>or </em>when no reasonable alternative means of access exists. Because their property is a permitted use, they contend, the Board should have granted their permit to build the new road. The Town contends that “ ‘or’ must be read as ‘and’ to effectuate the purposes and objectives of the ordinance” to limit development in the RP District.</p>

Hence, language in a clause following a disjunctive is considered inapplicable to the subject matter of the preceding clause.” <em>Bureau of Employee Relations v. Me.

This general rule of disjunctives applies to the Ordinance provisions in this case.

The same requirements are listed in the same manner in two independent sections of the Ordinance, sections 14.26 and 15(H)(3).</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[217,812,754,812]]]'>[¶ 23] We agree with the Gen-sheimers that the plain language of sections 14.26 and 15(H)(3) of the Ordinance provide that a permit is required to construct a roadway only when there is no reasonable alternative access to a non-permitted use, and that no permit is required to construct such a roadway when the applicant’s use is a permitted use, regardless of whether there is a reasonable alternative. Thus, the Gensheimers are entitled to create a new road to access their property without a permit if their home is a permitted use, or with a permit if no reasonable means of access exists for their home.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[216,1670,755,871]]]'>[¶ 24] The Board’s determination that the subdivision road did provide the Gensheimers with a reasonable means of accessing their property is a factual finding entitled to deference. Record evidence exists to support that finding, and, contrary to the Gensheimers’ contentions, the Board was not compelled to find that the subdivision road was an unreasonable means of accessing the Gensheimers’ property. <em>See Perrin, </em><a href="/a2d/591/0861-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="591 A.2d 861" data-case-ids="7378597" data-case-paths="/a2d/591/0861-01">591 A.2d at 863</a>.
