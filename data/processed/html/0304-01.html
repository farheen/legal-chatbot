Contending that the educational achievement of minority students is irrelevant to this case, the School District erroneously states that this Court did not require the School District to implement educational goals nor to eliminate any disparities in educational achievement. Hence, because the Commission and Interve-nors failed to “tie in” achievement with desegregation, they have failed to sustain their burden of proving a relationship between educational achievement and desegregation or stated another way, that desegregated schools tend to have higher test scores than racially isolated minority schools or that poor achievement of minority students is in any way connected to the issue of desegregation.</p>
    <p id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.7",368,[985,529,750,1082]]]'>The Court heard extensive testimony in this case, and it is quite evident from the voluminous record that the School District is not entitled to a directed verdict. The Commission has steadfastly maintained that the School District has failed to comply with the orders to desegregate its schools or to correspondingly satisfy the terms of its 1983 modified plan which was formulated to improve racial imbalance in the schools and to provide educational opportunities for minority students. As will be developed later, the Court is of the opinion that the record supports in substantial part, the positions advanced by the parties against whom the motion for directed verdict is made. Moreover, the Court categorically rejects the School District’s assertion that disparities in educational achievement are irrelevant. To the contrary, disparities in educational achievement of students within the School District is one of the paramount and most fundamental issues presented in this case.</p>

The defendant school district’s position that the constitution requires only legislation which makes education free and that the court may not inquire into the educational content of its students runs parallel to the position taken by the School District here. The court denied summary judgment relief and appropriately responded that constitutionally mandated educational opportunity was not limited to expenditures per pupil but was also a requirement for a specific substantive level of education. <em>See also Abbott v.

The first of these initiatives contained four stated goals which were to assure equal educational opportunity and equal access to excellence for all students within the School District regardless of the school attended; to provide educational offerings and specialized programs intended to attract a diverse student applicant pool; to reorganize educational offerings and effect a measurable improvement in student performance at the designated Priority One educational improvement schools; and to respond to the unique educational concerns of those students attending racially isolated schools. The School District recognized that to achieve excellence within the schools, there was a need for each school to have clearly defined learning goals and guidelines for instruction and that high achievement expectations must prevail with emphasis on accepting responsibility for learning by staff and students.</p>

Dr. Clayton indicated that the oldest school facilities in the District, some constructed more than 100 years ago and requiring the greatest amount of repair, are concentrated predominantly in minority areas containing racially isolated minority schools; that upon commencement of her tenure, she found schools not painted in over twenty-five years and generally poor maintenance conditions; and that security and school safety conditions are worse in the racially isolated minority schools.

Because of this fact, Dr. Madden opined that there is something in the environment of these schools which results in their lower achievement levels.

The Court however found Dr. Madden’s testimony to be more persuasive as her studies included more current data, included test scores for both reading and math as opposed to restricting the study to reading as Dr. Yancey did, and did not include controls such as attendance or busing which admittedly the School District can effect. Dr. Yancey controlled for attendance in spite of his testimony that students attending racially isolated minority schools have the highest percentage of attendance in the city.

In finding that the principal factor found to be of paramount importance was the disparity in achievement levels between majority and minority students as measured by standardized test scores, the court concluded that where evidence demonstrates that children are not learning at acceptable levels, “all else pales in significance.” <em><a href="/f-supp/833/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="833 F.

The Commission and Intervenor ASPIRA have argued that the burden of proof in this matter is on the School District to prove its compliance with the court's order. The Court however ruled previously that the Commission and Intervenors had the burden in this enforcement proceeding to demonstrate that the School District has failed to further desegregate its schools in accordance with the 1983 Modified Plan because the Commission agreed to implementation of the plan, to evaluate the District's progress under the plan, and to thereafter determine whether to proceed with enforcement of this Court's April 15, 1982 desegregation order.</p>

In the dissenting opinion in <em>Dowell, </em>Justice Thurgood Marshall commented upon the school board's actions and its intransigence in developing a meaningful plan to remedy discrimination and remarked that "[b]ecause of the relative indifference of school boards toward all-Afro-American schools, many of these schools continue to suffer from high student-faculty ratios, lower quality teachers, inferior facilities and physical conditions, and lower quality course offerings and extracurricular programs.” <em><a href="/f-supp/833/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="833 F.

Dr. Hodgkinson recounted the results of a study conducted of Head Start children, now twenty-three years of age, which showed that those children at age twenty-one compared to the control group at the same age in terms of employment, high school graduation, college, and arrest records, have a greater percentage of success in life. Because the average cost is $20,000 per year to maintain a prisoner, while the School District spent $5,783 per pupil for 1992-93 ex<a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>pected to decline to $5,317 for the current year, and studies show that 72 percent of America's prisoners are high school dropouts, Dr. Hodgkin-son cautions that school districts must place the necessary resources at an early age to prevent future problems to students and society caused by a lack of education.</p>

Dr. Hodgkinson recalled a Milwaukee study of teacher expectations which demonstrated a definite correlation between expectations and student achievement. Teachers predicted that certain children in their classes would end up in jail, and because of those expectations teachers would make sure that this eventuality occurred by ignoring those students in class and not valuing their participation. Another example of the impact of teacher expectations was described by him and Dr. Yancey concerning an important study where teachers were given random and false test scores for their students. Certain of these students who reportedly tested high on intelligence turned out much improved performance because of the teachers' new image of the students and greater attention paid to them which reinforced classroom learning.</p>

In his dissent in <em>Dowell, </em>Justice Marshall stated his agreement with the majority that the proper standard for determining whether a school desegregation decree should be dissolved is whether purposes of the desegregation litigation have been fully achieved but expressed concern over the majority’s failure to directly confront the possibility of a re-emergence of racially identifiable schools, stating that <em>Swann </em>establishes that if further desegregation is reasonable, feasible and workable, then it must be undertaken.
