    <p id="b723-4" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[85,656,1325,244]]]'>The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding, and we are in agreement therewith, that the language of the count in issue is not ambiguous; that the count is broadly worded and should be broadly construed; and that limitations not found in the count should not be read into it for the purpose of avoiding the interference.</p>
    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.5",723,[85,907,1325,295]]]'>With regard to the issue of whether appellee’s application discloses “a sleeve of independent needles between each of said cups and trunnions,” appellant points out that in his disclosure the “needles” are “free of attachment to the cup”; whereas appellee provides a sleeve with an inwardly extending flange which serves to retain the rollers against displacement.</p>
    <p id="b723-6" data-blocks='[["BL_723.6",723,[84,1208,1325,344]]]'>The difficulty with that argument is that the count does not contain the limitation that the needles or rollers are “free of attachment to the cup.” It may be observed in this connection that appellant’s patent in which the involved count originated contains six claims which contain the limitation that the needles are free of attachment to the cup; whereas the involved count, which is claim 1 of the patent, does not contain any such limitation.</p>
    <p id="b723-7" data-blocks='[["BL_723.7",723,[127,1559,939,43]]]'>Kelative to that issue, the Board of Appeals said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b723-8" data-blocks='[["BL_723.8",723,[79,1628,1330,575]]]'>In both structures the rollers oí the bearings are not enclosed in or held in place by a cage as is common in older structures. In both cases the rollers may be said to be independent of each other in that there is no restraining cage. Since these rollers are interposed between the trunnion and the bearing, they bear a certain relation to the bearing in that they are supported thereby, but in other respects they may be regarded as independent since they may have a limited longitudinal movement and are free to roll independent of each of the other elements of the bearing. The party Padgett contends that the count of the interference which was taken from his patent was at one time regarded by the Primary Examiner as not reading on the Warner disclosure and calls attention to arguments presented in the patented file before said count was allowed. There is nothing indefinite or ambiguous about the terms “independent needles” and it is not seen how any argument offered in connection with same can be said to modify the plain and obvious meaning of said terms.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b724-6" data-blocks='[["BL_724.6",724,[233,1001,1146,32]]]'>the cups can only be removed by separating the torque ring sections.</blockquote>

The count in issue, however, is not limited to appellant’s type of structure, and the language of the count here under consideration, although aptly defining appellant’s structure, was held by the Primary Examiner and the Board of Appeals to be sufficiently broad to read upon appellee’s device.</p>
    <p id="b724-9" data-blocks='[["BL_724.9",724,[228,1624,1325,334]]]'>We have given careful consideration to the arguments presented here by counsel for appellant, but are unable to hold that the tribunals of the Patent Office were manifestly wrong in holding that the cups disclosed in appellee’s drawings have end portions which project inwardly from the openings in the “gimbal ring” and extend into the channels and engage the packing, as called for by the count in issue.</p>
    <p id="b724-10" data-blocks='[["BL_724.10",724,[228,1974,1323,244]]]'>Counsel for appellant further contend that appellee’s application does not disclose “retaining means providing abutments to retain the same [the cups] in said openings and maintain the inwardly projecting end portions of the cups against the packings in said channels and with the needles free to move longitudinally in the cups.”</p>

Various other meansi. are shown for holding the cup against outward movement and it is obvious that appellant intended this language to read on certain other structures as well as upon the <a id="p1407" href="#p1407" data-label="1407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1407</a>form showing the split ring. In the Warner structure as stated above, a shoulder is provided on the inner portion of the cup wall and this contacts with the gimbal ring to prevent outward movement of the cup. It is obvious that the terms “retaining means providing abutments” is very broad and obviously was intended to cover any means for performing this function. There is no limitation as to where the retaining means is located or the nature of the abutment used. While it is true appellant shows a slightly greater space for endwise movement of the needles than is disclosed in the Warner structure, still it is clearly shown on the drawings of the Warner device that the needles can have an appreciable endwise movement.</blockquote>
    <p id="b725-4" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[81,706,1325,386]]]'>Counsel for appellant contend that, although the drawings in appellee’s application show a “slight clearance between the roller ends that would apparently permit a slight longitudinal movement of the rollers in the cups,” the application makes no reference to such longitudinal movement of the rollers and no function is claimed therefor, and that, therefore, appellee’s application does not fairly disclose that functional arrangement as called for by the count in issue.</p>
