After considering the parties’ submitted memo-randa,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> we are satisfied that cause has not <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time.

    <p id="b682-4" data-blocks='[["BL_682.5",682,[194,513,757,1673]]]'>On January 6, 2006, Silvia filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court alleging that the defendant police officers used excessive force when arresting her on or about January 17, 2003. She also asserted that this arrest was illegal and that the Town of Warren maliciously prosecuted her for assault and resisting arrest. Additionally in her complaint, Silvia alleged that she was assaulted by a Warren police officer on July 25, 2005. The defendants responded by denying the allegations, asserting affirmative defenses, propounding interrogatories to Silvia, and requesting the production of certain documents. On July 18, 2007, after more than seven months had passed without a reply to their discovery requests, defendants moved to compel Silvia’s response within thirty days. Their motion was granted without objection on October 12, 2007. By July 8, 2008, Silvia still had neither responded to the interrogatories nor produced any documents. Accordingly, defendants moved for a conditional order of dismissal, which was granted on August 27, 2008. On February 24, 2009, the case was transferred from Providence County to Kent County to ensure a speedier trial. After several continuances, the matter was assigned for a “date certain” trial on April 28, 2009.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b682-10" data-blocks='[["BL_682.9",682,[993,271,757,1741]]]'>On this trial date, Silvia’s counsel informed the trial justice that his client would not be present and that she had steadfastly refused to sign her responses to the interrogatories because, as she told him, she “ha[s] [her] mental issues.” On defendants’ motion, and after Silvia’s counsel expressed frustration at his client’s refusal to come to court, the trial justice dismissed the case based on Rule 41(b)(2). The order granting judgment for defendants was entered on April 30, 2009. As the trial justice did not note otherwise, the dismissal “operate [d] as an adjudication upon the merits.” Rule 41(b)(3). Silvia timely appealed to this Court <em>pro se </em>on May 18, 2009, but failed to adhere to other rules of appellate procedure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On June 1, 2009, Silvia wrote to the trial justice averring that she was never informed of the trial date and stating that she would have attended had she known. However, in her two-paragraph, pre-briefing statement to this Court, Silvia simply alleged the same issues on appeal that she alleged but failed to prosecute at the trial court, with the exception of the malicious prosecution claim, which she did not raise on appeal. In response, defendants point out that the question before this Court is not whether Silvia was subjected to unreasonable force or an illegal arrest but whether the trial justice erred in granting the Rule 41(b)(2) motion to dismiss.</p>

Ultimately, the propriety of the decision to grant a dismissal for failure to prosecute is determined by a balancing test in which “the court is ‘required to weigh conflicting interests.

Notwithstanding her failures to reply, a trial date certain was finally set, yet Silvia still did not comply. In fact, she told her attorney beforehand that she did not plan to attend.

Moreover, given the extent of Silvia’s delay, her apparent lack of concern for the trial court’s orders, and the countervailing diligence of defendants, the balance of equities expounded in <em>Harvey </em>and <em>Bergeron </em>weighed heavily in favor of dismissing the case.
