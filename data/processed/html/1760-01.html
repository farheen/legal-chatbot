Eeppe I, it is stated, specifically excludes phosphorus-containing compounds since it calls for a substituent element having an atomic number greater than that of phosphorus. It is also argued that Eeppe IV “teaches away from the use of compounds containing the phosphorus atom.”</p>

In discussing the prior art, Lauten-schlager states “it is already known to use for this reaction as catalysts complex compounds of nickel which contain besides halogen, <em>phos-</em>phonium, arsonium or stibonium compounds.” [Emphasis ours.] The disclosure of Eeppe I is substantially identical (understandably so since the two were co-workers). The disclosure of Eeppe IV, above quoted, indicates that iron was attempted to be used as “supplementary” to a nickel bromide catalyst, but that such attempts have been “abandoned in favor of the use of organic complex compounds of phosphorus, * * We cannot take as “teaching away,” the statements of Eeppe IV that prior difficulties, specifically stated to be formation of side products and slowness of reaction, “can be avoided without the need to incorporate elements such as phosphorus * * Such a teaching of an alternative or equivalent method does not teach away from the use of solvents with a phosphorus compound. Finally, with regard to the use of phosphorus compounds as a catalyst component, each of the five Dunn and Proops patents, as well as the instant application, states that the prior art catalyzed the reaction “in the presence of a metal carbonyl, or other catalyst, for example, <a id="p1767" href="#p1767" data-label="1767" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1767</a>the complex triphenyl <em>phosphine-mck&amp;l </em>halide compounds * * [Emphasis supplied.]</p>
    <p id="b1091-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1091.4",1091,[218,406,1324,399]]]'>We think the above quoted passages make it abundantly clear that both solvents, specifically N-methylpyrrolidone, and phosphorus-containing compounds as catalyst components, are conventionally used in the specific reaction of the instant process. Both the Dunn and Proops process as claimed and the Beppe I and IV patents are stated by appellants to use excess alcohol, one of the reactants, as a solvent, and the latter patents teach the equivalence of such a solvent with, specifically, N-methy lpyrrolidone.</p>
    <p id="b1091-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1091.5",1091,[222,814,1323,399]]]'>Appellants also contend that the claimed processes produce an unexpected improvement in the total yield as well as a reduction in the amount of <em>polymer, </em>an unwanted side-produce when the <em>monomer </em>form is desired. Appellants rely primarily on a comparison of Example 1 with Example la. Example la is represented to differ from Example 1 by the omission of the N-methylpyrrolidone solvent. Omission of the solvent is stated to result in a reduction in yield from 93% to 20% and a monomer/polymer ratio drop from 7.5/1 to 5/1.</p>
    <p id="b1091-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1091.6",1091,[223,1221,1327,904]]]'>We cannot attach particular significance as showing non-obviousness to those examples since the procedures followed in the two examples do not have such correspondence (not considering the omission of the solvent) that the improved results can be traced, within a reasonable certainty, to the solvent alone. The nickel halide component of the catalysts is not the same in both, being nickel bromide in the solvent-containing example but nickel iodide in the non-solvent (lower yield) example. While the yield was lower even though the more reactive nickel iodide was used to offset the lack of solvent, we note that the reaction temperature was lowered and the time period shortened as well. The amounts of the two catalyst components are not the same in the two examples, and we have no information whether the relative proportions are the same or different. In the non-solvent example 925 grams of ethanol are used, while 230 grams are employed in the solvent-using example. We are not free to speculate whether that difference represents an excess of ethanol reactant to act as a solvent. There is no specific disclosure in the non-solvent example of the pressure nor of the amount of carbon monoxide or acetylene used.</p>

But we do not find such improvements unexpected if, indeed, they are traceable to the solvent, since the secondary references disclose that improvements are to be expected from the use of solvents. Eeppe IY (quoted above) indicates improvements in the reaction, using their particular catalysts, are obtained by the use of solvents. The improvements noted by Eeppe IY are: 1) an increased rate of reaction, which in a given period would be expected to result in a greater product yield, and 2) a reduction of side products, one of which is known to be the polymer form. Additionally, Eeppe I, who uses N-methylpyrrolidone solvent, teaches us a <em>reason </em>for improved results:</p>

What appears omitted from Example 8 is the phosphorus-containing component of the catalyst, and it is thus not related to the issue. Similarly, we find Examples 10-12 are no support for appellants’ position. Those examples show the addition of a phosphorus-containing compound to the catalyst-complex of Eeppe II gives improved results.</p>
