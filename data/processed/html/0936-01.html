James and Jennifer Daugherty are the owners of real property located at 510 Todd Street in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania (Property). In 2002, Allegheny County assessed the Property at $66,900 as a result of its county-wide reassessment that used a prevailing base year market valuation. In January of 2004, the Daughertys purchased the Property for $31,500; in tax year 2006 the Property was assessed at $66,900. On December 14, 2005, the Daughertys appealed the 2006 assessment seeking to have it reduced to $81,500.

It is the taxpayer’s decision which theory to pursue in its assessment appeal, <em>ie., </em>that the assessment exceeds the current market value or the assessment is based upon an incorrect base year market value. Once that valuation is determined in accordance with the appeal it “shall stand as the [valuation] for the [assessment] of all county ... taxes_” Section 10(f) of the Second Class County Assessment Code, 72 P.S. § 5452.10(f). The trial court did not err in declaring Rule TV’s limitation on assessment appeals to be invalid.
