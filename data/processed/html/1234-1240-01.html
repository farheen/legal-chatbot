Restitution was to be quantified “at a later date.” Two months after discharging Moore from probation in an Order reflecting that Moore owed no restitution, the Superior Court ordered specific restitution to parties inconsistent with what Moore had agreed to at sentencing. Several years later, after receiving no post discharge restitution payments consistent with the Order, the court issued a civil judgment against Moore which resulted in the “intercept” of a Delaware State income tax refund. Moore argues that the Superior Court improperly entered the post discharge restitution order and civil judgment. We agree, and reverse.</p>

Based on the record before this Court, that notice was the first time the State made Moore aware of the outstanding civil judgment against him. On March 25, 2009, the State intercepted his 2008 tax refund of $3,449.40 and applied it to his outstanding ordered restitution, as follows: the State paid Seibert the full $488.00 that the Court ordered Moore to pay her, and paid (in part) Moore’s ordered restitution to AAA (his own insurance carrier to which he had paid premiums for the coverage it provided) with the remaining $3,268.00.</p>

In return for Moore’s guilty plea, the State agreed to recommend a sentence of probation, payment of fines, and payment of restitution to the three named individuals riding in the car that Moore struck — specifically, Seibert and the Bensons. While the plea agreement left the amount of restitution an open term to be filled at some indefinite later date by the PSIO, it explicitly listed the parties— indeed, the only parties — to whom the court would make Moore pay restitution as a condition of his agreement with the State to plead guilty. Upon accepting Moore’s plea agreement, the Superior Court had jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The Superior Court did not, however, have the power unilaterally to amend the agreement, without notice and an opportunity to be heard, to force Moore to pay restitution to four new claimants — AAA, The Hartford, DBA Collections, or Dynamic Physical Therapy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

Under these circumstances, a reasonable person could only conclude that any restitution issue had been finally resolved. In <em>Linton, </em>the judge merely held that the statutory scheme, in the absence of judicial conduct to the contrary, “implicitly retain[s the court’s] jurisdiction so that the court could assess the <em>value </em>of the restitution at a later date.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Even assuming that the <a id="p1246" href="#p1246" data-label="1246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1246</a>statutory scheme empowers a court implicitly to retain jurisdiction “without requiring any particular pronouncement” by the <em>court </em>— Linton’s critical statement of law that we assume <em>arguendo </em>without deciding here — the judge in this case affirmatively struck the section of the sentence modification form addressing restitution. In fact, the judge properly did so, because Moore’s auto insurance carrier, AAA, had paid Seibert, and the Bensons filed no loss claim form. That indirect act reasonably demonstrates an intent to discharge Moore from further restitution orders. It also had the effect of precluding the later assertion of jurisdiction to impose restitution without prior notice and a chance to be heard in the ongoing case. If, indeed, as <em>Linton </em>suggests, “the imposition of restitution and probation constitute two separate judgments,” then before restitution can be ordered, the person subject to any order must be given notice and a hearing before a final order of restitution can effectively be entered.</p>

    <p id="b1293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1293.6",1293,[130,1625,753,706]]]'>On the basis of the unique factual circumstances of this case, the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to order Moore to pay restitution after it discharged him from probation. In addition, by failing to provide Moore notice and a hearing before modifying restitution by adding additional claimants and later entering a civil judgment against Moore for the modified restitution, the State violated Moore’s due process rights. The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the restitution order and civil judgment against Moore are vacated.</p>

Even had the plea agreement contemplated restitution to these additional parties, the restitution payor’s own carrier is not a proper beneficiary of restitution payments. Before his accident, Moore paid premiums to AAA for the very coverage they provided. Moreover, insurance companies in the position of The Hartford may pursue civil subrogation claims to recover PIP payments according to 21 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2118(g). They receive premiums to make their coverage available to their insureds. Intercompany arbitration provided The Hartford with a remedy against Moore’s carrier, AAA. To allow insurance companies with a civil remedy to use the criminal justice system to recover would circumvent otherwise applicable statutes of limitation or at the very least make Delaware taxpayers and the State act as their collection agency. We do not believe the General Assembly contemplates the criminal justice system acting as a collection agency for insurance carriers.</p>
