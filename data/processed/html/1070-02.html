Unbeknownst to appellant, the police had placed a court-authorized wiretap on two telephones in the bar where he worked and had secretly recorded his telephone conversations pertaining to the potential sale or trade of controlled substances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In addition, the police had placed a body wire on an informant in order to record several face-to-face drug transactions with the appellant.</p>

After each of the tapes was played for the jury, Trooper Pothoff testified as to the substance of the conversation that the jury had just heard. Additionally, nine of the individuals whose voices were heard on the tape recordings testified that they had listened to the tapes as the tapes were being played for the jury and agreed that it was their voices that had been captured on the tapes. These individuals also testified that they agreed with Trooper Pothoffs trial characterization of the conversations.</p>

In addition, the jury asked for permission to review the fifty-three tape recordings and their corresponding transcripts. The trial judge discussed the jury’s request with both counsel and appellant’s trial counsel objected to the transcripts going out with the jury during its deliberations. The trial judge overruled counsel’s objection and allowed the transcripts to go out with the jury with the following instruction:</p>

      <a id="p1073" href="#p1073" data-label="1073" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1073</a>Here, in light of the meticulous care taken by the trial court to ensure that the jury understood that the transcripts were to be used only as guideposts and not as verbatim translations, we cannot characterize the trial court’s decision to permit the jury to use the transcripts as manifestly unreasonable. <em>Hawkins, supra. </em>It is axiomatic that a trial is a search for the truth. The jury should be assisted, not hindered, in conducting that search. Here, it is plain that the jury was seeking a complete understanding of how the voluminous evidence related to the specific crimes with which appellant was charged. After two hours of deliberation, the jury asked for the name of each person involved with appellant in each count as well as the tapes and transcripts pertaining to those counts. The trial court properly realized that the transcripts could serve as an index to the tapes, assisting the jurors in finding those tapes that they wished to replay and allowing them to more easily correlate which of the seventeen recorded voices they were listening to with the corresponding counts charged against appellant. Not only did the trial court appropriately instruct the jurors that they could review the transcripts for these narrowly circumscribed purposes, but the court also clearly instructed the jury that they, as jurors, were independently responsible for ascertaining the <em>content </em>of the tapes. Under these somewhat daunting factual circumstances, with the jury attempting to match a large number of unfamiliar tape-recorded voices to an even larger number of counts describing disparate incidents of narcotics trafficking, the trial court prudently addressed the situation by permitting the jury to use the transcripts as limited guideposts to the recordings. Far from exhibiting manifest unreasonableness, the trial court’s decision was grounded in common sense and allowed the jury to evaluate and weigh the evidence in an efficient and rehable manner. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>

We cannot discern any policy considerations that militate against the weight of the overwhelming federal precedent on .this subject. Indeed, it would be illogical and unfair to allow jurors to render a verdict on the basis of faulty recollection of evidence instead of the evidence itself. We cannot discern any reason why the jurors should be compelled to rely on their fleeting memories of the evidence when the evidence itself is readily available. In short, sound policy considerations militate in favor of interpreting Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114 so as to allow jurors to view evidence, such as the transcripts herein, with the precautions that were taken by the trial judge.</p>

Therefore, the Rules attempt to limit the opportunity for juries to unduly emphasize individual pieces of evidence. For example, Pa. R.Crim.P. 1113 prohibits jurors from taking notes during the course of trials because they might place undue emphasis and rebanee on their notes, rather than <a id="p1075" href="#p1075" data-label="1075" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1075</a>rely on their collective recollection of the evidence and testimony presented at the trial. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1113; <em>Thornton v.

Similarly, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2) prohibits trial judges from permitting a jury to review transcripts of trial testimony during its deliberations, because of the risk that the jury will place undue emphasis on the testimony set forth in the transcripts and abandon its duty to rely on its collective recollection of the evidence and testimony presented at trial. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2); <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the prejudicial effect of the transcripts in the instant case is not grounded in the failure of the trial court to adequately instruct the jury as to the limited purpose(s) for which it could use them. Rather, the prejudicial effect of the transcripts is grounded in the opportunity for the jury to place undue emphasis on the contents of the transcripts, and in the danger that the availability of the transcripts in its deliberations will prompt the jury to abandon its responsibility to rely on its collective recollection of the evidence and testimony presented during the trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b1121-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1121.8",1121,[940,817,757,846]]]'>Therefore, I agree with Appellant that the procedural safeguards that were present in the instant case did not, and could not, ameliorate the prejudicial effect of the jury’s opportunity to review the transcripts during its deliberations. In addition, I believe that the dangers to the deliberative process that are created when a trial court permits a jury to review transcripts of tape-recorded conversations during its deliberations outweigh any potential probative value that the transcripts may have. Accordingly, I would find that the trial court’s decision to permit the jury to review the transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations during its deliberations was manifestly unreasonable, and therefore constituted an abuse of its discretion.</p>

In my view, the transcripts of the tapes provided to the jury during its deliberations in the instant case were tantamount to transcripts of trial testimony, which juries are never permitted to take with them during their deliberations pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2). In much the same manner as calling individuals to testify at trial, playing the tapes for the jury allowed it to hear Appellant and numerous other individuals relay information concerning the drug transactions which formed the basis of the Commonwealth’s case against Appellant. Therefore, I fail to see an appreciable distinction between permitting a jury to review transcripts of live trial testimony and permitting the jury in the instant case to review the transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations. In addition, I see little difference between permitting the jury to review a defendant's recorded confession during its deliberations, which is prohibited by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2), and permitting the jury to review the transcripts during its deliberations in the instant case. In the taped conversations that were the subject of the transcripts here, Appellant himself discussed multiple potential purchases and sales of illegal drugs. Although the tapes do not technically constitute confessions by Appellant to the crimes with which he was charged, I believe that the potential prejudicial effect of the transcripts is similar, if not identical to the prejudicial effect that would result from the jury having an opportunity to review a defendant’s recorded confession during its deliberations.</p>
