Employer asserts, in essence, that a recipient whose loss of earning power is caused by any period of incarceration rather than a work injury should not, by rights, receive workers’ compensation benefits.</p>

Even thought the statutory language is clear, Employer urges this Court to conclude that there should be no distinction between incarceration <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>conviction.

Employer contends that Claimant voluntarily withdrew from the workforce “by soliciting the murder of his wife.” Employer’s Brief at 7. True, Claimant ultimately pled guilty to this crime. However, it has long been recognized that the right to freedom by bail pending trial is interrelated to the lynchpin of legal doctrine that one accused is presumed innocent until his guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Stack v. Boyle, </em><a href="/us/342/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="342 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="641182" data-case-paths="/us/342/0001-01">342 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/342/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="342 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="641182" data-case-paths="/us/342/0001-01">72 S.Ct. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20L.%20Ed.%203" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="96 L. Ed. 3">96 L.Ed. 3</a> (1951). Because an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, pretrial incarceration is entirely irrelevant to the issue of guilt. A number of criminal trials do end in acquittal. Thus, it does not necessarily mean, as Employer posits, that pretrial incarceration is the equivalent to “voluntarily” removing oneself from the workforce. Moreover, if this Court accepts Employer’s position, an injured employee’s entitlement to benefits prior to conviction would turn on the ability to post bail. As the Supreme Court of South Dakota explained:</p>
    <blockquote id="b666-8" data-blocks='[["BL_666.8",666,[1033,885,715,1227]]]'>A confinement which precludes participation in the labor market is not alone sufficient to deprive a former employee who has suffered a work-related disability of his rights to benefits. To deny a claimant benefits while he is incarcerated awaiting trial is an unfair situation. It favors a defendant who is capable of posting bail over one who is unable to do so. Any rule which has the effect of predicting the right to compensation benefits upon the ability to furnish bail presents a serious question of denial of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The determinative question should be whether or not the claimant, while in jail, could or could not have worked in any event because of his injury. His dependents should not be denied support and the carrier relieved of its obligation when ‘the physical and industrial disability and the loss of wage-earning capacity on which the award was bottomed still continues.’</blockquote>
