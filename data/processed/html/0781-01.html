The pleading was denominated, “Complaint for Damages Abuse of Civil Process,” and charged that appellee, a corporation, wrongfully filed a complaint on January 15, 1953, in the Municpal Court, against appellant and his former wife for the “balance due, on merchandise purchased from [appellee] by defendants.” Appellant alleged'that service ' on him wás made by leaving the suit papérs ' with his formér' wife at' her home' where he never lived.

When appellant attempted to secure credit at various business establishments, he was unsuccessful due to the judgment of record. On November 12, 1955, appellee filed a praecipe in the United States District Court indicating that the judgment was settled and satisfied as to appellant, but did nothing to remove the judgment from the Municipal Court docket. As a result, appellant has been embarrassed and humiliated and has suffered mental anguish and “a complete impairment of his credit.”</p>
