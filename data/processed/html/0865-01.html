Petitioner, Georgetown University Hospital, argues that the award of temporary total disability benefits to Ms. Fiscian, for the period of September 9, 2002, through and including October 2, 2002, and the finding by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that the claimant’s lower-back pain was causally related to a work-related injury are both unsupported by substantial evidence.

On that day, Ms. Fiscian opened a closet door to reach for some sterile linens in a hospital room and was knocked in the forehead by the closet door, which had fallen off its hinges. She sought medical attention for the first time the next day at the emergency room of Georgetown University Hospital, and af-terwards she sought the care of a doctor through her health insurance. She saw her treating physician, Dr. Nancy Rivera-King, six times between July 5 and October 2, 2002.</p>
    <p id="b915-6" data-blocks='[["BL_915.7",915,[164,1695,752,757]]]'>Immediately following the injury, Ms. Fiscian complained of and was treated for a forehead contusion and neck/cervical pain. At her visit to the doctor on August 7, 2002, she also noted lower-back (lumbo-sacral) pain, which Ms. Fiscian stated in her testimony before the ALJ was caused by the physical therapy that had been prescribed by Dr. Rivera-King to alleviate her cervical pain.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Ms. Fiscian was released to return to work on August 12, 2002, but only for a four-hour shift (instead of the regular twelve-hour shift) and with the further limitation that she not lift more than fifteen pounds.</p>

Ms. Sullivan examined Ms. Fiscian and determined that she was able to return to full duty on that day. Ms. Sullivan testified that before commencing the examination, she was aware of the advice given by Ms. Fiscian’s treating physician that claimant should return to work on a limited basis, but that she was responsible under the hospital’s policy for making a separate determination whether the employee was able to return to work.</p>

She did not seek her supervisor’s consent and she was reprimanded by Ms. Philip in a letter dated the following day, August 13, for her failure to complete the full twelve-hour shift. Ms. Philip sent a second letter, dated August 16, 2002, advising Ms. Fiscian that her employment had been terminated effective midnight on August 16, due to her failure to show up for work for three consecutive <a id="p868" href="#p868" data-label="868" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*868</a>days, which under the hospital’s policy constituted a <em>de facto </em>resignation by the employee. Before the ALJ, Ms. Fiscian maintained that if she had been offered an opportunity to work four-hour shifts consistent with the medical advice she received from her treating physician, she would have returned to work after August 12, 2002, but that she received no indication that the hospital was willing to provide her that option, and Ms. Philip had told her that the hospital could not offer her any four-hour shifts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In her testimony, Ms. Philip stated that she would have tried to “accommodate” Ms. Fiscian, but only depending on how Ms. Fiscian was feeling on a given day.

In addition, according to petitioner, the CRB also erred in concluding that even if the presumption did not apply (as the CRB thought), there was substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that Ms. Fiscian’s lower-back pain was caused by the physical therapy prescribed as part of the treatment for the work-related injury she sustained on July 4, 2002.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
