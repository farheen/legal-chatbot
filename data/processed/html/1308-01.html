    <p id="b1366-25" data-blocks='[["BL_1366.23",1366,[992,1488,753,797]]]'>In this action for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress brought by Donna M. Drejza, a rape victim, against Michael J. Vaccaro, the police detective assigned to investigate the rape, the trial judge granted Vaccaro’s motion for summary judgment. The principal question presented on appeal is whether, treating Ms. Drejza’s account of her dealings with Detective Vaccaro as true and drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in her favor, Vaccaro’s conduct while interviewing her shortly after the rape was sufficiently severe and outrageous to entitle Ms. Drejza to a determination by a jury of the question whether she should recover damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>
    <p id="b1366-26" data-blocks='[["BL_1366.24",1366,[990,2324,752,421]],["BL_1367.1",1367,[187,225,752,227]]]'>The trial judge found that, if Ms. Drejza’s account is credited, Vaccaro’s conduct was obnoxious and boorish, but she concluded as a matter of law that it was insufficiently extreme to entitle Ms. Drejza to any relief. On appeal, Ms. Drejza contends that Vacca-ro, who knew that she had been raped and traumatized, and that she was therefore in an especially vulnerable condition, abused his <a id="p1309" href="#p1309" data-label="1309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1309</a>position of authority by deriding, belittling and insulting her, and that under all of the circumstances, Vaccaro’s conduct as described by her was sufficiently outrageous to support her claim.</p>
    <p id="b1367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1367.4",1367,[187,473,754,838]]]'>The issue presented to us is a difficult one. Many of the comments by Detective Vaccaro of which Ms. Drejza complains, standing alone, might reasonably be characterized as legitimate (though ill-timed) inquiries by an officer charged with investigating a case and assessing its strength, or as, at most, imprecise and perhaps ill-advised remarks which were insufficient to support a finding of out-rageousness. An impartial juror might, on the other hand, reasonably view not only as obnoxious, but also as outrageous, some of Detective Vaccaro’s more extreme alleged <em>conduct </em>— e.g., tossing a distraught rape victim’s undergarments at her while telling her to take her “little panties home,” and later joking and snickering about her lack of virginity, as reflected by her “marital hymen.”</p>

Nevertheless, taking the entire tone and flavor of the encounter into consideration, we conclude that in this ease the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Drejza, raises genuine issues of material fact precluding the entry of summary judgment. Specifically, we conclude that the trial judge, in granting summary judgment in favor of Vaccaro, failed to recognize the significance of the most important fact in the case, namely, that Ms. Drejza’s initial interview by a police detective of the “Sex Offense Branch” occurred only an hour or so after she had been raped. An impartial jury could readily conclude that a woman who had been subjected to such a dehumanizing ordeal was far more susceptible to emotional distress than someone in less vulnerable circumstances, and the outra-geousness determination must be made with her special circumstances in mind. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment as to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

    <p id="b1367-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1367.12",1367,[987,677,758,1140]]]'>In the early morning hours of May 16, 1987, Ms. Drejza was assaulted, raped and sodomized in her apartment by Jeffrey D. Smith, a former boyfriend with whom she had terminated a romantic relationship a few months earlier, but with whom she had remained friendly. Although Ms. Drejza voluntarily admitted Smith to her home, the encounter became a violent one. Protesting that Ms. Drejza had “dumped” him, Smith initially requested her to have sex with him. When Ms. Drejza declined his advances, Smith forcibly subdued her. He ripped off her clothes, struck her about the face and back, smashed her face into a pillow, and choked her. Smith forced his penis into Ms. Drejza’s mouth and vagina, and he threatened to hit, kick or kill her if she resisted. At times, Ms. Drejza was unable to breathe. She suffered bruises, swellings, and broken blood vessels around her eyes. Smith’s hands also left marks around her neck, and she had an assortment of other pains and injuries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Uniformed officers arrived on the scene and took her to police headquarters, where her ease was assigned to Detective Vaccaro, then a member of the Metropolitan Police Department’s Sex Offense Branch. Vaccaro interviewed her at some length and, according to Ms. Drejza, ridiculed and bullied her into signing a statement to the effect that she did not wish to press charges. It was Detective Vaccaro’s conduct during the course of this encounter, and at a second meeting twelve <a id="p1310" href="#p1310" data-label="1310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1310</a>days later (when Ms. Drejza returned to press charges), that forms the basis for Ms. Drejza’s claim against Vaccaro.</p>
    <p id="b1368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1368.4",1368,[191,388,755,640]]]'>According to Ms. Drejza’s complaint, on which she elaborated in her deposition, Detective Vaccaro “showed little interest in [her] story or in talcing a detailed statement from her, and instead suggested that she simply forget about the incident.” During the course of the interview, Vaccaro allegedly asked questions and made comments along the lines indicated in the accompanying footnote.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> For the reasons stated below, we do not view most of these statements, standing alone, as constituting tortious conduct supporting recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>

Ms. Drejza testified that Vaccaro acted in an obnoxious manner throughout the interview, snickered at her account, and generally treated her with derision and scorn, apparently because her assailant was someone she knew and because she had had voluntary sexual relations with him in the past. According to Ms. Drejza, Vaccaro was “smiling during the whole thing,” acting “like he enjoyed it.” He had a “smirk on his face when I was telling him about what was going on, like he was enjoying it.” Although she had brought her torn underwear and brassiere to police headquarters with her, as she had been instructed to do, Vaccaro declined to accept them, telling her to “take your little panties home with you” and “just tossing it back at me.” Ms. Drejza then testified as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1368-16" data-blocks='[["BL_1368.17",1368,[1030,388,714,174]]]'>He was just a real jerk about it. I don’t think he should have been smiling during this whole thing, like getting enjoyment from it.</blockquote>

    <p id="b1368-21" data-blocks='[["BL_1368.22",1368,[990,1270,752,371]]]'>Through these and other remarks and actions, Vaccaro made Ms. Drejza “feel guilty about it, like it wasn’t really that bad, or you’re not really worth it.” At the conclusion of the interview, allegedly as a result of the pressure put on her by Detective Vaccaro, Ms. Drejza signed a statement to the effect that she did not wish to prosecute.</p>

Upon learning that Ms. Vaccaro wished to pursue the case, he commented that “you now want to file a report and send that guy to jail for life.” He also joked and snickered at a reference in a medical report <a id="p1311" href="#p1311" data-label="1311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1311</a>to Ms. Drejza’s “marital hymen,” remarking that this “means you are not a virgin.” On this occasion, Ms. Drejza complained to the lieutenant in charge, and another detective was assigned to her case.</p>
    <p id="b1369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1369.4",1369,[188,492,754,706]]]'>Vaccaro also testified on deposition. He stated that, from the beginning of the initial interview, Ms. Drejza stated that she did not wish to press charges, but only wanted Smith to receive psychological treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> He denied attempting to influence her in any way regarding the decision whether or not to prosecute. Although Detective Vaccaro acknowledged that he may have made parts of some of the comments described in footnote 3, <em>supra, </em>he insisted that he was simply posing legitimate inquiries and that the decision at the time of the initial interview not to seek prosecution of Smith was entirely Ms. Drejza’s.</p>

    <p id="b1369-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1369.8",1369,[192,1788,751,323]],["BL_1369.9",1369,[988,238,756,230]]]'>Vaccaro filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against him on the ground that “plaintiff has failed to allege in her pleadings, the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, as a matter of law.” Judge Wolf denied the motion. Vaccaro then filed a motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, adding a number of grounds not material here. With Judge Wolfs agreement, the motion was presented to Judge Long, to whom Judge Wolfs ealen-dar had been assigned.</p>
    <p id="b1369-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1369.11",1369,[989,498,755,367]]]'>In a comprehensive opinion in which she rejected certain other claims raised by Detective Vaccaro,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Judge Long concluded as a matter of law that his conduct was not sufficiently outrageous in character to support an action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge analyzed the issue as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1369-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1369.12",1369,[1027,893,719,517]]]'>Certainly, there are tactful and untactful means of broaching these topics with a person who has freshly arrived from a crime scene. But the law does not afford a cause of action for bad taste, boorishness, condescension, obnoxiousness, or social ineptitude. Even if Vaccaro’s interview technique resulted in all of these things, they are not tantamount to a specific intent[<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>] to create psychological injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1369-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1369.13",1369,[991,1439,754,230]]]'>The judge also noted Ms. Drejza’s claim that, as a rape victim, she was peculiarly susceptible to emotional distress. The judge rejected this contention, however, for the following reasons:</p>

But without any knowledge of any pre-existing, special psychological proclivities or diagnosed problems, there was no reason for Vaccaro to place Ms. Drejza in a category that was different from all other crime victims or all other rape victims. Moreover, the fact <a id="p1312" href="#p1312" data-label="1312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1312</a>that plaintiff was a rape victim, without more, does not conclusively demonstrate that she was <em>ipso facto </em>more mentally unstable than another person who has been involved in a violent event.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1370.4",1370,[186,477,754,279]]]'>The judge thus apparently took the position that if a rape victim has been traumatized as a result of her ordeal, this is of little or no legal consequence unless she has been <em>more </em>traumatized than other women who have been subjected to a similar experience.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Evidence in this record tends to show that an experienced detective in the Sex Offense Branch humiliated a distraught rape victim, ridiculed her complaint, and treated her with derision. According to Ms. Drejza, Vaccaro repeatedly smirked at her account, acted as though her ordeal was insignificant and her complaints were unreasonable, bullied her into (initially) not pressing charges, and tossed her “little panties” at her, directing her to take them home with her. When she summoned up the courage to return to police headquarters twelve days later to charge her assailant with rape, Vaccaro allegedly mocked her because her “marital hymen” proved that she was not a virgin. Such alleged conduct, directed at a woman whose world has just been turned upside down as a result of a shattering and dehumanizing experience, was not merely obnoxious and insensitive. It was also extreme and outrageous. At least, an impartial trier of fact could reasonably so find.</p>

Such an inquiry could be conducted at a later date, preferably by a prosecutor, after the victim had been given a reasonable amount of time to regain control over her emotions and faculties. After all, Ms. Drejza was at the police station in the immediate aftermath of her rape to ensure that the matter would be carefully investigated.

By the time of the second interview, Ms. Drej-za’s situation was perhaps not quite as poignant as it has been in the immediate aftermath of the rape, but an impartial jury could reasonably find that she nevertheless remained extremely vulnerable, particularly if Detective Vaccaro’s approach rekindled the allegedly humiliating atmosphere of the initial interview.</p>

    <p id="b1375-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1375.16",1375,[977,2242,757,507]]]'>I strongly disagree with my colleagues’ disposition of this case. I think the trial judge was absolutely right when she wrote in her opinion that “the law does not afford a cause of action for bad taste, boorishness, condescension, obnoxiousness, or social ineptitude.” Since the record, <em>even </em>when viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Drejza, establishes no more than that, I cannot join in the majority’s decision to reverse the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b1376-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.3",1376,[179,233,761,1184]]]'>
      <a id="p1318" href="#p1318" data-label="1318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1318</a>I do not disagree with the majority’s general summary of the law governing claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. I part company with my colleagues only over the application of the law to the facts of this ease, which in my view do not establish the commission of a tort. Detective Vaccaro’s treatment of Ms. Drejza was deplorable, but I do not see how it can be regarded as so “extreme” and “outrageous” as to be “beyond all possible bounds of decency,” or “atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Restatement (Seoond) of Torts § 46 comment d (1965). That is the standard which Ms. Drejza must meet,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and I do not think she has met it. This court in <em>Jackson v. District of Columbia, </em><a href="/a2d/412/0948-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="412 A.2d 948" data-case-ids="7992919" data-case-paths="/a2d/412/0948-01">412 A.2d 948</a>, 956-957 (D.C.1980), relying on the Restatement, affirmed a summary judgment for the District of Columbia on facts showing police misconduct at least as reprehensible as that shown here, perhaps more so. The trial judge, correctly in my view, relied on <em>Jackson </em>in rejecting Ms. Drejza’s claim. As the judge wrote in her opinion:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.4",1376,[216,1435,720,564]]]'>[I]f no tort was committed by the officers in <em>Jackson, </em>then no tort was committed by [Detective] Vaccaro. The bulk of the words uttered by Vaccaro were well within the range of predictable issues that a detective might raise, in order to ascertain whether a rape complainant is serious about wanting to go forward, whether she realizes the litigation traumas that await her, and whether she is aware of the tactical weaknesses in the prosecution’s ease that may not redound to her benefit.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.5",1376,[177,2025,756,469]],["BL_1376.6",1376,[986,233,753,362]]]'>Although Detective Vaccaro could certainly have been more gracious and considerate in choosing his words and in his overall dealings with Ms. Drejza, he would have failed in his duty as a police officer if he had not forcefully brought home to her the pitfalls in pursuing her rape complaint. Police officers, after all, are not social workers, nor should they be expected to think or behave like social workers. The very nature of their work causes them to be skeptical and suspicious when they receive a report of unlawful activity. They should not be obliged, on pain of potential civil liability, to put their skepticism aside while performing their professional duties. I fear that my colleagues are well on the way to creating a new tort of not being nice to a victim of crime.</p>
    <p id="b1376-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.9",1376,[981,623,758,1083]]]'>The majority also seems to be saying that because this case involves a rape victim, Detective Vaccaro should have recognized that she was “peculiarly susceptible to emotional distress,” Restatement, <em>supra, </em>§ 46 comment f, and therefore should have tempered his remarks accordingly. But I know of no case which says that a rape victim has a legal right to be treated more gently than a victim of any other violent crime, such as kidnapping or armed robbery. Any violent crime is a source of great trauma to its victim, and a person who has just been robbed at gunpoint is likely to be in no better psychological shape than someone who has just been raped. Although I do not deny that rape is unique in many ways and that it is likely to leave permanent psychological scars on its victim, rape is not <em>legally </em>unique so as to justify a rule giving rape victims special rights when being interviewed by investigating police officers, rights that other crime victims do not have.</p>
    <p id="b1376-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.10",1376,[981,1736,752,514]]]'>As a matter of common decency, Detective Vaccaro clearly should have treated Ms. Drejza with more respect and kindness. He should not have said much of what he said to her, should not have been smiling (or smirking) as he said it, should not have thrown her panties at her, should not have been, as Ms. Drejza said, “just a real jerk about it.” But common decency is a moral, not a legal duty. Detective Vaccaro may be a lout and a boor, or worse, but in my view he is no tortfeasor.</p>
