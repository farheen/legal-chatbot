Haskell appeals from his conviction in the Superior Court, York County, of impersonating a public servant, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 457 (1983). Because the record indicates that Haskell’s fine of $100 was paid in full on the same day that it was imposed, we grant the State’s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>

Procedural rules are not designed to inform on all facets of the law. Reference to either Maine treatise on criminal practice would dispel any notion that Haskell could appeal after paying his fine. 3 Glassman, <em>Maine Practice: Rules of Criminal Procedure Annotated </em>§ 38.2 at 326-7 (1967); 1 Cluchey &amp; Seitzinger, <em>Maine Criminal Practice </em>§ 38.3 at 38-6 (1985).

His argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, Haskell ignores the fact that in <em>Lewis </em>the notice of appeal had been entered <em>before </em>the fine was paid. Second, Haskell has made no effort to correct the Superior Court record to reflect a <em>deposit </em>of the fine rather than its payment.</p>
