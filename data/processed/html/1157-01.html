Ashe was injured in 1994 while riding as a passenger in a rental car owned by Enterprise. After settling with the driver and obtaining an uncontested damages judgment, Ashe seeks to recover the remainder of his damages from Enterprise or its surety, Travelers. Although by statute <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the common law, a passenger does not have a right of action against a rental company, Ashe contends that two statutes, 29 M.R.S.A. § 2708-A<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (requiring insurance coverage or a bond on rental vehicles), and 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2904 (2000) (the “reach and apply” statute), authorize his recovery.

Moore stipulated to his liability and consented to entry of judgment against him in an amount to be determined by the court. Moore’s insurer agreed to pay Ashe the liability limits under Moore’s policy, and Ashe agreed not to pursue additional recovery from Moore’s personal assets. Moore also assigned to Ashe his rights, if any, against Enterprise and Travelers.</p>

Ashe then initiated this action against Enterprise and Travelers to seek recovery of the remainder of the judgment obtained against Moore.</p>

He argues that the language in section 2708-A shows an intent to require coverage on vehicles held for rent <em>without limitation. </em>This interpretation, Ashe contends, is consistent with the broad public policy embodied in section 2708-A, to ensure that victims of the negligent operation of motor vehicles recover damages for their injuries.

Under the facts of this case, there is no such obligation. To rule otherwise would require us to invalidate a statute that specifically excludes recovery by a rental vehicle passenger from an owner.

To the contrary, the passenger exception to owner/renter joint and several liability continued in effect after mandatory coverage was enacted. <em>See </em>R.S.1954, ch. 22, § 157; and P.L.1993, ch. 683, § A-2.</p>
