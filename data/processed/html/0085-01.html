We affirm the judgment.</p>

    <p id="b142-7" data-blocks='[["BL_142.7",142,[253,1089,754,1038]]]'>The evidence at the trial may be summarized as follows: On the morning of August 19, 1993, a woman was walking toward Bucksport on the Silver Lake Road. Wayne Robbins approached her wearing no pants and masturbating. The woman saw his face and, in fact, made eye contact with him. Robbins jumped into the bushes when the woman yelled at him. After reporting the incident to the Bucksport police, the woman drove back to the Silver Lake Road, saw Robbins drive by, and followed him to a nearby residence. She returned to the police station that afternoon, examined a set of photographs prepared by Officer Patten, and immediately identified Robbins as the perpetrator. Over Robbins’s objection at the trial, the photographic lineup was admitted in evidence. The “mug shot type photographs” comprising the array do not contain numerals under each face, but there is a height chart behind each of the subjects.</p>

Although Robbins showed these photographs to the witnesses, he never offered them as evidence. During his cross-examination of Officer Patten, Robbins offered as evidence court records indicating that the alternate suspect had been twice convicted of public indecency. The court excluded from evidence the records of conviction when the State objected to them as inadmissible character evidence and as unfairly prejudicial pursuant to M.R.Evid. 403. The court, however, allowed Robbins to inquire whether Officer Patten considered the alternate suspect as a possible perpetrator in this case and whether Patten considered including a photograph of the alternate suspect in the photographic lineup shown to the woman. The jury found Robbins guilty, a judgment of conviction was entered, and Robbins filed this appeal.</p>

At the trial, Robbins agreed that he was offering the alternate suspect’s criminal record as a specific instance to impeach the person’s character, although that person had not testified and was not before the court. Robbins also conceded that he would argue that, because the person had a prior conviction for public indecency in 1990, the person acted in conformity with this particular proclivity in 1993. M.R.Evid. 404(a) precludes the admissibility of a person’s criminal record because the alternate suspect was not an “accused” or a “witness.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Rule 404(b) pre<a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>eludes the admissibility of prior convictions to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Rule 405(b) precludes the admissibility of this evidence as specific instances of conduct when the person’s character is not “in issue.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Generally, however, the State cannot introduce evidence in its ease in chief tending to show the bad character of the accused for the purpose of inducing belief in his guilt or disposition to commit the crime of which he is charged. M.R.Evid. 404(b). The fundamental reason why a “mug shot type photograph” of a defendant may be inadmissible is that it tends to inform the jury that the defendant may have a prior criminal record, thereby reflecting unfavorably on the accused’s character.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Nor were the jurors being asked to make comparative judgments between a photograph of Robbins and another suspect because the photographs of the alternate suspect were not admitted in evidence. Although Robbins made an issue of identification, he did not argue that the photographic array was improper or contributed to a false identification. Indeed he does not object to <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>showing the array to the victim for purposes of identification.
