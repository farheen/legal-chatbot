On July 19, 2005, Appellant was paroled at CR 992-2003, but was still serving the incarceration portion of his sentence imposed at CR 402-2004.

      <em> </em>probation revocation hearing was conducted on December 21, 2005 before Judge Vardaro. The judge determined that Appellant had violated the terms and conditions of his probationary sentences imposed at both docket numbers by consuming alcoholic beverages while on work release, and revoked his probation in each case, resentencing Appellant to consecutive terms of 1)6 years to 3 years imprisonment in each case. In doing so, the judge concluded that Appellant was likely to commit new crimes while on probation. Appellant timely appealed, presenting one question for our consideration, which we have paraphrased: Whether it is beyond the trial court’s authority to revoke the probationary period of Appellant’s sentence before it commenced where Appellant committed no additional crime, but violated work release policy?

He argues that the case law of this Commonwealth authorizes a trial court to revoke probationary sentences not yet begun only when a defendant has committed a new crime, and not merely a violation of a work release rule. <em>(Id.) </em>Accordingly, he seeks remand of this matter to the trial court for resentencing.</p>

A defendant on probation has no contract with the court.
