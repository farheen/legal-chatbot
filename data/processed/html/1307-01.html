On appeal defendant contends that the justice who presided at the jury trial erred i)' by excluding parol evidence tending to show that a 1924 deed in plaintiffs’ chain of title was intended by the grantor to convey only a fee simple determinable and ii) by ruling that, under the doctrine of estoppel by after-acquired title, defendant was precluded from contesting the capacity of the grantor of the 1924 deed to convey the entire fee simple interest in the disputed real estate. We deny the appeal.</p>
    <p id="b1352-22" data-blocks='[["BL_1352.26",1352,[1000,959,748,699]]]'>In 1906 Clarissa Richardson conveyed a parcel of land in Freedom by warranty deed to Jason Richardson’s five children. In 1924 Ralph Richardson, one of Clarissa’s five grantees in the 1906 deed, conveyed, again by warranty deed, a portion of that parcel — the lot involved in this litigation— to the town of Freedom. Only two of the 1906 deed’s four other grantees joined Ralph Richardson in that 1924 conveyance. In 1957, however, all the living representatives of Jason Richardson’s five children, except Ralph Richardson, joined in a quitclaim deed conveying their interests in the property to Ralph.</p>

Beginning in the 1950s, the building was used as a community center, rather than a school. In 1969 the town, by quitclaim deed, conveyed the real estate to plaintiffs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Over the next two years, plaintiffs converted the building into a home. Defendant was the adjoining landowner on three sides of the schoolhouse lot. During plaintiffs’ first few <a id="p1309" href="#p1309" data-label="1309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1309</a>years in Freedom, defendant never indicated that he thought he had any claim to the property. To the contrary, the jury could have found that defendant recognized plaintiffs’ ownership of the schoolhouse lot, inasmuch as Mr. Taylor testified that defendant asked and obtained permission to haul logs from the portion of his property on the far side of the schoolhouse lot across the lot to the adjoining public road.</p>
    <p id="b1353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1353.4",1353,[214,747,750,723]]]'>In the spring of 1975 plaintiffs moved out of the converted schoolhouse and put the property on the market. In early July of that year, while the Taylors were away on vacation, the building burned to the ground, leaving only the two chimneys standing. Mr. Taylor testified that on a subsequent return to the lot, he found defendant sitting on a bulldozer on the property. The remains of the house had been pushed into a pile, trees on the lot had been cut down, and certain property belonging to plaintiffs had been removed. Mr. Taylor stated that defendant on that occasion said he was now the owner of the property and that he had a deed to it.</p>
    <p id="b1353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1353.5",1353,[212,1499,749,1061]]]'>Plaintiffs then commenced this action in District Court (Belfast). Count I asked the court to quiet title to the schoolhouse lot in plaintiffs, pursuant to 14 M.R.S.A. §§ 6651-54 (1980); Count II sought to remove any cloud from plaintiffs’ title to that lot, under 14 M.R.S.A. §§ 6655-58; and Count III demanded damages for defendant’s trespass upon that lot. Defendant removed the case to the Superior Court. There, defendant filed his answer and counterclaim, alleging that he, not plaintiffs, owned the schoolhouse lot and pleading both a quiet title action under 14 M.R.S.A. §§ 6651-58 and a real action under <em>id., </em>§ 6701. Defendant’s answer also denied plaintiffs’ trespass claim and asserted a separate counterclaim for alleged trespass upon other land belonging to him. The jury returned special verdicts in favor of plaintiffs’ claims and against defendant’s. Following the denial of his motion for new trial, defendant now appeals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In that deed the words of inheritance, “heirs and assigns,” were deleted by hand wherever they appeared. Nonetheless, as so modified, that deed had a clear and unambiguous legal effect, namely, that of a conveyance in fee simple to the town of Freedom.

The excision of the words “heirs and assigns” from the printed deed is explained in practical terms by the fact that the town of Freedom obviously does not have heirs. Furthermore, even with that excision, the habendum clause continued to convey the property “to the said Town of Freedom, their use and behoof forever.” The conveyance as so worded hardly expresses any intent “to create an estate other than a fee simple.” <em>Restatement of Property, supra, </em>§ 35.</p>

Defendant’s assertion is without merit. Ralph Richardson in 1957 acquired a deed to the schoolhouse lot from the representatives of all four other grantees in the 1906 conveyance from Clarissa Richardson. Under the familiar principle of estoppel by after-acquired title, Ralph Richardson and all who hold under him, as does defendant Arthur Richardson, are precluded from challenging that title. The 1957 acquisition of full title by the grantor of the 1924 deed estops defendant from now asserting any incompleteness in plaintiffs’ title based on Ralph Richardson’s less-than-full fee simple title in the schoolhouse lot in 1924, since “a grantee of one who has warranted a title he did not possess takes the title warranted if his grantor subsequently acquires it.” <em>Loose-Wiles Biscuit Co. v.
