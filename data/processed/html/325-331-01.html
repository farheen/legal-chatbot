    <p id="b386-15" data-blocks='[["BL_386.15",386,[1041,327,750,711]]]'>Richard Gleason Knowles was tried by jury and was found guilty of indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child in connection with conduct directed toward his teenage step-granddaughter. Post-trial motions were denied, and Knowles was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On direct appeal from the judgment of sentence, Knowles argues that the trial court erred when it allowed the alleged victim to testify to incidents of sexual abuse by appellant while the parties were living in Texas several years before the offenses charged in this case. This is a difficult issue and requires our careful review.</p>
    <p id="b386-16" data-blocks='[["BL_386.16",386,[1038,1089,748,813]]]'>The evidence was that during the summer of 1989 or 1990, when Amy J. K. was either 13 or 14 years of age, she went to live with Knowles and his wife, who was Amy’s grandmother. Amy’s grandparents had recently moved to Pennsylvania from Texas and had established a home in close proximity to where Amy lived. Thereafter, during the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, while Amy and Knowles were alone in the latter’s home, Knowles called to Amy as she stepped from the shower to sit with him on the couch. When she did so, Knowles moved the towel which was around her and inserted two fingers in her vagina. He told her she was “being good” and shouldn’t say anything to anyone about what had happened.</p>

When she refused, appellant removed the child’s pants and penetrated her digitally in the same manner as before. He told her again that she was a good girl and should not say anything because if she did people would be disappointed in her. There was also testimony that appellant would ask Amy to hug and kiss him; whereupon, he would fondle her breasts through her clothing. At some time thereafter, Amy moved back with her mother and father. Amy ran away in the fall of 1991. Upon her return, she stayed with an aunt and uncle. The <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>alleged abuse stopped once Amy went to live with her relatives.</p>

At that time, Knowles was divorced from Amy’s grandmother and was living alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Amy stayed with appellant for a week when her parents, who were also living in Texas, made a trip to Pennsylvania. She testified that appellant had told her there were two beds in his bedroom and she was expected to sleep with him. On the first night, appellant asked her to come into his bedroom and give him a good night kiss. According to Amy, when she went in, appellant was undressed. He then removed her pajamas and told her to “sit on top of him.” When she did so, according to her testimony, appellant had sexual intercourse with her. He told her she was a good girl and should not say anything to anyone. This conduct was repeated for the next five nights. Amy was also asked to “put [her] mouth on his private part” and did as she was requested. When her family returned from Pennsylvania she said nothing of these events to them. Amy’s family moved to Pennsylvania the following year.</p>

At the time of the events for which appellant was being tried in Pennsylvania, Amy was thirteen or fourteen years of age. The several incidents, therefore, were separated by a period of at least five years, and possibly by as many as seven years. Remoteness, however, is only one factor to be considered when determining the admissibility of the evidence. Packel and Poulin, Pennsylvania Evidence § 405.1, at 172. Whether evidence is too remote in time to be probative, moreover, is largely within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v.

He and Amy were alone every night for a week, and the sexual assaults continued over a six day period. They were committed by one who normally did not have the opportunity to become intimate with Amy. The acts stopped when Amy returned to her parents and, of course, after she moved with her parents to Pennsylvania. After appellant also moved to Pennsylvania, however, the sexual abuse was resumed when appellant had an opportunity to be alone with Amy. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was relevant to show that appellant had a continuing passion for illicit sexual contact with Amy and acted on that passion when the opportunity arose.
