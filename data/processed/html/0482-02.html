The court further notes that this is not a case where appellant will be “unable to secure the formal entry of an appealable order pursuant to the usual procedures” if the matter is pursued in the first instance in the lower court.

In the body of his brief, appellant insists that the PCRA court’s supposed delay compelled his action and that Pa. R.A.P. 801(e) “was designed just for circumstances like this one.” Appellant’s Brief at 23. Appellant attempts to justify his action by declaring that he “is a death row prisoner. His attempts to have his claims heard were thwarted by the inaction of the PCRA court, despite requests for a hearing from both sides...

Commonwealth’s Brief at 9. The Commonwealth observes that the “inherent danger in making up motions and filings like [protective petitions] when none are provided for within the rules is that they will not be read.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 12.

Indeed, no action of any kind, much less any action or order adverse to appellant’s interests, was taken by the PCRA court concerning appellant’s deceptively labeled serial PCRA petition. Appellant’s praecipe was not any kind of order of court, let alone a final order. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 102 (order includes “judgment, decision, decree, sentence and adjudication”); Pa.R.A.P. 341 (final order is one that disposes of all claims and all parties; or is expressly defined as such by statute; or is entered upon trial court’s determination that immediate appeal from otherwise interlocutory order would facilitate resolution of entire case). Appellant’s claim in his brief that his self-help praecipe serves as the appealable order wrongly assumes that his action was justified under the Rule he invokes. In the praecipe he filed below and again in his appellate brief, appellant cites Pa.R.A.P. 301(d) and (e) as establishing a basis for jurisdiction via his praecipe. Neither subsection of Rule 301 was properly invoked.</p>

Thus, even if it is assumed that appellant’s prae-cipe was properly filed, the absence of an order from the clerk renders this appeal subject to quashal as a Rule 301(d) matter. Moreover, as the praecipe and notice of appeal were filed simultaneously, appellant did not even engage in the pretense of waiting for entry of any such order.

Subsection (d) requires that the praecipe relate to an “action from which an appeal lies either as of right or upon permission to appeal or allowance of appeal.” There is no mechanism for an appeal “as of right” from the trial court’s “inaction” in the four months following appellant’s latest, mislabeled PCRA pleading. <em>Cf. </em>Pa.R.Civ.P.

By its plain terms, this subsection contemplates: 1) an exigency that not merely authorizes, but “compels” an immediate appeal; 2) an actual “adverse action” by the tribunal below which is the proper subject of an immediate appeal, but which has not yet been recognized by the formal entry of an order; and 3) an “inability” (not a mere disinclination) on the part of the aggrieved party to “secure” the formality of entry of the order by “usual procedures.” The Rule thus contemplates an existing, appealable adverse action, and exigent circumstances; with the “mere formality” of the entry of the order missing; where normal channels of seeking entry of the order have been attempted, to no avail. None of these elements, essential to a party’s invoking the rather extraordinary avenue of appeal provided in Rule 301(e), were remotely present here.</p>

Tellingly, he did not. Second, in point of fact, there was no “adverse,” ap-pealable “action” by the PCRA court, lacking only recognition by the “formality” of entry of an order, for appellant to appeal. Appellant’s feigned complaint here is that the trial court failed to act within a time frame that appellant appears to believe he is at liberty to establish — a failure attributable, in no small measure, to appellant’s deceptive labeling of what could only properly have been a serial PCRA petition. That is not an appealable, adverse “action.”</p>

Again, appellant never asked the trial court to enter an order, adverse or not. He did not file for expedition. He did not ask for a report on the status of his “protective” petition. Nor did he seek an order from this Court directing the trial court to act. And, finally, he never identified under what authority he believes he has the unilateral power to determine when a matter has not been decided in timely fashion, so that he may create an <em>ad hoc </em>appealable order. Under these circumstances, appeal cannot lie pursuant to Rule 301(e). <em>See Township of Concord v.

Although appellant cited Rule 301(d), he obviously had no intention of permitting the court or the Commonwealth to address his supposed concern, since he took his “appeal” immediately.

The complete, prolix title of appellant’s filing is “Seifullah Abdul-Salaam's Third <em>Protective </em>Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief Pursuant to Article I, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution And Statutory Post-Conviction Relief Under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 et seq. and Consolidated Memorandum of Law” (emphasis in original).</p>

This sort of delay-inducing "ping-ponging” between state and federal courts, unfortunately, is not uncommon in Pennsylvania capital cases; the known local federal practice of holding pending habeas petitions in abeyance while counsel files frivolous, time-barred serial PCRA petitions naturally encourages state capital litigants to pursue serial PCRA petitions, thus ensuring delay in the ultimate resolution of their cases.</p>

Despite the fact that the federal matter had by that time been stayed, appellant still styled his August 2008 and April 2009 filings as "protective,” going so far as to underline the word "protective” in the first paragraph of his August 2008 pleading.</p>

The lower court docket reflects that appellant’s praecipe, notice of appeal, Motion for Leave to Appeal in Forma Pauperis, and related statements were all filed, and date-stamped "FILED,” on August 24, 2009, a Monday. The deputy clerk of courts entered an order that same day, granting appellant leave to appeal in forma pauperis.</p>

The notice of appeal states that appellant "hereby appeals to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from each and every aspect of the <em>Praecipe for Entry of Adverse Order </em>denying and dismissing <em>Petitioner/Appellant's Third Protective Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief Under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 et seq. and Consolidated Memorandum of Law </em>filed on January 16, 2007, as amended and supplemented on August 26, 2008 and April 17, 2009, said <em>Praecipe </em>having been filed in this Court on August 18, 2009” (emphasis in original). Appellant's certificates of service indicate that he sent the documents to the PCRA court judge and the Commonwealth’s attorney by overnight mail on August 18, 2009, but the filing date of Monday, August 24 no doubt reflects when the mailed documents were actually received by the clerk of courts. The salient point for our purposes is that the appeal was filed at the same time as the prae-cipe.</p>
