A.P. Weilersbacher, Inc. (Weilers-bacher) was a distributor of malt and brewed as well as non-alcoholic beverages in Allegheny County. In 1988, Weilersbacher had exclusive distribution agreements with Latrobe Brewing Company (Latrobe)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and other manufacturers, including the Heilman Brewing Company (Heilman) and Straub Brewing Company (Straub). Desiring to retire from the malt and brewed beverage distribution business, Weilersbacher decided to sell its exclusive distribution rights to another distributor. Consequently, Weilersbacher entered into an agreement in March of 1988 with appellant/cross-appellee, Alfred M. Lutheran Distributors, Inc. (Lutheran). Pursuant to the agreement, Lutheran was to acquire the exclusive distribution rights of Latrobe, Heilman and Straub, subject to Lutheran obtaining the approval of these manufacturers. Lutheran subsequently met with representatives of Latrobe/Labatt, supplied them with pertinent information regarding the proposed transaction and requested approval of the transfer.</p>
    <p id="b142-17" data-blocks='[["BL_142.18",142,[987,1586,753,610]],["BL_143.1",143,[138,227,753,180]]]'>Latrobe/Labatt preferred that Weilers-bacher transfer its distribution rights to Brandt Distributors, Inc. (Brandt) and suggested that Weilersbacher meet with Brandt. Accordingly, Weilersbacher began negotiating with Brandt for the sale of the same products previously offered to Lutheran. <em>As </em>a result, Brandt submitted a request for approval of the transfer of the Latrobe/Labatt rights while Lutheran’s request was pending. Although Lutheran initially secured the approval of Heilman and Straub, Latrobe/La-batt rejected Lutheran’s application.

In September of 1988, Lutheran settled with Weilersbacher in exchange for transfer of the Straub distribution rights and payment of $125,000.00. The case thus proceeded to trial against Latrobe and Labatt following which the jury returned a verdict in favor of Lutheran in the sum of $2,000,000.00.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Timely post-trial motions were filed by both parties. With the exception of Latrobe’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which was granted, the remaining motions were denied by the trial court. Judgment was duly entered in favor of Latrobe and both Lutheran and Latrobe respectively initiated their timely appeal and cross-appeal therefrom.</p>

In addition, cross-appellant-Latrobe contends that the trial court erred in: (1) permitting Lutheran to introduce evidence of damages relating to the loss of the Heilman distribution rights; (2) refusing to strike the testimony of appellant’s damages expert because it was speculative and lacking in foundation; and (3) allowing the case to be tried by a jury of ten individuals, where the parties previously stipulated to a jury of no less than eleven.

Further, a judge’s appraisement of the evidence is not to be based on how he would have voted had he been a member of the jury, but on the facts as they come through the sieve of the jury’s deliberations. There are two bases upon which a judgment n.o.v. can be entered: one, the mov-ant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and/or two, the evidence was such that no two reasonable minds could disagree that the outcome should have been rendered in favor of the movant. With the first, a court reviews the record and concludes that even with all factual inferences decided adverse to the movant the law nonetheless requires a verdict in his favor, whereas with the second the court reviews the evidentiary record and concludes that the evidence was such that a verdict for the movant was beyond peradventure.</blockquote>

To bring action pursuant to this statute, a distributor/importing distributor must have an existing written agreement with the manufacturer. 47 P.S. § 4-431(d)(1). Moreover, where a manufacturer has designated a distributor as a primary distributor under § 4-431(d)(5), the agreement between the parties can only be altered or terminated for good cause, as defined in § 4-431(d)(l). 47 P.S. § 4 — 131(d)(1). Before a manufacturer can terminate its agreement with a primary distributor or importing distributor, however, the manufacturer must give notice of any deficiencies or the reason for the termination, which the distributor then has the opportunity to rectify or challenge. 47 P.S. § 4-492(19). None of these provisions are relevant in this instance because appellant was not attempting to enjoin Latrobe from terminating or modifying an existing distribution agreement without good cause or compliance with the notice requirements.

The question remains whether the standard should be adopted as the standard of due care in this case.... A statute providing for criminal liability but not civil liability leaves a court free to accept or not accept the legislatively established standard of conduct for a tort action. The decision to accept the standard is purely a judicial one, for the court to make.

However, the question of whether, appellant had standing to generally institute suit against Latrobe for any wrongs it committed was never at issue here. Instead, the only matter to be addressed was whether appellant, as a proposed purchaser of Weilersbaeher’s distribution rights, had standing to maintain a private statutory cause of action under § 4 — 492(20)(i) of the Liquor Code and the trial court confined its ruling to this narrow inquiry. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, dated December 21, 1993, at 3-5. In light of our previous discussion and conclusion that § 4-492(20) does not explicitly or implicitly give rise to any private statutory cause of action for damages thereunder, it follows that prospective purchasers do not have standing to maintain such an action against a manufacturer pursuant to this provision.</p>

In construing § 1929, it is evident that the General Assembly did nothing more than express its recognition of an injured person’s right to recover damages from an offender who violates a penal statute. In other words, the existence of a criminal statute and the penalties which may be imposed for a violation thereof does not preclude an injured person from instituting a civil action which is authorized by law to recover damages. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S.A. § 107(c) (this section does not bar, suspend or otherwise affect any right of liability to damages, penalty, forfeiture or other remedy authorized by law to be recovered or enforced in a civil action, regardless of whether the conduct involved in such civil action or matter constitutes an offense). Section 1929 thus contemplates that an injured party may enforce whatever remedies he or she may have either by way of a statutorily authorized civil action or a common law action even though the conduct involved in the action is defined as a criminal offense.

Although the comments offer little guidance as to the class of individuals which subsection (20) was designed to protect, they do suggest that the legislature was more concerned with equalizing the rights of the distributor or importing distributor with whom the manufacturer had a relationship rather than with the rights of a prospective purchaser. <em>See </em>Legislative Journal of the Senate, Vol. 2, No. 36 at 1742 (June 3, 1980) (in which Senator Kelley stated, in response to Senator Copper-smith’s proposed amendment and remarks in support thereof, that the text contained in subsection (19) is “truly the very important substance[] of the bill itself. It is the equalizer between the individual distributor, the importing distributor and the malt beverage manufacturer.”) Senator Kelley further commented that the General Assembly was adopting the amendments to § 4 — 492 because of the "many, many abuses in th[e] [malt and brewed beverage] industry.... ” <em><a href="/us/422/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="422 U.S. 66" data-case-ids="9468" data-case-paths="/us/422/0066-01">Id.</a> </em>The fact that the General Assembly was concerned with rectifying perceived abuses in the malt and brewed beverage trade should not, as suggested by appellant, be interpreted as an indication that the General Assembly was concerned with protecting the rights of prospective purchasers.

The essence of the majority’s holding is that the defendant could not be held liable as a matter of law, because the statute only imposed a duty upon licensees rather than on social hosts. Justice Manderino disagreed with the majority’s interpretation of § 4 — 493(1) and concluded that the statute did impose a duty upon the defendant since by its express terms it prohibited a licensee or any other person from furnishing or giving liquor to any person who was visibly intoxicated. <em><a href="/citations/?q=310%20A.2d%2075" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="310 A.2d 75">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/454/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="454 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="579887" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0237-01">454 Pa. at 246-248</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=310%20A.2d%2075" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="310 A.2d 75">310 A.2d at 79-80</a>.</p>

The parties refer us to cases involving the transfer of distribution rights involving both alcoholic beverages and automobile dealerships. The decisions and statutes pertaining to automotive dealerships are irrelevant and need not be considered since Pennsylvania has its own statute governing the relationship between automotive manufacturers and dealers. <em>See </em>Board of Vehicles Act (BOVA), 63 P.S. § 818.1-§ 818.28. The BOVA makes it unlawful for any manufacturer, factoiy branch or distributor to "[ujnrea-sonably withhold consent to the sale, transfer or exchange of the franchise to a qualified buyer capable of being licensed as a new vehicle dealer in this Commonwealth." 63 P.S. § 818.9(b)(3). In addition, the statute specifically provides that</p>

Review of Pennsylvania’s automobile dealer statute thus reveals that the General Assembly was capable of expressly providing for a private statutory cause of action when it has chosen to do so. The absence of a similar provision in the Liquor Code compels us to conclude that the General Assembly did not intend to create a private statutory cause of action thereunder.</p>
