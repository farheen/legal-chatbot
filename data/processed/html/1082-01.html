He sustained injuries to his shoulder, knee, face and hand, and chipped his ankle. His ankle also had a six inch gash where a scar remains. The woman took Appellee into a nearby house where she allowed him to wash up and gave him a glass of water. She refused to drive Appellee to the hospital, but agreed to drive him to his mother’s house three blocks away and to follow him to the hospital. The woman failed to ap<a id="p1084" href="#p1084" data-label="1084" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1084</a>pear at the hospital; while being treated there, Appellee reported the accident to the police.

On September 15, 1998, the Honorable Marvin R. Halbert granted Appellants’ motion to file a written post-trial motion <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>That motion was denied on January 15, 1999.

The statutory provisions governing the Assigned Claims Plan (ACP) and payments under the Plan are found in Subchapter E of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1751-1757. The legislature set up the ACP to provide limited statutory benefits to certain “eligible claimants” injured in automobile-related accidents who are not entitled to recover other insurance benefits. The ACP is not an insurance company but rather an administrative organization that distributes the financial responsibility for those limited statutory benefits among Pennsylvania’s automobile insurers as a cost of doing business and through the insurers’ policy holders. <em>Hodges v.
