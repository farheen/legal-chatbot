The trial judge suspended imposition of sentence and placed Brown on two years’ supervised probation. On April 9, 1993 the trial court issued an order to show cause why probation should not be revoked. The show cause order alleged three probation violations: failure to keep appointments with the probation officer, failure to complete community service as required, and a January 2,1993 arrest for theft in Maryland.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Brown failed to appear for the April 20, 1993 revocation hearing, and a bench warrant was issued.

At the start of the hearing, the trial judge informed Brown that he would consider the robbery conviction in deciding whether to revoke probation. Brown objected that the robbery did not appear in the show cause order and therefore, because the original probationary term had expired, the court retained jurisdiction only to revoke on the grounds set forth in the order. The trial judge offered to continue the hearing to give Brown an opportunity to prepare a defense to revocation on the basis of the robbery conviction. Brown declined and the hearing went forward.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court revoked Brown’s probation on the basis of the robbery conviction alone.</p>

This view is inconsistent not only with our case law as set forth above but also with § 24-104 itself, which requires the trial court to revoke probation, if at all, “during the probationary term.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> D.C.Code § 24-104 (1981); <em>Neal v.

Appellant would require the trial court to issue a new show cause order for each suspected subsequent violation in order to retain jurisdiction as to such violations beyond the expiration of the original term of probation. We see no reason for such a demanding formality; the appellant by the issuance of the original show cause order had already been apprised that his probationary status was in jeopardy. <em>See Dent, <a href="/a2d/465/0841-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="465 A.2d 841" data-case-ids="7966463" data-case-paths="/a2d/465/0841-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/465/0841-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="465 A.2d 841" data-case-ids="7966463" data-case-paths="/a2d/465/0841-01">465 A.2d at 843</a> (a show cause order extends the probationary term if it “put[s] the probationer on notice that probable cause exists for revocation of probation”).
