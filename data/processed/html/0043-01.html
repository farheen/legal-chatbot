Gammon appeal from a Superior Court (Cumberland County, <em>Fritzsche, J.) </em>judgment wherein the court adopted a survey plan<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (the “Wood Survey”) as accurately depicting the boundary line between the parties’ respective parcels of land. By adopting the Wood Survey, the Superior Court impliedly found that the Strouts had established their title to the real property in question. On appeal, the Gammons argue that: (1) the court erred in adopting the Wood Survey; and, (2) they were entitled to reformation to reflect the intention of their predecessors in title. Because we agree that: (1) in light of the entire record, the court’s unqualified adoption of the Wood Survey was clearly erroneous; (2) the Strouts did not meet their burden of proof; and, (3) the Gammons are entitled to have their action for declaratory judgment and reformation heard on the merits, we vacate, in part, the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

Gammon own an adjacent, improved parcel of land. At the Strouts’ request, Wood surveyed the properties and prepared the Wood Survey plan depicting his findings. This survey plan depicted the “buffer zone” boundary between the parties’ properties closer to the Gammon residence than previously thought and, as a result, it depicted a storage building, built by Gammon, encroaching on the Strouts’ property. Further, Wood determined that title to a triangular parcel of land (the “gore”) at the rear of the parties' lots was held by Laurette (Strout) Jordan. The gore, as depicted on the Wood Survey, is bisected by a line and the Gammons’ pool and well are located on the larger, four-sided parcel within the gore. At the time the survey was done, the Strouts had no actual or colorable claim to the gore. Subsequently, Paul Strout secured the signature of Laurette Jordan, his stepmother, on a deed he prepared purporting to convey the gore to him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The court, while noting that the deed descriptions do not clearly identify the boundaries, found the Wood Survey to be persuasive “because Wood testified convincingly[,] his survey was detailed and involved field and registry work.” The court concluded by stating that Wood’s interpretation, “coupled with the clearer long-standing boundaries of the Gammons indicate that the Strouts’ parcel includes the ‘buffer zone,’ [and] the Gammons have a well-defined parcel [with] the boundary [as] ascertained by [Wood].” We disagree.

Indeed, the legal descriptions in the deeds submitted in support of the Strouts’ claims were ambiguously worded and irreconcilably at odds with the known boundaries of the tract of land. Consequently, Wood, when surveying the tract at issue for the Strouts, was forced to work backwards from the relatively clear legal description contained in the Gammons’ deed. Once Wood inserted the Gammons’ parcel on his plan, he proceeded to prepare the plan resolving all ambiguities in a manner that happened to be favorable to his clients. In so doing, Wood, and the court by its adoption of the Wood Survey, ignored the significance of several key pieces of evidence as well as the history of use of the parcels in question. In short, “facts” on which Wood based his conclusions are not supported by the record and his conclusion, graphically depicted by the Wood Survey, predictably <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>reflects his use of flawed foundational facts and supposition.</p>

It appears to us, however, the Emery survey more accurately depicts the common boundary between the parties’ respective parcels. Review of a grant from the Strouts’ predecessor in title, Ruth A. Day, confirms this conclusion. In 1966, Day conveyed to Earl F. Verrill, by description that referred to the northwest corner as being “at land formerly of D.R. Small, now of Robert B Home,” property that is depicted on the Wood Survey as that of Cecile I. Caron. Thus, in 1966, Ruth A. Day, Paul Strout’s mother and predecessor in title, recognized the “buffer zone” as belonging to the Gammon’s predecessor in title, Robert B. Horne. Moreover, all of the subsequent deeds of record in the Car-on chain recognize the present or former interest of Horne in the “buffer zone.”</p>

In making this observation, the court appears to be impliedly finding that Laurette (Strout) Jordan did not own the gore and thus could not have conveyed it to the Hornes who subsequently conveyed it to the Gammons. This finding, however, flies in the face of Wood’s testimony and plan that were explicitly adopted by the court. The court, by accepting the plan, accepted the fact that Laurette Jordan retained title to the gore and thus in <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>fact had something to transfer to Strout. In essence, the court found that Jordan had title to the gore when it adopted the plan and by implication validated the 1988 transfer of title to the gore from Jordan to Strout but then found that Jordan did not have title to the gore for purposes of the Gammons’ reformation action. On the facts of this case, one or the other has to be true. The Superior Court’s reasoning is inherently inconsistent. Based on Wood’s testimony and the deeds in question, it is clear that Jordan in fact retained title to property claimed by the Gammons’ lot when Jordan and her deceased husband transferred the remainder of their property to the school.</p>

We agree. The Hornes then transferred title to the property to the Gammons. While the Gam-mons’ lot as depicted on the plan comports with the language of the deed, Jordan testified on cross-examination that she intended-to convey title to all of the property she owned to the Homes.</p>
