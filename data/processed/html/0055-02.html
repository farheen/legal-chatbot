Appellant raises two issues for our consideration: (i) whether the physical evidence seized from his person should have been suppressed becáuse the arresting officer lacked probable cause to conduct a search; and (ii) whether the evidence should have been suppressed because the scope of the search exceeded that permitted under the state constitution. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b100-23" data-blocks='[["BL_100.24",100,[979,1970,759,660]]]'>On October 22,1996, at approximately 3.00 p.m., Officer Michael McLaughlin of the Upper Allen police department, was contacted by a local resident, Robert Poisez. Mr. Poi-sez told Officer McLaughlin that on the stairs of a local house, he had observed an individual holding a .45 pistol to the back of another person. Mr. Poisez did not know the exact address where he saw this incident, but offered to return with Officer McLaughlin to the scene and to point out the house. Mr. Poisez described the suspect as a white male in his late teens wearing a dark colored jacket with a hood.</p>

The address was 336 Gettysburg Pike, a house with which Officer McLaughlin was familiar. Upon arrival, Officer McLaughlin observed an unfamiliar dark blue Ford Probe in the driveway. While examining the vehicle, Officer McLaughlin observed the smell of burnt marijuana emanating from an open front window. A computer search of the license plate number disclosed that the vehicle was registered to Michael Stoner, appellant in this ease.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[206,831,756,947]]]'>Officer McLaughlin knocked on the door of the house. Appellant, a white male in his late teens, answered the door. Appellant was wearing a dark jacket with a hood. When asked his name, the individual replied that it was “Michael Stone”. Officer McLaughlin explained why he was there, then turned appellant around and conducted a pat down search. During the search, Officer McLaughlin felt a small pipe in the right front pocket of the jacket. Officer McLaughlin, who subsequently testified to his extensive experience in drug arrests, removed the pipe and continued to search appellant for weapons. He located a handgun, which was also removed from appellant, but nothing more. Officer McLaughlin then arrested appellant for possession of drug paraphernalia based on the pipe that Officer McLaughlin had found in appellant’s pocket.</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[206,1810,753,566]]]'>No charges were filed based on the gun incident. After appellant’s arrest, Carly Weaver, the daughter of the homeowners, informed Officer McLaughlin that she had been the person who Mr. Poisez had seen with appellant, and that the incident had been a joke. The gun itself was a Crossman .177 BB gun, a less powerful weapon than a .45. At the police station, appellant gave an essentially identical explanation of the gun incident to that of Ms. Weaver. Appellant admitted that the pipe was his.</p>

Although appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Santana </em>on the grounds that Officer McLaughlin did not possess probable cause to make an arrest in this case, the logic of <em>Santana </em>compels the conclusion that a similar rule should exist for pat-down searches. Just as the police may effect an arrest of an individual standing in a doorway provided they have the requisite probable cause to believe that the individual has committed a crime, so they may perform a stop and frisk if they possess the requisite reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or is imminent and that the individual is armed and dangerous.
