The minor plaintiffs were four-year old female students at Breezy Point Day School for an indicated period of time; and appellant-defendant, Jane Roe, was the minors’ teacher. The complaints aver that appellants sexually, physically, and mentally abused the minors during the course of the minors’ attendance at the school, on “diverse occasions,” and subjected the minors to demonic rituals in an effort to frighten them so they would not reveal what had happened to them. With the proviso <em>“inter alia,” </em>the three complaints allege specific acts of sexual, physical and mental abuse, including averments that the children were: forced to endure digital penetration of the vagina; forced to view and touch appellant-defendant Jane Roe’s breasts and pubic area; forced to consume drugs of unknown origin; forced to participate in rituals involving the slaughter of animals; forced to eat human feces and drink urine; forced to remain in a locked cage; forced to remain in a locked room; forced to take part in irresponsible and life threatening activities such as setting fires; forced into a bed with other children who were partially clothed; forced to play games during which children took off various items of clothing; forced to engage in sexual acts with other children; forced away from school grounds to engage in sexual acts in a hotel. Plaintiffs accused appellants of threatening the minors, by use of a knife, that if they told their parents what was happening, the minors would suffer various consequences and anything the children said would be heard by their teacher regardless of where the minors happened to be. Plaintiffs averred physical beatings occurred on “diverse occasions.” Each complaint made additional averments as follows:</p>

The Bucks County District Attorney’s Office assumed the investigation on October 25, 1989. In his report dated March, 1990, the district attorney concluded that there was no basis whatsoever to file criminal charges. The district attorney reported that the evidence produced over an eleven-month period indicated that the allegations of abuse are unfounded, without merit; and no credible evidence existed to support the allegations. <em>Bucks County District Attorney's Office Repor</em>t—Investi<em>gation into Breezy Point Day School, </em>March, 1990 at 3-4.</p>

The appellants sought to recover money damages for bodily harm resulting from their daughter's molestation. The complaint also alleged <em>negligent </em>infliction of personal injury. Floyd sought defense of the civil action by State Farm under his homeowner's policy. State Farm agreed to defend subject to a reservation of rights to contest coverage on the ground that the insured's conduct fell within the standard homeowner's policy coverage exclusion for bodily injury "intended or expected” by the insured. The parties stipulated to: Floyd’s culpability, the value of the appellants' claim in the event that they should prevail, and the filing of a declaratory judgment action against State Farm to decide the applicability of the homeowner's policy to the appellant’s claim.</p>
