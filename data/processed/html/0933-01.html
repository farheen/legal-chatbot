The trial court concluded that “the only reasonable conclusion that a jury could reach is that [appellant] did consent to the statement by Easter-ling.” The trial court assumed <em>arguendo </em>that malice could overcome the defense of consent and found that appellant had failed to put forth evidence sufficient to establish that Providence Hospital and Easterling had acted maliciously.

The terms of the release directly benefitted Providence Hospital and Easterling by absolving them of all liability for providing information concerning appellant’s employment record. As noted, the release specifically identified the intended beneficiaries as those entities and individuals named in appellant’s employment application, which included Providence Hospital and Easterling. Thus the fact that Providence Hospital and Easter-ling were not signatories to the release does not prevent them from raising the release as a defense to appellant’s defamation claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellant cites no case law to support her assertion, and our research has not uncovered any case directly on point. We are unpersuaded, however, that the consent given by appellant is invalid merely because Easterling learned of it after she had made the defamatory remarks. The maxim <em>volenti non fit injuria </em>appears apt in this case — “the invasion of a person’s interest cannot be a tort when such person is willing to have that invasion take place and has legal capacity to consent to the invasion.” 2 Fowler V. Harper et al. The Law of Torts § 5.17, at 138 (2d ed.1986) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). Our focus, therefore, is on whether the aggrieved party, appellant, consented to the alleged defamation, rather than on when appellees learned of appellant’s consent. <em>See Derzavis v. Security Storage Co., </em><a href="/a2d/703/0839-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="703 A.2d 839" data-case-ids="11886192" data-case-paths="/a2d/703/0839-01">703 A.2d 839</a>, 840 (D.C.1997) (release entered into after breach of contract claim arose is an enforceable contract by which the parties are bound). We <a id="p938" href="#p938" data-label="938" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*938</a>conclude that the mere fact that Providence Hospital and Easterling were unaware of the release at the time Easterling made the statements in question does not invalidate appellant’s consent created by the release.</p>
    <p id="b980-4" data-blocks='[["BL_980.4",980,[203,630,756,1672]]]'>Appellant’s second argument on appeal is that summary judgment was improper because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether she consented to the furnishing of any information beyond that which the employee manual stated would be provided. However, appellant again does not provide any legal authority for her assertion. Appellant, of course, could not sue Providence Hospital for defamation merely because Providence Hospital released more information than that described in the employee manual. This is necessarily true because defamation requires that the statements be false rather than merely excessive. <em>See Moss v. Stockard, </em><a href="/a2d/580/1011-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="580 A.2d 1011" data-case-ids="7374523" data-case-paths="/a2d/580/1011-01">580 A.2d 1011</a>, 1022 (D.C.1990) (truth is an absolute defense in defamation law). We agree with Providence Hospital that the breach of any duty created by the employee manual to limit the release of information (assuming the manual creates such a duty) in no way limits the validity or breadth of the release from tortious defamation, which appellant subsequently entered into for the benefit of Providence Hospital and Easterling. Appellant’s consent contained in the release was broader than the provision of the employee manual. Therefore, we conclude that the release is valid and acts as a consent to the assumedly defamatory statements by Providence Hospital and Easterling.</p>

Preliminary, we note that the parties differ on whether malice is material in this context. Appellant argues that while she may have released Providence Hospital and Easterling from liability for a defamatory evaluation offered in good faith, her release should not be construed more broadly as a license to defame her in bad faith, <em>ie., </em>with malice. Appellees, on the other hand, argue that consent is an absolute defense that confers an absolute privilege, and that it is therefore immaterial whether Easterling’s supposedly defamatory statements were made with malice or not. <em>Compare Farrington v.

On the facts of this case, we need not resolve this dispute over the scope and consequence of appellant’s release.

Appellant also argues that the release "con-stitutefd] an unenforceable and unconscionable adhesion contract.” The party seeking to avoid enforcement of a contract on the grounds of unconscionability usually must prove " 'an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.’ ” <em>Urban Invs., Inc. v. Branham, </em><a href="/a2d/464/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="464 A.2d 93" data-case-ids="7944773" data-case-paths="/a2d/464/0093-01">464 A.2d 93</a>, 99 (D.C.1983) (quoting <em>Williams v.

Here appellant has not made any attempt to demonstrate why the terms of the release are unreasonably favorable to Suburban Hospital or appellees, or why this is an "egregious” case where the absence of choice (assuming there was such) should be sufficient to prove unconscionability. <em>See <a href="/f2d/350/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="350 F.2d 445" data-case-ids="3651171,466729" data-case-paths="/f2d/350/0445-01">id.</a> </em>Accordingly, we reject appellant's unconscio-nability argument.</p>
