In the first portion of the trial, the jury found that Saucier had suffered $200,000 in damages due to the negligence of an underin-sured driver. In the second portion of the trial, the jury found that Allstate knowingly misrepresented pertinent facts of its policy provisions relating to Saucier’s un-derinsurance coverage and that Allstate failed to pay an undisputed portion of Saucier’s claim. As a result, the court ordered that Allstate pay to Saucier the per person limit of his underinsurance coverage minus the amount he actually received from the negligent driver’s insurance company,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> interest pursuant to 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2436-A(1)(A),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the amount of the undisputed medical payments claim plus interest pursuant to 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2486(1) <em>&amp; </em>(3),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and costs, disbursements, and attorney’s fees pursuant to 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2436-A(l). Allstate argues that the court erred: (1) in its determination that as a matter of law Allstate was not permitted to offset its coverage by the entire per person limit of the tortfeasor’s coverage; (2) in its denial of Allstate’s motion for judgment as a matter of law that it did not knowingly misrepresent its coverage; (3) in the instructions it gave to the jury; (4) by admitting evidence of Allstate’s offer of $11,000 to Saucier in the second portion of the bifurcated trial; and (5) in its award of attorney fees to Saucier in the amount of $16,731.38. Saucier requests a remand for a determination of additional attorney fees associated with postjudgment proceedings and this appeal. We affirm the judgment and remand for a further determination of attorney fees pursuant to 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2436-A(l).</p>

Saucier’s share of the settlement was $10,594.65. Allstate, Saucier’s insurance carrier, consented to this settlement.</p>
    <p id="b531-6" data-blocks='[["BL_531.6",531,[145,1195,754,941]]]'>[¶4] Saucier’s insurance with Allstate included uninsured motorist coverage with a per person limit of $50,000 and a per accident limit of $100,000. Saucier provided documentation of his medical bills and lost earnings to Allstate. Ultimately Allstate offered Saucier $10,000 in settlement of his claim, indicating that it was compelled to offset his coverage by the $25,000 limit of Pelletier’s per person liability coverage with Progressive and by the $1000 medical payments coverage Saucier had with Allstate. Saucier did not accept this offer, but suggested that it reflected the undisputed portion of his claim and that Allstate should immediately pay that amount. Allstate responded that both the $10,000 and the $1000 were in dispute as it was disputing both damages and coverage.</p>

The trial court denied Allstate’s motion for a summary judgment and declared that pursuant to the terms of Saucier’s policy, Allstate was only able to reduce Saucier’s coverage by the amount he was actually paid by Pelletier, the underinsured motorist. Allstate then made a successful motion for a bifurcated trial in which the jury first determined liability and damages, and then proceeded to the claims regarding Allstate’s failure to pay an undisputed portion of a claim and the knowing misrepresentation of pertinent facts of Allstate’s policy.</p>

Saucier also presented evidence of the damages he incurred as a result of the accident, including approximately $17,000 in medical bills and lost wages because he was unable to continue work as a mill supervisor. He had to find less physically demanding work that paid substantially less. Saucier also presented evidence of his expected future lost wages and medical expenses, which included expenses for continuing physical therapy as well as medications that he would need throughout the course of his life. The jury found that the car accident was the result of Pelletier’s negligence and that Saucier suffered past <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>and prospective damages in the amount of $200,000.</p>

Over Allstate’s objection, Saucier was permitted to introduce evidence of Allstate’s settlement offer of $11,000, which represented the $1000 worth of medical payments coverage (that was not dependent on a finding of liability), and $10,000 worth of uninsured motorist coverage. The jury found that Allstate failed to pay an undisputed portion of Saucier’s claim — the $1000 medical payment benefit, and that Allstate misrepresented pertinent facts of its policy provisions.</p>
