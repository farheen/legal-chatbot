They contend that the Board erroneously refused to consider the licensee’s multiple violations of a voluntary agreement into which the parties had entered in the course of an earlier license renewal proceeding in 1990. We hold that, under applicable regulations, the voluntary agreement legally became part of the license when the license was renewed in 1990, and that the Board therefore committed legal error in failing to take into account the licensee’s violations of that agreement when it decided to renew the license in 1993. Consequently, we reverse the Board’s order.</p>

In 1985 the previous owners sold the store and transferred the license to Samdo, Inc., a corporation jointly owned by Yung Chun Oh and his wife, Byung Hee Oh.

Under the agreement, Trant’s pledged to abide by several conditions on the renewed license. It specifically agreed to refrain from selling half-pints of liquor and single-serving containers of beer and wine; to refuse to sell alcoholic beverages to visibly intoxicated persons; to clean litter from the sidewalk in front of the store and the area around the store; and to take all reasonable steps to stop public drinking and loitering in front of the store. For their part, petitioners agreed to withdraw their protest to the license renewal application; to testify on Trant’s behalf so that the store could obtain zoning variances and thereby expand its retail sales to include grocery items; and to advertise Trant’s business in neighborhood publications free of charge. In addition, the parties agreed that the voluntary agreement “constitutes a condition of the license and that failure to abide by the terms ... will result in revocation of the license.”</p>

As a result, they resumed the practice of selling single-serving containers of beer and wine and half-pints of liquor. Later, in an apparent attempt to validate this practice retroactively, Trant’s filed with the Board a motion to modify the voluntary agreement to allow such sales to take place. In due course, the Board denied the motion. At the end of the healings in the present case, the Board held a very brief, separate proceeding during which “the Board ... determined, with Mr. Oh’s cooperation,” that the Ohs had violated the terms of the voluntary agreement with regard to the types of liquor containers it could sell. As a penalty, the Board suspended Trant’s license for five days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, </em><a href="/a2d/450/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="450 A.2d 412" data-case-ids="7975490" data-case-paths="/a2d/450/0412-01">450 A.2d 412</a>, 413-14 (D.C.1982). If there is substantial evidence to support the Board’s finding, mere evidence contrary to that finding does not permit this court to substitute its judgment for that of the Board. <em>Spevak v. District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, </em><a href="/a2d/407/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="407 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="7975115" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0549-01">407 A.2d 549</a>, 554 (D.C.1979). Moreover, the Board’s conclusions of law must be derived rationally from findings that are in accord with the underlying statute. <em><a href="/a2d/407/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="407 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="7975115" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0549-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/407/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="407 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="7975115" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0549-01">at 553</a>.</p>

I do not agree with my colleagues that the Board’s decision to renew must be reversed because it “ignored” Trant’s violation of a 1990 voluntary agreement made with petitioners. The Board did consider the “licensee’s compliance with the terms of the written agreement”; it did .not prevent protestants from testifying about alleged violations that it considered to rise to the level of statutory standards for renewal; it reserved for the alleged contract violations the procedural vehicle of a show-cause hearing. It initiated a separate proceeding and imposed a five-day suspension of Trant’s license. I see no need for reversal of the renewal order and remand for yet another hearing. As in <em>Spevak, <a href="/a2d/407/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="407 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="7975115" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0549-01">supra,</a> </em>the Board’s solution protects the due process concerns of all participants in the case. <em><a href="/a2d/407/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="407 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="7975115" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0549-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/407/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="407 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="7975115" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0549-01">407 A.2d at 552</a>.
