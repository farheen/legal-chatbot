Following a verbal charge to the jury, the trial court, without objection by Karaffa’s trial counsel, allowed the jurors to deliberate with a written instruction on the elements of unlawful restraint as well as a written definition of reasonable doubt. On March 23, 1994, the jury convicted Karaffa of two counts of rape, indecent assault, making false reports, indecent exposure and conspiracy to commit rape. The court then sentenced Karaffa to a term of imprisonment of a minimum of ten to a maximum of twenty years and subsequently denied post-sentence motions filed by Ka-raffa.</p>

The Superior Court rejected Karaffa’s remaining claims and affirmed his judgment of sentence.

The Commonwealth’s argument, however, misconstrues the fundamental principle of <em>Oleynik </em>that the use of written jury instructions is intrinsically prejudicial and it is this intrinsic, unfair prejudice that requires granting a new trial.

      <a id="p891" href="#p891" data-label="891" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*891</a>The holding of <em>Oleynik </em>and the majority’s position in the instant matter increase the risk, particularly in long and complicated trials, that the jury will be unable to properly apply the law to the facts of the case because it is unable to understand or remember the legal principles enunciated in the oral charge. Jury instructions have become so complex and laden with legalese that they are virtually incomprehensible at times to the average juror. Unless it requests repetition by the court, the jury hears the often obscurely worded instructions once. The jury receives no further legal guidance during its arduous journey towards reaching a verdict. I believe that permitting trial judges to submit written jury instructions could improve jury comprehension and the reliability of verdicts.</p>
    <p id="b927-5" data-blocks='[["BL_927.6",927,[167,1088,755,1183]]]'>Written instructions are highly appropriate to assist jurors who do not understand or accurately recall the trial judge’s instructions after the initial oral presentation by the judge. The majority’s position fails to recognize that jurors do not have perfect memories. There is an invariable risk that jurors will not remember or comprehend the quantity of complex information necessary to make informed and well-reasoned verdicts without the use of some form of written aid. “One of the greatest fictions known to the law is that a jury of twelve laymen can hear a judge read a set of instructions once, then understand them, digest them, and correctly apply them to the facts in the case., It has taken the judge and the lawyers years of study to understand the law as stated in those instructions.” Susan R. Schwaiger, <em>The Submission of Written Instructions and Statutory Language to New York Criminal Juries, </em>56 Brooklyn L.Rev. 1358, 1360 (1991) (quoting Judge Frank Swain, <em>Common Sense in Jury Trials, </em><a href="/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20St.%20B.J.%20405" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="30 Cal.

Nieland, <em>Pattern Jury Instructions: A Critical Look at a Modem Movement to Improve the Jury System, </em>29-30 (1979). Literacy is no longer a primary concern, and modem trials have made exclusive reliance on oral presentation impractical. Further, differences in education and social status always affect the relative roles of jurors, and better-educated jurors are likely to be influential even if the instructions are given orally. It is possible that a juror with a stronger vocabulary would glean more from the oral instruction and become the legal expert of the jury, dominating the deliberation. By contrast, if the jury is provided written instructions in addition to oral instructions, a juror who did not capture a crucial legal concept during the oral presentation can reread the instruction. With oral instructions, a confused juror must either rely on the memory of a fellow juror or persuade the entire jury to approach the court for re-instruction. In <em>Oleynik, </em>this Court adhered to the common law tradition in the face of overwhelming evidence that the concerns that gave rise to that tradition are now obsolete and that a modem set of concerns militate heavily against it.</p>
    <p id="b927-10" data-blocks='[["BL_927.11",927,[966,1495,759,1074]]]'>In <em>Oleynik, </em>this Court suggested that written instructions were likely to mislead the jurors because they would tend to read only part of the instructions, and would attempt to construe the writing on their own rather than returning to the court for further instruction if they had questions. The majority today espouses that written instructions increase the risk that the jury will misinterpret and misapply the law. I believe that these positions are not grounded in sound logic. Realistically, even in straightforward cases, lay jurors will capture only an approximation of the rules of law when those rules are communicated in a single oral presentation. Jurors may misapply the law regardless of whether the instructions are oral or written. It is far more likely that jurors will misunderstand and misapply a complex set of rules told to them one time, than if they have the rules with them during deliberations. Further, jurors’ difficulty with oral instructions has been well documented.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
