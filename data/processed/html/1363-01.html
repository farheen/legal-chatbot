The sentence which relates to contracts which specify an interest rate provides that that rate maintains after entry of judgment.

The statute refers only to the “time from which interest is due” and makes no reference to subsequent variations in the Federal Reserve discount rate. This is consistent with an objective of these amendments to establish a continuing interest rate applicable thereafter to a particular claim without regard to whether the claim is formalized by entry of judgment. Further support for this conclusion is found in the language of Ch. 239 dealing with interest on claims whose interest due date predates April 18, 1980, which reads:</p>

If a claimant is entitled to interest commencing at a particular time or for a certain period of time, it must rest on the premise that interest is due from the commencement of that time. I cannot accept the proposition that interest which is allowed for a period of time preceding an award is due only from the time when the award is made.

Based upon this observation plaintiff contends that Ch. 239 is of use only by analogy or by “borrowing” to determine a reasonable rate of interest where the claim is based on tort, and that the formula legal rate should be applied without reference to limitation which is imposed where interest predates April 18, 1980. The answer to this contention is found within Ch. 239. Initially, it is noted that the interest rate which this Court has utilized has been the legal interest rate. Ch. 239 establishes a legal interest rate formula, but specifies that where the time interest is due predates April 18, 1980 “the legal rate shall remain as it was at such time.” Thus, it specifically preserves the former legal interest rate and excludes the new formula rate with respect to matters where the time from which interest is due predates April 18, 1980. In the face of this legislative exclusion, I find no basis under a process of analogy to apply the new formula rate to the type of situation for which the legislation preserves the former legal interest rate. Similarly, based upon the reasoning stated earlier,-1 find no basis for segmenting interest to apply the new formula rate with respect to interest for the period subsequent to April 18, 1980.</p>
