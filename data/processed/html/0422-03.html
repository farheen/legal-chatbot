Several people were killed, and another suffered serious injuries. The consolidated actions were commenced in the common pleas court in 2001 by Appellees, representatives of the crash 'victims and/or their estates, against Appellants, Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division, Textron, Inc., and AVCO Corporation, as well as others. Appellants were described in the complaints as the “designer, manufacturer, seller, supplier, overhauler, repairer, maintainer, and product support servicer of the Lycoming engine installed on the [accident] aircraft.” Amended Complaints ¶ 10. The complaints asserted identical claims of negligence, strict liability, and breach of express and implied warranties. Appel-lees did not dispute that the original engine assembly was installed on the accident aircraft more than eighteen years before the accident. They alleged, however, that the crash was caused by a failure of engine and fuel system components that were replaced and overhauled within eighteen years of the date of the accident. Further, the complaints averred that Appellants had knowledge of the alleged defects and engaged in intentional misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding relative to them. These sets of allegations were obviously included at least in part to implicate exceptions to GARA’s statute of repose.</p>

As to separability, Appellants argue that motions under GARA are materially distinct from many other motions for summary judgment, in that their subject (the age of an aircraft and the date of its first sale) is separate from and collateral to the underlying controversy in aviation tort litigation, whereas the subjects of most summary judgment motions are inherently intertwined with the merits of the underlying dispute. In terms of the importance element, Appellants invoke the federal policy underlying GARA to ameliorate the impact of long-tail liability on a declining American aviation industry, thus fostering regeneration of essential domestic enterprises, creating employment opportunities for citizens, and favorably affecting the balance of trade between the United States and its trading partners. <em>See generally </em>H.

Appel-lees reject Appellant’s attempt to equate the GARA interest in freedom from liability in tort with assertions of immunity, Speech or Debate Clause challenges, and double jeopardy claims.

As noted, Appellants did also seek to demonstrate that there are no material facts in dispute concerning the application of the misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding exception. Since, however, the common pleas court’s supplemental Rule 1925(a) order has revealed that this argument was not a basis for its decision, and because its resolution will entail a fact-based review of affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials, as opposed to resolution of a central legal controversy, we agree with Appellees’ position that it should not be considered in the present appeal. <em>See Johnson v.

Certain aspects of our decision here reflect a respectful disagreement with the Third Circuit's reasoning, particularly as concerns the weight that our respective courts have attached to the Congressional intent to ameliorate litigation costs (as opposed to merely creating a defense to liability) via a federal statute of repose applicable to the aviation industry. <em>Compare supra </em>at-, 905 A.2d at 433, <em>with Robinson, </em><a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">454 F.3d at 173</a>. Significantly, however, our rationale aligns with other aspects of the Third Circuit’s dispositive reasoning, as the Court of Appeals expressly rested its holding on the fact that the appeal in <em>Robinson </em>did not raise a question of law, but rather, merely represented a challenge the district court's decision that material factual issues were in dispute concerning GARA's misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding exception. <em>See <a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">at 173-74</a>. Here, we have found that the present challenge to the common pleas court’s summary judgment orders centers on dispositive legal issues arising from the court’s opinion; indeed, the common pleas court has not yet made a determination in this case concerning whether there are material facts in dispute regarding the misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding exception.</p>
