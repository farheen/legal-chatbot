The City of Pawtucket Zoning Board of Review (zoning board or board) determined that such a refuse station was not a permitted use under the ordinance, frustrating the plans of the respondent Pawtucket Transfer Operations, LLC (PTO) to construct and operate a large-scale C &amp; D transfer station in Pawtucket. The Superior Court for Providence County, however, reversed the board’s decision. Because we hold that a C &amp; D transfer station is <em>not </em>an authorized use under § 410-12.5(1) of the ordinance, we quash the order of the Superior Court.</p>

See G.L.1956 § 45-24-31(65). The certificate indicated that the property at issue — located at 280 Pine Street, in a manufacturing open zone — was to be used as a “Refuse transfer station.” The certificate said that this use “CONFORM[ED] TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF PAWTUCK-ET, RHODE ISLAND.” Armed with the zoning certificate and moving ahead with its development plans, PTO requested a hearing before the Planning Commission of the City of Pawtucket for site review of its project. However, in a letter dated July 12, 2004, Michael D. Cassidy, director of the Department of Planning and Redevelopment for the City of Pawtucket, advised PTO that he and his office considered the zoning certificate to be invalid because “a private refuse transfer station is not an allowed use under Section 410-[12.5] of the Zoning Ordinance which pertains specifically to ‘public, semi-public, education, and recreation use.’ ” Cassidy wrote that PTO would be required to obtain a use variance from the zoning board to effectuate its request to operate the facility as a refuse transfer station. As a result, Cassidy declined to schedule a site review meeting for PTO.</p>

Specifically, the board concluded that it was not “unreasonable, capricious or arbitrary” for the planning director to conclude that a refuse transfer station had to be wholly or in-part operated or managed by the city to be an authorized use under § 410-12.5(1). The board also found that PTO’s intended use of the property as a C &amp; D transfer station was different from a refuse transfer station, was not listed as an allowable use in the ordinance, and, therefore, was a prohibited use under the zoning code.</p>

The trial justice also found that the board acted arbitrarily when it determined that C &amp; D debris did not meet the definition of refuse, as that term is used in the code. The trial justice subsequently ordered that the case be remanded to the board so that the board could reissue a certificate of zoning compliance to PTO.</p>

PTO argues that the city failed to file a timely petition for certiorari to the Court because it waited nearly three months after the trial justice's order to do so. Although PTO correctly notes that we previously have compared administrative agency and zoning decisions in holding that they are both reviewable by this Court only by petitions for certiorari, we never have applied the time requirements of the former to the latter. Thus, we reject PTO’s argument without further discussion.</p>
