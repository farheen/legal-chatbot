For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the conviction. A summary of the pertinent facts follows.</p>

    <p id="b248-19" data-blocks='[["BL_248.19",248,[1012,1196,750,466]]]'>On the evening of March 31, 1989, a multi-unit tenement building located at 167 Dexter Street, Pawtucket, Rhode Island, was consumed by fire. Two men died after they entered the building to assist others to escape from the fire. After an approximately two-month investigation, defendant was charged by indictment No. P1/89-2038A with two counts of first-degree arson and two counts of felony murder.</p>
    <p id="b248-20" data-blocks='[["BL_248.20",248,[1009,1688,754,1045]],["BL_249.1",249,[151,230,754,225]]]'>The investigation revealed that on the day of the fire, defendant and his girlfriend’s mother, Carolyn Hall (Carolyn), visited the Dexter Street apartment house in search of defendant’s girlfriend, Elena Hall (Elena). The Dexter Street apartment house was apparently known as a “crack house” and was frequented by drug addicts. According to Carolyn, her daughter Elena, with defendant’s help, was then fighting drug addiction. Believing that Elena had relapsed into using drugs, defendant and Carolyn searched several known drug houses and a bar on the day of the fire in an attempt to locate Elena. Prior to entering the Dexter Street building, defendant first made a cursory inspection of G &amp; T Tavern, a bar next door to the Dexter Street apartment house. At apartment No. 8 in the Dexter Street apartment house, tenant Otis Taylor (Taylor) and several acquaintances were freebasing cocaine. Carolyn testified that while she spoke with one of the <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>occupants of apartment No. 8, defendant may have gone into apartment No. 6, a vacant apartment. After determining that Elena was not in the building, defendant and Carolyn left and continued their futile search.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[151,479,753,795]]]'>Later that evening defendant returned to the G &amp; T Tavern and the Dexter Street apartment house with Elena’s sister, Billie Lynn Hall (Billie Lynn), to learn if Elena was present. While Billie Lynn remained in the car, defendant reentered the Dexter Street apartment house and the G &amp; T Tavern next door. According to Billie Lynn, when defendant returned to the car, she smelled gasoline or alcohol on him. Billie Lynn then drove with defendant to one more bar in search of her sister. Approximately five to six minutes later, they drove by the Dexter Street apartment house, which was then on fire. Billie Lynn expressed concern that her sister might be inside the building, but defendant assured her that she was not.</p>
    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[148,1303,753,851]]]'>Later that night defendant found Elena leaving a bar a short distance from the Dexter Street tenement. According to Elena, defendant grabbed her by the arm, walked her to the Dexter Street apartment house, proclaimed responsibility for the fire, and warned that he would burn every building in which she took drugs. On the same evening, defendant also told Maribel Domenech (Do-menech), with whom he and Elena were living, that the next day’s paper would contain a story about a big fire that he had set. The defendant explained to Domenech that he had used gasoline and a match to start the fire. Several days after the fire, defendant told another friend, Jose Azevedo, that he had used' a fighter to burn a blanket in the Dexter Street apartment.</p>
    <p id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[146,2177,756,564]],["BL_249.7",249,[954,231,751,85]]]'>Inspector Donald Byrne (Byrne), a senior fire investigator of the State Fire Marshal’s office, led the investigation of the fire. At trial he testified that he originally focused his attention on apartment No. 8 of the Dexter Street apartment house because of reports that freebasing of cocaine had occurred in the apartment that day and because there was evidence of an explosion in that apartment. After speaking to the occupants of apartment No. 8, however, Byrne refocused his investigation and came to the conclusion that the fire had originated in a mattress in apartment No. 6.</p>
    <p id="b249-10" data-blocks='[["BL_249.8",249,[951,348,754,901]]]'>According to testimony at trial, Cora Lee Shelton (Shelton), who lived in apartment No. 8 of the Dexter Street apartment house with Taylor, was drinking and freebasing cocaine during the afternoon of March 81, 1989. Sometime during the afternoon she went out to do laundry and smelled smoke coming from apartment No. 6. Shelton and Taylor discovered a mattress in apartment No. 6 on fire, and Taylor attempted to douse the fire with water. Shelton proceeded to the “Laundromat,” finished her laundry, and returned to the apartment house. Upon her return she did not smell any smoke, but a short time later when she again left the apartment, she was confronted with intense black smoke in the hallway. Shelton, Taylor, and another friend were forced to jump from the second-floor window to escape the fire.</p>
    <p id="b249-11" data-blocks='[["BL_249.9",249,[948,1280,756,890]]]'>The defendant was tried in Providence County Superior Court in September and October 1990. Prior to trial, the state dismissed the two counts of first-degree arson pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The jury, however, was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts of felony murder, and a mistrial was declared. When the case was retried in October 1991, the jury returned guilty verdicts on the two counts of felony murder. After defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied, defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of fife imprisonment. A timely notice of appeal, however, was not filed. Thereafter, defendant filed a petition for review by common-law discretionary cer-tiorari that we granted on September 17, 1992.</p>

    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[216,344,756,850]]]'>The notes had been compiled by Byrne throughout the investigation and included steps taken in the investigation, names of and statements from potential witnesses, and Byrne’s own observations. In early June 1989, Byrne condensed his notes and the statements from the Pawtucket police and fire departments into a final report. According to Byrne, in accordance with his regular practice, he sifted through his own notes and extracted what he believed to be the relevant facts and information for inclusion in the report. In doing so, Byrne omitted information he deemed irrelevant in order to prevent the report from becoming “muddy.” Thereafter, in accordance with his normal practice and procedure, Byrne destroyed his investigative notes.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[212,1217,755,1091]]]'>Byrne’s final report concluded that the fire was incendiary in nature and had begun in apartment No. 6 of the Dexter Street apartment house. On or about May 25, 1989, however, prior to Byrne’s destruction of his notes, defense counsel learned that Byrne previously had come to the tentative conclusion that the fire had originated in apartment No. 8 — an area to which defendant did not have access. The defendant, in addition to filing a motion for discovery under Rule 16 that sought, <em>inter alia, </em>all results and reports of the fire investigation, also orally moved at the May 25,1989 bail hearing for the preservation and production of Byrne’s investigative notes. At a pretrial hearing, however, Byrne testified that he never received the message to preserve his notes but followed his usual practice of destroying them. Byrne’s final report made no reference to the investigation of apartment No. 8, nor to any tentative conclusion regarding apartment No. 8 as the place of origin of the fire.</p>

At the pretrial hearing defendant argued that the destruction of the possibly exculpatory material violated his right to due process. The defendant also maintained that the state violated its discovery obligations under Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to disclose Byrne’s notes. The trial justice ruled that defendant had not shown that Byrne had destroyed the notes intentionally and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>

The question thus becomes whether they were destroyed in bad faith. According to defendant, the omission from the final report of any reference to the original, tentative conclusion that the fire started in apartment No. 8, should be interpreted as “an attempt to suppress materially exculpatory evidence.” The defendant argued that the exculpatory nature of the notes was apparent from the moment defendant was charged, approximately three weeks prior to the destruction of the notes, and thus “screamed for disclosure under <em>Brady.” </em>In defendant’s view, these factors taken together, irrespective of Byrne’s actual knowledge of defendant’s request to preserve the notes, constituted bad faith.

That police report also contained the preliminary conclusion that the fire had begun in apartment No. 8. Thus, if he <em>were </em>attempting to suppress evidence that exonerated defendant, Byrne could not succeed by merely destroying his <em>own </em>notes. Furthermore, Byrne was steadfast in his conclusion that the fire had begun in apartment No. 6. His final report was intended, <em>inter alia, </em>to demonstrate how he came to this conclusion. In light of this objective, it is amply reasonable to conclude that Byrne attempted to present a clear and concise report and that his omission of any reference to apartment No. 8, rightly or wrongly, was his attempt to keep the report from becoming cluttered with discarded theories.</p>

This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that it was Byrne’s normal practice and procedure to destroy his notes after transposing them into a final report.

The defendant also testified that he does not understand English very well and did not understand most of his conversation with the police detectives or the assistant attorney general.
