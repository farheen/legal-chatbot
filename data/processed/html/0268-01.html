Margolin to substantiate their damages claim. Dr. Margolin testified that the first step in his analysis was to determine when the registration statement would have become effective, assuming a September 20, 2002 filing date. Dr. Margolin acknowledged that, based on his research of other S-3 filings and survey of financial databases, there was no systematically reliable way of determining when such a registration statement would have become effective. Nevertheless, Dr. Margolin did observe that the likelihood of review by the SEC for a repeat S-3 filer in 2002 was approximately 3%.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_56" id="ref_footnote_1_56">56</a> Dr. Margo-lin also observed that Endocare was a repeat S-3 filer and that the S-3 registration it filed on May 15, 2002 became effective within seven business days of that date. He testified that these observations supported a conclusion that a hypothetical Endocare S-3 registration statement relating to the shares owned by BioLife would have become effective within seven business days of filing. Based on this testimony, BioLife asks the court to presume that a registration statement would have been filed on the last day of the 90-day period (September 20, 2002) and would become effective in seven business days (or on October 1, 2002). It then calculates its damages by reference to the highest trading prices on the five trading days beginning on October 1, 2002.</p>

There are several premises for <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>this argument. The first is that Endocare could not have filed the registration statement on or about September 20, 2002 because it was, at that time, engaged in strategic business negotiations with a third party. Endocare’s expert, David Hahn, testified that Endocare could only have filed a registration statement after the discussions with the third party concluded on October 18, 2002. Building on this reasoning, Endocare next argues that no registration statement could ever have become effective because on October 24, 2002, only a few days after the earliest date it could have filed a preliminary registration statement, Endocare began a serious internal audit investigation. Hahn testified that the initiation of that investigation, which raised issues about the reliability of Endo-care’s prior year financial statements, would have required Endocare to withdraw any preliminary filing or, at least, to prevent any such filing from becoming effective, in order to avoid the imposition of civil liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_57" id="ref_footnote_1_57">57</a> Endocare concludes its futility or impossibility defense by pointing out that: (i) within a few weeks of the start of this investigation it delayed the filing of its third-quarter 10-Q, and (ii) NASDAQ halted trading of Endocare stock on December 12, 2002, and eventually delisted the stock as of January 16, 2003.</p>

Because Endocare did not avail itself of the contractual relief mechanism, it is hard pressed in arguing its performance is somehow excused by the factual circumstances that existed at the time its performance was due.

Nevertheless, since the cause of that uncertainty lies in Endocare’s failure to file at all, the court will resolve the question by assuming that it met its obligation on September 20, 2002, the last possible date for filing under the Registration Rights Agreement. As already discussed, BioLife presented the expert testimony of Dr. Margolin, who testified that it was more likely than not that a registration statement would have become effective within seven business days of September 20, 2002.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_60" id="ref_footnote_1_60">60</a> Dr. Margolin relied on his research into the likelihood of SEC review of repeat issuers in 2002 and on the record of a May 2002 Form S-3 filing by Endocare. The court accepts the comparison to the previous filing in determining the likely effective date of the presumed filing. The two filings would have been made by the same issuer, would have been similar with respect to the amount of stock being registered and would have been filed close in time to one another. Thus, for the purpose of calculating damages, the court will hypothesize that BioL-ife would have been able to begin selling its Endocare shares as of October 1, 2002.</p>

The Agreement (or a related contract) limited trading of the shares to a maximum of 25,000 per diem. If BioLife had begun selling its shares on October 1, 2002, it would have taken at least five trading days to sell all of its 120,022 shares-25,000 for the first four days, and 20,022 on the fifth day. Dr. Margolin testified that there was an active market for Endocare shares for the period October 1-7, and Endocare offered no contrary testimony.

Dr. Margolin’s testimony is based on research of the SEC database of full disclosure reviews by the SEC for 1998-2002. He was unable to break down the data by the filings of S-3s, so he used the category of repeat issuers which totaled 715 for the year 2002. He then compared the SEC numbers to a financial database listing of the number of form F and S filings in the year 2002 and deducted the initial filings [S-ls and S-Bs]. Dr. Margolin divided the number of repeat issuers that were reviewed by the number of repeat issuer filings, resulting in a 3% probability that a repeat issuer filing will be reviewed by the SEC in the year 2002.</p>
