After consideration of the parties’ legal memoranda and oral argument by their counsel, we conclude that cause has not been shown and we proceed to summarily decide the timeliness of the defendant’s appeal that is raised by the plaintiffs motion to dismiss.</p>

Following entry of judgment on that verdict, the defendant, on April 30,1997, duly filed his motion for a new trial. The plaintiff responded with objection to the defendant’s new trial motion and also moved for “an additur on damages and liability” and for costs.</p>

On that day following hearing, the trial justice reserved decisions and later, on May 28, 1997, the trial justice, in open court and with all counsel present, denied the defendant’s motion for new trial, the plaintiff’s motion for an additur, and granted in part the plaintiff’s motion for costs. The trial justice’s court clerk, purportedly acting pursuant to Rule 58(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, prepared a Superior Court order form reciting that the defendant’s motion for new trial had been denied. On a separate order form, the denial of plaintiff’s motion for an additur was noted as well as the award of costs in the amount of $2,697.00. Because <a id="p666" href="#p666" data-label="666" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*666</a>we have before us only the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the defendant’s appeal as being untimely, we concern ourselves only with the clerk’s May 28, 1997 order pertaining to the denial of the defendant’s motion for new trial, because, if that order has been properly entered, the defendant’s appeal filed on June 24,1997 would indeed be untimely.</p>

Because of that lack of notice and knowledge, he prepared, on June 4, 1997, an order reciting the trial justice’s denial of the new trial motion and mailed a copy thereof to plaintiffs counsel. After not having received any objection to the proposed order, defendant’s counsel presented the order to the trial justice for entry on June 6, 1997. That order was signed by both the trial justice and the trial justice’s court clerk on June 6,1997, and entered into the case file. Accordingly, on June 6, 1997, there existed two separate identical orders in this case file, each reflecting the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. From which order did the twenty-day appeal time commence to run?</p>
    <p id="b720-12" data-blocks='[["BL_720.13",720,[1014,679,753,370]]]'>We conclude that the twenty-day appeal time commenced to run from the first day following the day when the first <em>valid </em>appealable order was entered. Article I, Rules 4(a) and 20(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See also Friedman v.

Rumore, </em><a href="/f3d/101/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="101 F.3d 20" data-case-ids="7630157" data-case-paths="/f3d/101/0020-01">101 F.3d 20</a> (2nd. Cir.1996). <em>See also Kline v.

However, we conclude from the face of the May 28,1997 order that it had not been <em>properly </em>entered on that date, if in fact it was entered on that date. The order as noted earlier contains no indication of when it was entered. Furthermore, it contains no recitation thereon that it was “entered in open court in the presence of the parties or their counsel,” thereby relieving the trial justice’s court clerk of the necessity of serving notice of the entry of the order by mail, to the defendant or his attorney, as mandated by Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The confusion resulting from the entry in this case of the two separate identical orders, on different dates, could have been easily avoided had the trial justice’s clerk noted on the order whether it had been entered in the presence <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>of the parties or their counsel. Had that been done, the first order would have presumptively been considered to be a valid order pursuant to Rule 58(a). Absent that notation on the first order, however, the mailing of notice required by Rule 77(d) must be complied with in order to provide the order with facial presumptive validity and commence the running of the appellate appeal time.</p>
    <p id="b721-4" data-blocks='[["BL_721.4",721,[199,720,751,420]]]'>Accordingly, on the basis of the case file record before us, the first valid order that was entered in this case was the order entered on June 6, 1997 and the twenty-day time for appeal did not commence to run until June 7, 1997. The defendant’s appeal on June 24, 1997 was therefore within the twenty-day appeal period and thus was timely.</p>
