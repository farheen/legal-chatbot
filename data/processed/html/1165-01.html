The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (trial court) concluded that the Public School Code of 1949 (School Code)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> prohibits such a plan.

On March 18, 1998, at a special meeting, the board of school directors for the Southeast Delco School District (School District)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> adopted the “School Choice Enrollment Stabilization Plan” (Plan<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>) to “provide a tuition scholarship for any student legally residing in the School District who chooses to attend any other public or private school, at which the compulsory attendance requirements of state law may be fulfilled.” (R.R. 27a.) The Plan was to “become effective for the 1998-1999 school year with scholarships in the following amounts: Kindergarten — $250.00; Grades 1-8 — $500.00; Grades 9-12 — $1,000.00.” (R.R. 27a.) However, no scholarship would exceed the amount of actual tuition paid. (R.R. 28a.) The School District estimated the first year maximum cost of the Plan to be $1.2 million and expressly provided that “[i]n no event will the total amount expended for such scholarships exceed the amount of state appropriated funds received by the district.” (R.R. 27a.) The School District further provided that, in future years, the amounts of the scholarships may be increased in accordance with funds available. (R.R. 28a.) The School District would pay the scholarship money at the end of the school year to the student’s parent, after verifying attendance and receiving proof that the tuition was, in fact, paid. (R.R. 28a.) The Plan also provided for reimbursement for a partial year’s attendance on a pro rata basis. (R.R. 28a.)</p>

By decision of October 14, 1998, the trial court disagreed and granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of plaintiffs. (R.R. 80a-90a.) In so ruling, the trial court restricted its inquiry to the School Code, explaining that the constitutional provisions relied on by the School District were not relevant. (R.R. 85a.)

Section 2574 of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 25-2574.

Section 1376 of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 13-1376. It also provides for tuition payments for exceptional students. Section 1372 of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 13-1372. The General assembly also has directed school districts to pay tuition of charter school students. Section 1725-A(a)(2) of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 17-1725-A(a)(2). In light of the many provisions authorizing school districts to pay the tuition of its students attending nondistrict schools, the School Code’s failure to authorize school districts to reimburse tuition directly to parents in the situation presented here evidences an intent not to permit such expenditures.</p>

For example, would section 501 implicitly authorize a school district to pay for birth control for its residents, to offer financial incentives for home-schooling, to give its residents with school-aged children a cash incentive or rebate to move out of the district, or to impose a tax on new residents with minor children to discourage them from moving into the district?</p>

In <em>Rike, </em>a suspended teacher argued that the school board lacked authority to impose any discipline short of dismissal and that the two-thirds vote required for dismissal was required for all forms of discipline. Disagreeing, our supreme court interpreted the School Code’s silence regarding discipline short of dismissal as an indication that the legislature did not intend to require the same procedures for lesser disciplinary actions as it did for dismissals. That is, however, not the same as permitting <em>school </em>boards to take any action upon which the School Code is silent. Rather, in <em>Rike, </em>the court relied upon sections of the School Code empowering school boards to employ teachers and regulate their conduct as inherent authority for the board's action where the School Code was otherwise silent.

(School District’s brief at 21-23.) Because its Plan resulted from an identical concern, the School District argues that its Plan is justified. However, the School District overlooks the fact that in <em>Rhoades </em>our supreme court considered those concerns in the context of upholding the constitutionality of our General Assembly’s amendment of the School Code to provide for free transportation for nonpublic school children. Significantly, the court did not find that the School Code, absent amendment, would have authorized school districts to furnish the free transportation. Indeed, in, cases decided prior to the General Assembly’s amendment of the School Code authorizing school boards to provide free transportation, our supreme court ruled that school boards lacked authority to furnish free transportation to nonpublic school children. <em>See School District of Robinson Township v.

In <em>Wilkinsburg, </em>our supreme court ruled that the trial court erred when it refused to hold an evidentiaiy hearing before granting a preliminary injunction enjoining a school board from hiring a private corporation to run an elementary school. In remanding the case for an evidentiaiy hearing, our supreme court explained that no preliminary injunction may be granted without a hearing because a hearing is essential to determine whether the requirements for a preliminary injunction have been met. The standard of review in that case was the one applicable to review of preliminary injunctions — whether the trial court had reasonable grounds to believe that it was presented with a situation of urgent necessity when it issued the preliminary injunction. It is important to note that the nature of a preliminary injunction is that it is almost always decided by the trial court before the defendant has an opportunity to file an answer to the complaint. Indeed, in <em>Wilkinsburg, </em>the trial court issued the preliminary injunction the day after the complaint in equity and motion for preliminary injunction were filed. Here, in sharp contrast, we are not presented with the issuance of a preliminary injunction, but a decision granting judgment on the pleadings nearly six months after the complaint was filed, after the School District filed an answer with new matter and after all parties, including amicus curiae, filed briefs.</p>

We have not been presented with, nor do we decide, the issue of whether such plans comport with other laws.</p>
