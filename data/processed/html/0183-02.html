Moreover, it maintained that “proof of usable amount is not required to support a conviction under D.C.Code § 33-641.” The latter argument was premised upon four separate criticisms of the usable amount requirement as being: (1) inconsistent with the plain language and legislative history of the relevant statutes, (2) contrary to the overwhelming weight of state and federal authority, (3) difficult to apply, thereby, generating needless litigation, and (4) contrary to the legislative policy of complete suppression of unauthorized possession of controlled substances. These arguments were all new in the sense that they were made for the first time in this court, so far as we can determine, in May 1992, when the government filed its initial brief in No. 91-CF-818. Thus, the arguments were first presented eleven years, and scores of appeals involving the issue, after the applicable statute, the District of Columbia Uniform Con<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>trolled Substances Act of 1981 (“DC-CSA”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> was enacted into law by the Council of the District of Columbia (“Council”).</p>
    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[215,414,759,1669]]]'>The prohibition applicable to these cases makes it “unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.” D.C.Code § 83-541(a)(l). Appellant Thomas was charged with distribution, while appellant Washington was charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. The government contends that <em>any </em>amount of a controlled substance is a violation of this statutory provision, an interpretation which, it asserts, is plain from the law’s terms. We find it puzzling, if the meaning is as clear and as obvious as the government contends it to be, that it has taken this long for this argument to be presented to us. This belated discovery of the statute’s meaning, however, does not estop the government from making the argument because, if we conclude that the Council’s intent was as is contended by the government, we are obligated to apply that intent. What <em>is </em>plain to us is that the terms in the statute are not as crystal clear in their meaning as they are to the government. One may question, for example, whether a substance can even be identified as a “controlled substance,” as defined by the statute, if it is so minute as to escape all measurement. In short, it is not obvious, in our view, that the Council in adopting the DC-CSA, without doubt, intended that any amount of a controlled substance would be sufficient to support a conviction.</p>
    <p id="b244-7" data-blocks='[["BL_244.8",244,[1017,237,756,1853]]]'>Since the meaning is not plain, we will resort, as we ordinarily must, to interpretative techniques that courts find helpful in determining the intent of the legislature. We have identified two applicable principles that appear, at least on the surface, to produce conflicting results. The two interpretative approaches both involve presumptions concerning the meaning of words or terms in a new statute when the same words or terms appear in an already existing statute and have a reasonably settled and understood meaning. One presumption, urged upon us by the government, holds that when the Council enacts, in substance, some existing federal statute, it does so, absent an indication to the contrary, together with any known and settled interpretations of the provisions of that statute by the highest court or courts called upon to interpret it. <em>McReady v. Department of Consumer &amp; Reg.

In addition, in a rough count of the unpublished opinions issued by the court in 1992 and 1993, we found at least six cases in each of those years where we rejected a claim that the government failed to prove a usable amount. In each, the actual quantity of the controlled substance was proven and thus there was a measurable amount.</p>
