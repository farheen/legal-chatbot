They alleged in their complaint that a portion of a defective street light fixture fell on their car, causing an accident which resulted in bodily injury and property damage. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants. We affirm.</p>

Ms. Rajabi was startled and lost control of the car, which ran up onto the curb. As a result of these events, Ms. Rajabi allegedly suffered serious injuries. At that time Pepeo was obligated under a contract with the District of Columbia to replace high-pressure sodium vapor street lamps, such as the ones on Canal Road, once every five years and to clean the fixtures once a year. The same contract required Pepeo to inspect and repair the fixtures while in the process of replacing the lamps.</p>

Since the previous cleaning had been performed in May of 1990, Pepeo scheduled both the cleaning and the replacement of the lamps for May 1991. However, because of budgetary constraints and the low burnout rate observed in a citywide survey, the District asked Pepeo to defer replacement of these street lights until September 1991. Pepeo complied and postponed the cleaning of the light fixtures until the same time.</p>

They claimed that the District and Pepeo were negligent because they had failed to perform an inspection of the street lights within twelve months after the previous inspection, as the maintenance contract required. After a hearing, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants, ruling that appellants had not identified a defect in the light fixture, nor had they offered any evidence to demonstrate that either the District or Pepeo had actual or constructive notice of any such defect or that either of them had deviated from the applicable standard of care.</p>

This argument is without merit. The asserted ambiguity of the contractual language would create an issue of material fact only if it were relevant to determining the District’s or Pepeo’s negligence. We agree with the trial court that, even if the language were construed in appellants’ favor, appellants failed to demonstrate that the contract established a standard of care. Since there was no other evidence from which the jury could determine a standard of care, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment for Pepeo and the District.</p>

Since it is undisputed that they did not have actual notice of the alleged defect,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> appellants would have to prove constructive notice; <em>ie., </em>they would have to show that the light fixture had “remained in an unsafe condition so long that the District authorities [or Pepeo] ought to have known of it, if they had exercised reasonable care.” <em>Jones v.

    <p id="b1380-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1380.9",1380,[992,826,755,996]]]'>Appellants argue that the District and Pepeo would have had notice, actual or constructive, if they had exercised reasonable care by following the twelve-month cleaning schedule outlined in the contract. They contend that the contract established the standard of care, and that the defect would have been discovered if Pepeo had inspected the street lights in May 1991 as originally scheduled. We agree with the trial court that appellants failed to establish, by expert testimony or otherwise, that the maintenance schedule prescribed in the contract (under either interpretation of the language, see note 2, <a href="/us/477/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="477 U.S. 242" data-case-ids="6206897" data-case-paths="/us/477/0242-01">supra)</a> was sufficient to prevent a dangerous condition from developing or that a deviation from the schedule proximately caused the globe to fall.

Whether a particular maintenance schedule for street lights, such as that set forth in a contract, is sufficient to protect passers-by from the hazard of falling light globes is not within the knowledge of the average lay person. Thus expert testimony was required to show that adherence to the schedule set forth in the contract would have prevented the globe from falling on appellants’ car. We <a id="p1323" href="#p1323" data-label="1323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1323</a>hold accordingly that the trial court properly granted summary judgment for the District and Pepeo, since no such expert testimony was presented or proffered, and without it appellants’ case could never have gone to the jury. <em>See Meek v.

In order to hold either defendant liable under <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>appellants must show, among other things, that the light globe was in the exclusive control of one or both defendants and that its sudden fall was unlikely to have occurred in the absence of negligence. <em>See Hackett, <a href="/a2d/264/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="264 A.2d 298" data-case-ids="8068522" data-case-paths="/a2d/264/0298-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/264/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="264 A.2d 298" data-case-ids="8068522" data-case-paths="/a2d/264/0298-01">264 A.2d at 300</a>.
