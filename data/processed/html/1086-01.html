The two pinions mesh with a gear fixed on the main driven shaft, and thus power from each of the operating units is transmitted to this shaft.

    <p id="b538-10" data-blocks='[["BL_538.11",538,[249,597,1321,193]]]'>Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 24, and 25 were rejected on the patents to Mackenzie-Kennedy, No. 137078 and Boothroyd, et al No. 103444. With reference to these claims and the references the Board of Appeals, in part, said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b538-11" data-blocks='[["BL_538.12",538,[244,817,1326,1453]]]'>* * ■ * Most of the claims are met literally unless special weight be attached to the expression “ definite phase relation ” and the element included in some of the claims as “ a flexible coupling.” As previously pointed out the expression “ definite phase relation ” is not employed in the specification and its significance is not clear. It apparently is intended to describe a desirable characteristic of operation of a power plant made up of a plurality of internal combustion engines but the expression itself does not import any structure into the claims. Touching the other limitation mentioned, that of “ a flexible coupling,” we would say that a spring-pressed clutch such as disclosed by the reference would ordinarily be described as “a flexible coupling.” There is no structural limitation in the claims of the group under consideration defining the flexible coupling and distinguishing from the reference construction. There is some criticism of the reference because the power plant is light being primarily intended to drive aircraft. , We do not think this criticism is entitled to much weight but in any event it can not be urged against another reference relied on against other claims. We refer to the British patent to Boothroyd et al No. 163444. It is stated in the specification of this patent that the power plant disclosed may be used for marine work. The arrangement of driven shaft, gearing, internal-combustion engine units and location of flexible connections between engine crank shafts and the short shafts carrying the driving gears is the same in this last noted British patent as it is in appellant’s case. Even the type of gears employed is the same, i. e., double-helical type. The British patent No. 103444 discloses clutches between the crank shafts of the various internal-combustion engines and the short shafts carrying the driving gears which are said to be of the combined friction and positive-engagement type. Broadly, we think these clutches constitute flexible couplings. Some of the claims of the group under consideration refer to axial adjustment or movement of one of the gears. Claims 24 and 25 include means for preventing longitudinal movement of the crank shafts. This last noted limitation seems to define an ordinary construction. With respect to the limitation as to axial adjustment this is -not a structural limitation and is not sufficiently definite to justif yan allowance of the claims. Claim 2 is not met by the British patent No. 137078. Referring to figure 5 there is no disclosure of crank shafts in alignment, with a gear thereon meshing with a gear on the driven shaft. This feature, however, is shown in British patent No. 103444.</blockquote>

In rejecting these claims the examiner referred to several of the references hereinbefore cited, as showing the general arrangement of the units. The patent to Curtis was cited to show that it was old in the art to “ control the fuel for a multiple system.” In affirming the decision of the examiner in rejecting these claims, the Board of Appeals said:</p>

They were rejected by the examiner on “ Dodge, Surcouf, Parsons, Kennedy, or Balanced-Engine Syndicate, 120227, in view of the speed control shown by Schoonmaker. In Schoonmaker the engine may be reversed, controlled by hand or by a governor. No invention is <a id="p1090" href="#p1090" data-label="1090" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1090</a>involved in placing such a control on structure shown in first group of references.”</p>
    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[220,351,1321,85]]]'>The Board of Appeals sustained the examiner, holding that the claims were uninventive over the references cited.</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[217,450,1324,238]]]'>Claim 17 was rejected on the British patent to Bbothroyd et al., No. 103444, in view of the patent to Kuentzel and the British patent to Mackenzie-Kennedy, No. 137078. The Board of Appeals concluded its opinion with 'the following observation relative to this claim:</p>
    <blockquote id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[220,721,1321,283]]]'>* * * So far as the claim recites structure it is not patentably distinguished from the British reference No. 103444 alone. The clutch of the reference, broadly stated, is a flexible coupling and the gears disclosed are herringbone gears. In any event the Kuentzel United States patent shows a flexible shaft coupling of the same type as that employed by appellant. It would not, in our opinion, require invention to substitute for the clutches of the British patent No. 103444, a coupling like that shown by Kuentzel.</blockquote>
    <p id="b540-8" data-blocks='[["BL_540.7",540,[219,1029,1322,595]]]'>Although it is declared by counsel for appellant that the structure shown in the application is the first successful power plant involving a plurality of oil engines, it is conceded that appellant was not the first to conceive a power plant of the type involved. In view of the disclosures in the references, we are unable to hold that the alleged novel combinations of elements shown and claimed in appellant’s application involve invention. In view of the fact that the tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the appealed claims did not involve invention, this court ought not to reverse the decision of the Board of Appeals, unless it is made to appear that the decision is manifestly wrong. We are not satisfied that the board erred in rejecting the appealed claims. Its decision is, therefore, <em>affirmed.</em>
