Ap-pellee sought medical treatment and underwent spinal decompression and fusion surgeries in 1988 and 1989, but he still suffered back and leg pain. In July of 1990, Appellee was referred to Appellant, who specialized in spinal surgeries. In July of 1990, Appellant performed spinal decompression surgery on Appellee.</p>

These options included: removal of the plates and screws with implantation of new plates and screws; an interbody fusion; an anterior fusion; or the implantation of a bone growth stimulator. Appel-lee testified he informed Appellant of his desire to have the pedicle screws and plates removed, feeling that they were the source of the increased pain.</p>

N.T. Trial, 03/08/1999, at 107. Prior to the 1993 surgery, Appellant discussed consent-to-surgery forms with Appellee. Appellee questioned the language in the consent forms that referenced implanting plates and screws. Appellee testified that Appellant assured him the only implantation that would be considered was a bone growth stimulator. N.T. Trial, 03/08/1999, at 112.

The case proceeded to a jury trial March 8, 1999, before the Honorable Gary S. Glazer. The trial was held over five days, from March 8, 1999 to March 12,1999.

Were we to quash an appeal from an order which, except for the entry of judgment, is otherwise final, we would expend judicial resources in the decision to quash, one of the parties would inevitably praecipe the prothonotary to enter judgment, and a subsequent appeal would be permitted to follow.” <em>Id. </em>at 1367 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>

Judge Bechtle’s order was not violated by the trial court permitting cross-examination regarding Appellant’s financial interest in AeroMed. First, the order does not in any form prohibit the offering of evidence; it prohibits certain claims. Second, the language clearly permits claims of medical malpractice and lack of informed consent, which are the issues in the instant case. Next, the order only prohibits the assertion of claims that have as an essential element a financial relationship between the physician and AeroMed. However, this case is a medical malpractice and lack of informed consent action that does not require proof of a financial interest as an essential element. <em>See Rauch v.
