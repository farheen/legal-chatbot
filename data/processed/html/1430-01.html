The shells are approximately two inches in diameter and about one-half inch in depth. One contains the rheostat which is operated by means of a rotatable knob on the outside of said shell. The shaft upon which the knob is mounted extends through the shell, the inner end of said shaft being positioned centrally with respect to the circular resistance element of the rheostat; upon the inner end of this shaft is mounted an arm which extends radially toward the periphery of said shell. The end of the arm contacts the circular resistance element which abuts the inner wall of the shell. Upon said arm there is an ear engageable with a toggle which protrudes from the other shell, which toggle is a part of the snap switch mechanism contained therein. The other bakelite shell, containing the snap switch mechanism, has its open side covered with a brass plate, fastened to the shell with three screws. The plate has an opening through which protrudes the aforementioned toggle. This shell has openings cut in its circumferential area so that the working of the switch may be observed. The two shells are held together with a fibre strap.</p>

A line is drawn boxing off this writing, and the balance of the page is filled with a portion of the description of the drawings of the device which appear on the following page. In handwriting appears “Wed. Apr. 18-28.” This description is written in very small, but perfectly clear and very carefully worded language. It does not resemble the writing at the top of the page. The second page of the said exhibit has the same general appearance. On the top is printed “Wednesday, April 18, 1928.” Immediately beneath this there are five or six lines of handwriting of ordinary size. Directly underneath appear the two very complete figures showing the device of 1928 in full size of Exhibit 4, and the balance of the page is filled Avith a continuation of the description started on the first page of the exhibit, in the same small, clear writing.

Four witnesses,-among whom was the wife of appellee, all testified that they had seen the drawings in the diary in the spring of 1928. Several of these witnesses testified that there was in the diary a written description of the drawings. Another witness testified that he saw the drawings and description in the diary during May, 1930. As far as the record shows, we cannot say that the tribunals below erred in holding that there has been sufficient corroborating evidence to establish that appellee made his drawings and written description, which are adequate to meet the counts, on April 18, 1928.</p>

    <p id="b751-12" data-blocks='[["BL_751.12",751,[98,2155,1325,284]]]'>It was testified that after the original device had been on the radio of appellee for several months it was brought to the factory and given a life test on a machine in the variable high resistance department. It was said to be an extended test, the switch, it was said, having been operated about 24,500 times; a number of witnesses testified as to this test.</p>

    <p id="b752-4" data-blocks='[["BL_752.5",752,[224,670,1327,445]]]'>We are frank to say that we are not impressed with appellee’s exhibits consisting of alleged diary entries. However, under the well-established rule, we are not warranted in overturning concurring decisions of the Patent Office tribunals on questions of fact in the absence of manifest error; and, on the record before us, we can not say that there is manifest error in such decisions. Accordingly the holding of the tribunals below that appellee reduced the involved invention to practice at least as early as the summer of 1928 will not be disturbed by us.</p>
    <p id="b752-5" data-blocks='[["BL_752.6",752,[222,1121,1327,234]]]'>Appellants contend that the brass plate, before-mentioned in Exhibit 1, is not a “cover member for said resistance varying device,” and that the Board of Appeals erred in finding that the involved counts do not require the cover member to be a tie member between such device and the switch.</p>
    <p id="b752-6" data-blocks='[["BL_752.7",752,[219,1369,1328,644]]]'>There is no limitation in the counts that the cover member is a tie member, as contended by appellants; therefore their contention in this respect falls. As to the brass plate, identified in the drawing by the number 15, appellee sets out in his written description, Exhibit 1, that “The metal plate 15 forms a cover for the rheostat housed in shell 18 and also forms a partition separating the switch mechanism from the rheostat.” There cannot be any doubt that the metal plate 15 covers the rheostat when the device is assembled. We think it is immaterial whether the said metallic' cover is attached to the rheostat shell prior to assembly of the device or not. It is a metal plate; it functions as, and is, a cover for the rheostat. Accordingly we find no error in the holding of the board that the metal plate 15 satisfies the requirement of the counts.</p>
    <p id="b752-7" data-blocks='[["BL_752.8",752,[218,2018,1320,194]]]'>Appellants also contend that appellee derived the invention from them, and was spurred into activity by knowledge of their device, and further that the record shows that the device of 1928 was abandoned, or suppressed and concealed.</p>
    <p id="b752-8" data-blocks='[["BL_752.9",752,[215,2217,1323,236]]]'>The Examiner of Interferences and the board held that the life of the device was tested in 1929, and that the record shows that the possibility of commercial production was discussed in 1930. Some support can be found in the record for the following statement of the examiner:</p>
    <blockquote id="b753-2" data-blocks='[["BL_753.3",753,[98,265,1323,199]]]'>
      <a id="p1435" href="#p1435" data-label="1435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1435</a>* * * If inactivity is to deprive a party of the reduction to practice to which he is otherwise entitled such inactivity must he shown to be due to dissatisfaction with the device. In the present instance this is not the ease. Sehellenger never abandoned the idea of making the device commercially but delayed due to the pressure of work and to poor health.</blockquote>
    <p id="b753-3" data-blocks='[["BL_753.4",753,[95,489,1327,446]]]'>It is not disputed that appellee saw the device of appellants sometime in April 1931. The record for appellee, however, contains some evidence tending to show that it was appellee’s intention throughout 1930 to go into commercial production of his device, and the testimony of the two workmen who did the work on the development of the switch is some evidence that this work was done in February 1931, which is several months prior to April 1931. This work was held to be the final stage of appellee’s activity which ended in commercial production.</p>
    <p id="b753-4" data-blocks='[["BL_753.5",753,[141,943,360,33]]]'>The board stated:</p>

The record clearly shows that Sehellenger was in possession of the invention as broadly covered by counts 2 and 3 long prior to Meuer and Stevens’ alleged conception and, moreover, the record shows that Sehellenger entered into the final stages of activity which led to commercialization prior to the date on which he is claimed to have had knowledge of the Meuer and Stevens device. * * *</blockquote>
    <p id="b753-6" data-blocks='[["BL_753.7",753,[95,1363,1326,345]]]'>It is further contended by appellants that since the decision of the board held that the evidence was insufficient to award priority of invention to appellee with respect to counts 1 and 4, it follows that there was “no evidence upon which to credit appellee with original work on the device in issue following the alleged 1928 and 1929 work and preceding the time at which appellee now admits that he procured a specimen of appellants’ device, to-wit, April, 1931.”</p>
    <p id="b753-7" data-blocks='[["BL_753.8",753,[94,1715,1326,543]]]'>We think this reasoning of the above contention to be fallacious. Both the Examiner of Interferences and the board held that appel-lee’s exhibits did not disclose a “stamped sheet metal cover member” and “a relatively shallow recessed molded insulating base,” as required by count 4. With respect to count 1 it was held that the proof of appellee failed to meet the terms of said count since “the walls of the recess are not formed to limit the movement of both the actuator and contactor, as required by the count,” as stated by the Examiner of Interferences. These are limitations not contained in counts 2 and 3 and the situation is that they were not met by ap-pellee’s proof.</p>
