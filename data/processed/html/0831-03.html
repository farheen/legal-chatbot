PURPA mandates that states create legal mechanisms to compel regulated electric utilities to purchase needed power from such sources instead of building additional capacity or acquiring power from other regulated utilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has promulgated regulations under PURPA <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 C.F.R. § 292.101">18 C.F.R. § 292.101</a> et seq.

Needs during the ten-year period commencing with the spring of 1991 were examined. Based on the record of those hearings, the PUC determined that PECO would need approximately one hundred sixty megawatts of additional capacity by the year 2000.</p>
    <p id="b911-7" data-blocks='[["BL_911.7",911,[175,1512,754,797]]]'>The PUC assigned priorities to the competing QFs based on the extent of their development, the quality of existing utility service in their locales, the viability of the various proposals, and the sequence in which the QFs filed their petitions with the PUC. PECO was then directed to enter long-term purchase agreements with two of the QFs, namely LG &amp; E Energy Systems, Inc. (LG &amp; E) and American Power Corporation/CMS Generation Company (American/CMS). LG &amp; E and Ameriean/CMS were to provide eighty megawatts of capacity apiece.

PECO contends that developments after publication of the 1991 ARP substantially reduced or eliminated the need for additional capacity. Such developments were described in PECO’s 1992 ARP, which was filed in the spring of 1992 after proceedings to determine PECO’s energy needs had commenced. The PUC declined, however, to consider the 1992 ARP, reasoning that capacity needs were to be determined as of the time when proceedings were initiated, namely, the spring of 1991.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> PECO claims that the PUC, <a id="p834" href="#p834" data-label="834" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*834</a>by ignoring the 1992 ARP and other post-1991 evidence of reduced capacity needs, grossly overestimated the need for additional capacity.
