The Girons’ claim against Bailey emanates from Caye-tano’s<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> fall from a second-floor porch to the street after the porch railing collapsed. The parties appeared for oral argument on November 3, 2009, pursuant to an order of this Court ordering them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>

Cayetano called out for Jill to answer the phone, but she did not respond. Cayetano then walked onto porch to see if Jill was either on the porch or in the street below. After taking four steps, Cayetano’s foot sank into the soft-wooden floorboards. He tripped, lost his balance, and fell forward toward the right porch railing. He had the telephone in one hand, and he reached out for the porch railing with his free hand in an attempt to break his fall. Unfortunately, the porch railing broke free from the columns to which it had been attached, and Cayetano plunged from the second floor onto the sidewalk below; the railing crashed to the ground with him.</p>

She described the wooden porch as “a little lopped,” and although she sat on the porch occasionally, she never went near the front railings, preferring to sit just to the right of the porch door. She said that Marshall told her that he planned to construct a new second-floor porch, but no new porch ever was built. Charles Norris, the third-floor tenant, frequently used the porch, and he agreed that some parts of the wooden floor were rotted and in need of repair. Cayetano never went on the porch prior to the day of his fall.</p>

The couch was lifted from the street and hoisted over the second-floor porch railing. During that process, it came into contact with the middle section of the railing.

Marshall came to the house that night. Marshall testified that from the street he observed that the right railing, the same raffing that Cayetano later would fall through, and not the middle railing struck by the couch, “looked loose,” but that it remained attached to the columns. When Marshall took another look at the right raffing from the second floor, he thought that the railing looked bent, not loose. He said that he told Robin to stay off the porch and also said that he locked the porch door with a deadbolt. He conceded, however, that he did not put up any warning tape and that the deadbolt could <a id="p1006" href="#p1006" data-label="1006" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1006</a>be unlocked from the inside without using a key.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b1042-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1042.5",1042,[208,951,749,604]]]'>The day after Cayetano’s misfortune, Robin telephoned Marshall to report the fall. Robin also took photographs of the missing right porch railing, the previously damaged middle porch railing, and the porch floorboards. Later that day, Marshall came to the house and nailed the porch door shut. At that time, he also told Robin and Charles Norris to stay off the porch. At a later point in time, Marshall replaced all the metal porch railings with railings made of wood.</p>

Robin, Jane, Robin’s daughter Jill Jones, Marshall, and Cayetano all were called to testify during plaintiffs’ case. Although he did not appear personally, portions of Charles Norris’s deposition transcript were read into the record. The Girons also introduced photographs of the second-floor porch, taken the day after Cayetano’s fall. Jane Bailey offered no witnesses.</p>

The trial justice determined that either the accounts of Robin or Charles Norris’s deposition testimony that a couch damaged the middle railing and Marshall was notified about it, or Marshall’s testi<a id="p1007" href="#p1007" data-label="1007" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1007</a>mony that the right railing was loose or bent, provided sufficient evidence of negligence to survive a Rule 50 motion. She reasoned further that Jane, through her agent Marshall, was on notice of a dangerous condition on the property; specifically, that the porch railings were bent or had become detached as a result of minimal contact, and she failed to take any action to either repair the dangerous condition or warn her tenants of its existence. According to the trial justice, “[t]he jury wouldn’t be speculating, they’d be drawing the reasonable inference that this was a damaged railing.”</p>
    <p id="b1043-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1043.4",1043,[112,1089,754,505]]]'>The jury found that Jane Bailey breached her duty to the Girons, and that this breach was the proximate cause of Cayeta-no’s injuries.

As grounds, Bailey argues that expert testimony was required to determine if the railing was defective, and if so, whether that defect was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s fall. Bailey argues that it was not within the jury’s common knowledge or experience to determine the cause of the railing’s failure. The Girons ask this Court to affirm the denial of Bailey’s Rule 50 motion because the trial justice correctly ruled that expert testimony was not required because there “was substantial, reliable and probative [evidence] for the jury to find, without expert testimony, that Jane Bailey was negligent.”</p>

That is, in addition to a landlord’s statutory duty to make repairs and do whatever is necessary to maintain the premises in a fit and habitable condition, the landlord has an obligation to exercise reasonable care for the safety of those expected to be on the premises and to protect against dangerous conditions existing on the premises. <em>See Tancrelle, </em><a href="/a2d/756/0744-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="756 A.2d 744" data-case-ids="11243906" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/0744-01">756 A.2d at 752</a> (summarizing landowners duty to those reasonably expected to be on the premises); <em>Errico, </em><a href="/a2d/713/0791-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="713 A.2d 791" data-case-ids="11821143" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/0791-01">713 A.2d at 794</a> (determining that the act displaces only those common law rules in conflict with the act’s provisions).</p>

Jane had constructive notice of the deteriorating condition of the railing and the porch floor because Marshall, her agent, had actual notice of both.

Significantly, they emphasize that an abundance of evidence supporting Bailey’s negligence exists beyond the fitness of the railing itself, including the rotted porch floor and the failure to repair this condition or to warn the tenants about this condition, all of which contributed directly to Cayetano’s losing his footing, his subsequent fall into the railing, and ultimately, his fall to the sidewalk.</p>

Cayetano’s stumble on the poorly maintained porch floor caused him to be propelled to the railing. He grasped the railing with one hand in an attempt to halt his fall, but the railing did not support him. The existence of defects in the railing and the floor, Bailey’s awareness of them, and the failure to sufficiently protect or warn Cayetano about these conditions, is more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Bailey’s breach of her duty was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s injuries. On these facts, the jury was not speculating about whether the defendant’s breach of her duty was the proximate cause; there was sufficient evidence of causation and expert testimony was not required.</p>

However, her reliance on <em>DeOliveira </em>is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff, a painter, was unable to remember how he fell from a second floor balcony while painting a condominium’s exterior, and he could not demonstrate that the landowners had any prior notice about defective rail conditions. <em><a href="/citations/?q=939%20A.2d%202" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="939 A.2d 2">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=939%20A.2d%202" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="939 A.2d 2">at 6-7</a>. The <em>DeOliveira </em>court upheld the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff failed to establish any connection between an alleged defect in the guardrail and the plaintiff's injury. <em><a href="/citations/?q=939%20A.2d%202" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="939 A.2d 2">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=939%20A.2d%202" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="939 A.2d 2">at 8</a>. Here, however, plaintiffs have introduced evidence about the condition of the railing and porch, about defendant's notice of those conditions, and of causation between those conditions and Cay-etano’s fall from the porch.</p>
