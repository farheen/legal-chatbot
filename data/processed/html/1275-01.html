The master found that Dalrymple is entitled to equitable reimbursement for a percentage of Premco’s value, and the trial court adjusted that amount downward.

The court also found that Kilishek’s conduct resulted in a significant increase in Dalrymple’s litigation costs. Moreover, Dalrymple’s father was not under any binding obligation to continue to pay Dalrymple’s ballooning legal expenses. The record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard. N.T., 9/12/01, at 49-52; N.T., 12/12/01, at 102-110,175-176.</p>

Kilishek cites, for ex<a id="p1282" href="#p1282" data-label="1282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1282</a>ample, the possibility that he would have to substantiate a dinner expense by revealing the client he ate with and the business that they discussed. Kilishek’s argument is anecdotal, and does not explain his failure to produce an apparently substantial amount of documentation, even in redacted form. The record supports the trial court’s finding that Kilishek’s unjustified failure to provide necessary discovery resulted in additional litigation costs to Dal-rymple. Moreover, Kilishek’s brief makes no legal argument to support his theory that some of the requested documents were not a proper subject of discovery. Kilishek’s argument fails.</p>

In <em>Wang, </em>the wife put her own career on hold and helped the husband achieve his goal of becoming an oncologist, thus resulting in a dramatic difference in earning capacity. The wife had a master’s degree and supported the family for a period of time when husband earned little money, then gave up her career to support the family.
