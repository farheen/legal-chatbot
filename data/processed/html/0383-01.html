Claimant sustained a work-related injury to his low back, ribs and legs when lifting a dryer on December 19, 1989 for which he received benefits. On July 26,1991, Employer filed a Termination Petition alleging Claimant was fully recovered from his work injury as of June 6, 1991. On December 31, 1991, Employer’s request for supersedeas was granted. On November 12, 1992, Claimant filed a Petition for Reinstatement of Compensation on the basis that the Judge had improperly refused to reopen the record despite Claimant’s having secured a new attorney and having scheduled Claimant’s deposition.</p>

The Claimant, Earl Sherrod, suffered an injury to his low back, ribs and legs in the course and scope of his employment as a maintenance man on December 19, 1989. Defendant accepted the injury and began paying wage loss compensation at the rate of $162.00 based on an average weekly wage of $180.00.</blockquote>

Ruth, which the Court finds to be self-serving, unconvincing and not credible. Dr. Ruth began treating Mr. Sherrod in April, 1990 and, between his office visits and referrals to his owned Central Rehabilitation, by far the greatest item of medical expense. Despite these many thousands of dollars worth of medical treatment, Mr. Sherrod appears not to have benefited from it at all.</blockquote>
