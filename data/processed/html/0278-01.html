(J &amp; L), appeals from the September 17, 1990 order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County reversing a decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh (Board) that granted use and dimensional variances to J &amp; L for construction of a public parking lot in a residential zone in the City. Issues raised on appeal are whether the Board committed an abuse of discretion or an error of law in granting the variances; and whether the trial court exceeded its scope of review in reversing the Board’s decision.</p>

In April 1989, J &amp; L filed an application for occupancy permit and/or building permit with the zoning administrator in which J &amp; L sought to construct on the property a 188-space parking lot, which was to serve primarily as an employee parking lot for Orbital Engineering, a business affiliated with J &amp; L and located approximately two blocks from the property. The lot was also to provide parking for those attending events at the nearby Civic Arena.</p>
    <p id="b339-13" data-blocks='[["BL_339.13",339,[982,235,750,804]]]'>Pursuant to the City’s zoning ordinance, public parking facilities are not permitted in an R-4 district and J &amp; L therefore required a use variance to construct the parking lot for its intended purpose. The zoning ordinance provides however that “community parking lots,” which must be used exclusively by residents of the neighborhood for parking of non-commercial vehicles, are a permitted use in an R-4 district. J &amp; L also sought the following dimensional variances: front and rear yards of five feet instead of the required twenty-five feet; five-foot side yards abutting the street instead of twenty-five feet; and a five-foot side yard not abutting the street instead of twenty feet. The zoning administrator denied J &amp; L’s application.</p>
    <p id="b339-14" data-blocks='[["BL_339.14",339,[977,1065,753,753]]]'>On appeal to the Board, J &amp; L argued that strict application of the zoning ordinance would result in an unnecessary hardship and would deprive it of reasonable use of the property, that the parking lot would be the most appropriate use of the land, and that J &amp; L had been unable to attract a development project permitted in the area. The Hill District Project Area Committee, Inc. (Committee), as well as several neighbors and the Department of Housing/Urban Redevelopment Authority, intervened and objected to the proposal, arguing that it would be a detriment to the health, safety, and welfare of the community and that it would negatively affect redevelopment plans for the area.</p>

The Board concluded that J &amp; L met the burden of proof necessary for the requested variances because the proposed use of the property as a parking lot to be used by the general public instead of by residents of the neighborhood would not have a detrimental effect on public welfare; and because of J &amp; L’s purported inability to attract a development project for the property. The Board granted the variances subject to conditions which included a ten-foot buffer zone at cer<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>tain portions of the parking lot where it would abut residential structures located on Colwell and Vine Streets.</p>
