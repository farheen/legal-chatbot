There was no dispute that Dr. Blum, Dr. Spiegel, and Dr. Anne were all board certified by different boards. <em>See infra. </em>There is also no dispute that certification by the same or a similar board is the general rule promulgated in subsection 512(c)(3); however, the final phrase of this subsection provides for an exception, set forth in subsection 512(e), which the trial court did not appear to recognize. Under the exception, a court may waive the same board certification and same specialty requirements if the court determines that the expert possesses “sufficient training, experience and knowledge” to testify as to standard of care “as a result of active involvement in ... medicine in the applicable subspecialty or a related field of medicine.” 40 P.S. § 1303.512(e).</p>

It is of utmost importance to stress that such a competency determination can be made only after delineation of precisely what is the specific care at issue and after consideration of what testimony the expert will render. With this caveat in mind, and to be absolutely clear, we reiterate what this case is not about: There is no allegation that Dr. Spiegel breached the applicable standard of care in his performance of Mrs. Vicari’s surgery to resect the tumor, nor is there any allegation that Dr. Anne breached the applicable standard of care in her administration of radiation therapy to Mrs. Vieari. The sole issue is whether the standard of care applicable to Drs, Spiegel and Anne included the requirement to offer Mrs. Vieari the option of follow-up chemotherapy and to refer her to a medical oncologist for this purpose. Concerning this narrow question, we conclude that Dr. Blum was well qualified, under Section 512 of the MCARE Act, to testify as to his opinion even though he was board certified by a different board and practiced in a different subspecialty than the defendant physicians.</p>

The statute does not define the term “related field of medicine.” However, in the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court in <em>Gbur, </em>Justice Saylor did consider, albeit in <em>dicta, </em>the meaning of this phrase in the context of subsection 512(e), and suggested that it “must mean more than fields of medicine which are ‘related’ in the most generic sense of the word, since Section 512(e) serves as a component of reform legislation designed to meaningfully enhance the standards governing the admissibility of expert testimony in medical professional liability eases.” <em>Gbur, supra </em>at 459 (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court). Justice Saylor continued his interpretation as follows: “[T]he statute should be read to require a close enough relation between the overall training, experience, and practices of the expert and that of the defendant-physician to assure the witness’s expertise would necessarily extend to standards of care pertaining in the defendant-physician’s field.” <em>Id. </em>Here, we expressly adopt the above two statements from <em>Gbur’s </em>opinion announcing the judg<a id="p1284" href="#p1284" data-label="1284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1284</a>ment of the court as explicative of subsection 512(e).</p>

Two fields of medicine may be “related” with respect to certain specific issues of care, but unrelated with respect to other specific issues of care. Determining whether one field of medicine is “related” to another with respect to a specific issue of care is likely to require a supporting evidentiary record and questioning of the proffered expert during <em>voir dire. </em>This interpretation of “related field of medicine” is most compatible with the text of subsection 512(e) as a whole, which sets forth an exception to the formal same specialty and same board certification rules for experts otherwise qualified to testify.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Given the complex and multidisciplinary nature of many treatment regimens, consensus decisions as to the care of individual cancer patients are often reached by a multi-disciplinary panel of physicians known as a “tumor board,” the composition and activities of which were explored at trial. As Dr. Blum’s undisputed testimony made clear, patients in accredited cancer centers are routinely reviewed by a “tumor board,” which consists of physicians from a variety of specialties and subspecialties, including medicine, surgery, diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, and pathology.

First, as the Majority states, appellee’s evidence amply established that as a medical oncologist Dr. Blum was qualified under Section 512(e) of the MCARE Act to render an opinion on the standard of care applicable to cancer treatment in the decedent’s case. The MCARE Act obviously was designed to raise the bar for expert witness qualification in medical negligence cases. But the Act should not supplant common sense or the dictates of justice. Indeed, in my view, the Act cannot simply displace the trial court’s evidentiary gate-keeping role such that traditional jurisprudential rules regarding the admissibility of expert witness testimony, deriving from bedrock precepts involving relevance and the overall truth-determining process, no longer apply. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa.R.E. 702 (witness qualified as expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify in form of opinion); <em>Miller v.

Section 512(e) states that the trial court “may” waive the MCARE Act’s same specialty and board certification requirements if the court determines that the expert qualifies under the multiple parameters the provision then lists. The statute does not say the court “must” admit such testimony, only that it “may.” The question then becomes by what standard should that power be exercised? The Majority here does not remand for the trial court to exercise the power so conferred; instead, we hold, as a matter of law, that there is only one permissible ruling: the expert qualifies and must be permitted to testify. Does this ruling square with the language of the statute, or would the import of the statute, if deemed controlling, require a remand and a possible contrary conclusion? For my part, the answer is not in the MCARE Act, but in principles of jurisprudence: absent some competing concern <em>(e.g., </em>cumulative testimony) where an expert so qualifies, not only would it be an abuse of discretion, it would be plain error not to permit the testimony.</p>

Even if the waiver argument were deemed available to appellants, I would find it lacks merit. Appellants claim that appellee waited too long' — until post-trial motions — to argue that appellants waived their challenge to Dr. Blum's qualifications. Ordinarily, if trial error is not raised by a litigant until post-trial filings, the claim is waived. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.1(b)(1) (post-trial relief may not be granted unless "grounds therefor, ... if then available, were raised in pre-trial proceedings, or by motion, objection, point for charge, request for findings of fact or conclusions of law, offer of proof, or other appropriate method at trial”). And so, appellee’s argument on post-trial motions was untimely if it appears that appellee could, and should, have objected at trial that appellants' challenge to Dr. Blum's qualifications under the MCARE Act, raised at the nonsuit stage, was untimely. But I would hold that appellee was not obliged to raise this claim earlier. I believe that the belated timing of appellants' objection must be considered in assessing ap-pellee’s issue preservation obligations at the nonsuit stage. Obviously, the appropriate response to appellants' motion for nonsuit would have been an immediate, contemporaneous argument before the trial court that appellants lost their chance to object to Dr. Blum’s qualifications when they failed to object during <em>voir dire </em>or during Dr. Blum’s testimony (if not earlier during motions <em>in </em>limine). But, I would not require such foresight by a party under circumstances like those present here. As noted, appellants obviously could and should have raised the expert qualification-based challenge that, once accepted by the trial court, eviscerated appel-lee’s entire case, during <em>voir dire </em>of appellee's expert — but they did not, which suggests that the timing here was not just belated, but strategic. The modern view of law does not favor trial by surprise or ambush; and finding a waiver here by appellee would invite, if not reward, such tactics. At a minimum, a party that would seek to prevail based upon such a tactic should make certain that its own position has been properly preserved; and appellants have not done that here. In my judgment, in these circumstances, appellee’s post-trial motion may properly be viewed as the first appropriate opportunity after he was actually aggrieved where he was obliged to preserve his argument about appellants' late MCARE Act-based objection and resulting waiver.</p>

These precepts were intended to convey that the focus of subsection (e) is centered upon the relatedness of the fields of medicine as such, rather than the specific care at issue. In the next paragraph, however, the majority articulates a further holding that appears to be in some tension with <em>Gbur. </em>The majority indicates that the “relatedness” inquiry implicates “the specific care at issue” only. This seems difficult to reconcile with the pronouncements of the prior paragraph to the effect that the fields of medicine must be so closely intertwined that by their very nature they will tend to have substantially similar standards of care. In this regard, I note that the “substantially similar standard of care <em>for the specific care at issue </em>” rubric is used only in subsection (c), <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 1303.512(c)(1), (2) (emphasis added), and not in subsection (e), where the focus instead rests on the relatedness of the fields of medicine as such. Thus, while I generally support the majority’s interpretive efforts, I respectfully decline to join its analysis to the degree it can be understood to construe the exception provided by subsection (e) as permitting testimony by a medical expert whose field of specialty is not closely related to that of the defendant physician pursuant to the principles expressed — and presently adopted— in <em>Gbur.</em>

The facts in the present case are arguably even more compelling than in <em>Gbur. </em>After Appellee offered Dr. Blum as an expert witness and examined him on <em>voir dire </em>concerning his qualifications, Appellants cross-examined him on <em>voir dire </em>regarding his background and qualifications, particularly as they related to the professional activities of Drs. Spiegel and Anne. The defendants both concluded their cross-examination by informing the court, "That's all I have at this time.” <em>See </em>N.T. May 1, 2006 at 73, 75; RR. 396a, 398a. In short, they declined to interpose any objection to the admission of Dr. Blum's testimony, although they were well aware of the purpose of that testimony and of the restrictions set forth in the MCARE Act. Additionally, Dr. Anne had moved <em>in limine </em>before trial to preclude Dr. Blum’s testimony only to the extent it would rest upon medical literature published after the time of treatment. <em>See </em>RR. 202a. In her motion she made no mention of the MCARE Act. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.
