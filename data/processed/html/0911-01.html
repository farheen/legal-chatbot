Carolyn Wilson and Murrell, Inc., acted as real estate agents for the transaction. After the sale was completed and the Deans had moved into the house, they filed this suit alleging breach of contract and fraud, and seeking both damages and rescission of the contract of sale. The complaint alleged that the house had a wet basement and that Ms. Garland and the agents had made fraudulent representations to the Deans regarding the condition of the basement. Ms. Garland filed a motion to dismiss the rescission count, which the court granted after a hearing a few months before trial. A jury later returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Garland and the agents, and the court entered judgment accordingly. From that judgment the Deans bring this appeal, raising several claims of error. We affirm.</p>

The contract included an “inspection addendum” signed on the same date. According to paragraph 82 of the addendum, Ms. Garland agreed to make corrections within ten days after receipt of a pre-purchase inspection report. On March 19, 1993, prior to settlement, Lanny Weintraub from Structural Concepts, Inc., performed an inspection of the premises at the Deans’ request. Mr. Weintraub testified at trial that his inspection disclosed “moisture penetration through the exterior walls ... into the basement.” His written inspection report noted, in the “Basement Dampness” category, “water penetration on side wall, also in rear corner.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A copy of the report was faxed by the Deans to Carolyn Wilson and Murrell, Inc., on March 19. Three and a half years later, in September 1996, Mr. Weintraub performed a second inspection “focusing on moisture problems in the basement.” On that occasion he found “extensive water penetration on the side rear wall of the house.” With the aid of specialized equipment, he determined that this was “current moisture penetration. It wasn’t just old moisture penetration.”</p>

Mr. Dean asked Ms. Wilson if she had heard from Ms. Garland “in reference to the inspection report,” adverting specifically to para- . graph 32 of the addendum to the contract and to his understanding that Ms. Garland “had to respond within ten days whether she was going to do the work or not.” Ms. Wilson, however, told the Deans that Ms. Garland did not have to respond in writing “as long as she is going to do the work. The work will be done by settlement.” At one point in the conversation, Mr. Dean said that if Ms. Garland was not going to <a id="p914" href="#p914" data-label="914" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*914</a>make the necessary repairs, he was going to void the contract.</p>

Ms. Wilson replied that she was “pretty sure” they had been. A short time later Ms. Garland arrived. With the inspection report in his hand, Mr. Dean asked Ms. Garland if the repairs had been completed, to which Ms. Garland responded that they had. Following a private conversation with Ms. Garland, however, Ms. Wilson told the Deans that three of the repairs listed on the report had not been completed, “so what we are going to do is pay you for these items here.” Ms. Garland and the agents each agreed to pay the Deans $500 to make the repairs. The agreed sums were paid, though the work was never performed. Mr. Dean testified that he believed that the dampness problem in the basement had been corrected and that it was not one of the items acknowledged as incomplete by Ms. Wilson.</p>
    <p id="b956-5" data-blocks='[["BL_956.5",956,[187,1779,756,447]]]'>Approximately seven months later, after having moved into the house, Mr. Dean discovered that the basement “had flooded, with water coming out of the wall.” Mr. Dean hired Daniel Marcus from Mid-Atlantic Waterproofing to inspect the basement and recommend a course of action. Mr. Marcus estimated that the cost of repairs would be approximately $15,000.</p>

He stated that before the sale was completed, he inspected the downspout on the back of the house and that Ms. Garland had asked him to fix a problem with the drainage system. She described the problem to him as “dampness, and when it rained, dampness would develop. She was getting a little trickle across the floor.” Mr. Turner said that before he made any repairs, the rain water “was building up and washing back into the house and running down the steps ... and up against the back and side walls of the building.” To remedy the problem, he installed a four-inch drain, “and I tapped both the downspout at the rear and the front of the house and opened a hole in the [front] wall ... and poured the water out on the sidewalk.” Shortly before trial Mr. Turner returned to the property and noticed that “the downspout looked like it had been damaged and it was not hooked up.”</p>

Mr. Casario, who had been present in the courtroom during Mr. Marcus’ testimony, said that although it was raining on the day of his inspection, he did not notice any water damage, nor did he smell mildew in the basement. He did, however, notice “some dampness that [he] was actually able to see,” but “the only water penetration [he] saw was in the cove area approximately a foot to eighteen inches wide, perhaps a quarter to a half inch on the floor. Certainly there was no buildup of water, no standing water_” Mr. Casario further testified that “there is only one place that water could come from, which is directly under the slab, and through hydrostatic pressure it is actually forced up through the expansion joint, which is the cove area.” On the basis of his observations, Mr. Casario estimated that the repairs would cost $3,650.</p>

Both counts were based on the alleged failure of appellees to perform certain repairs required by the contract of sale. Several months later the Deans filed an amended complaint, containing the same claims as the original but also seeking rescission of the sale of property, and adding Wachovia Mortgage Company as a defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b957-5" data-blocks='[["BL_957.4",957,[158,797,752,841]]]'>Ms. Garland then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was later joined by the other appellees. In her motion Ms. Garland argued that Wachovia was a necessary party to the rescission count, and that since it had not been properly served, that count should be dismissed. In addition, she maintained that damages for breach of contract and rescission of the contract were mutually exclusive and that the Deans must therefore make an election of remedies. At the hearing on the motion, counsel for the Deans argued that they did not have to elect a remedy until after the verdict, relying principally on <em>Giordano v. Interdonato, </em><a href="/a2d/586/0714-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="586 A.2d 714" data-case-ids="7372308" data-case-paths="/a2d/586/0714-01">586 A.2d 714</a> (D.C.1991).

Rescission is an equitable remedy, and a party seeking rescission must restore the other party to that party’s position at the time the contract was made. <em>See Kent Homes, </em><a href="/a2d/128/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="128 A.2d 444" data-case-ids="8131806" data-case-paths="/a2d/128/0444-01">128 A.2d at 446</a>.

    <p id="b958-4" data-blocks='[["BL_958.4",958,[198,741,758,1097]]]'>The Deans’ reliance on <em>Giordano </em>is misplaced. In that case we held that the trial court had erred by requiring the plaintiff to elect between a claim alleging breach of a fiduciary duty and a claim alleging breach of a subsequent agreement designed to settle the claim of fiduciary breach. Unlike the Deans in the case at bar, however, the plaintiff in <em>Giordano </em>did not assert at trial that she was entitled both to damages for the alleged breach and to specific performance of the settlement agreement. Moreover, while concluding that the trial judge had erred, we also held that “the judge was correct in concluding that the remedies plaintiff sought were duplicative and that, in the event of a judgment favorable to her, she could not win relief on both claims.” <em>Giordano, </em><a href="/a2d/586/0714-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="586 A.2d 714" data-case-ids="7372308" data-case-paths="/a2d/586/0714-01">586 A.2d at 717</a>.

In addition, counsel for the agents put Mrs. Dean on the stand and questioned her about a statement she had made on a credit information form, submitted in connection with the Deans’ application for a mortgage loan to buy the house from Ms. Garland, which indicated that she and her husband had $18,000 more in a bank account than they actually had.</p>

When the prior bad conduct does not rise to the level of a criminal conviction, two requirements must be met before such questions are permissible: “(1) the examiner [must have] a factual predicate for [the] question, and (2) the bad act ‘[must bear] directly upon the veracity of the witness in respect to the issues involved in the trial.’” <em>United States v.

The factual predicate was found in Mr. Dean’s false affidavit and Mrs. Dean’s questionable statement on the credit form. The fact that the Deans would be willing to give false information in an affidavit and alter a financial statement in order to secure a loan bore directly on their credibility as witnesses. In these circumstances we find no error in the trial court’s decision to allow them to be questioned about these matters.</p>

At trial, however, they objected to the report only on the ground that it was not relevant, not on hearsay grounds. It is settled law in this jurisdiction that “once hearsay evidence is admitted without objection, it may be properly considered by the trier of fact and given its full probative value.” <em>Eldridge v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/492/0879-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="492 A.2d 879" data-case-ids="7922142" data-case-paths="/a2d/492/0879-01">492 A.2d 879</a>, 883 (D.C.1985) (citations omitted). In order to reverse, we would have to find plain error in the admission of the report, which the Deans have not shown. Indeed, had a hearsay objection been timely made below at the pre-trial hearing, the author of the report could have been subpoenaed and made available to testify at <a id="p918" href="#p918" data-label="918" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*918</a>trial.

Another inspection report, prepared as part of an appraisal for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), contained no mention of moisture problems in the basement. At a pre-trial hearing held on October 1, 1996, appellants' counsel objected to the admission of this report on the ground of relevancy. After hearing argument from opposing counsel, the trial court ruled that the inspection report was relevant and therefore admissible. When the court asked appellants’ counsel whether there was "something in particular” in the report that counsel found objectionable and offered to hear him on the matter, counsel made no specific complaint, saying only, "I’ll let my objection stand.” The report was admitted into evidence at trial as a defense exhibit.</p>
