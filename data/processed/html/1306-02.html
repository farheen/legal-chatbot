In light of the fact that defendant Edward J. McKee, Sr. has died, the judgment of conviction as to McKee is vacated and, upon remand, the Superior Court is directed to dismiss the charges against him. Since defendant Walshâ€™s whereabouts are unknown and she has apparently left the jurisdiction, the Walsh appeal is also hereby dismissed.</p>
