The court further noted that a 1997 statement of policy of the Department of Revenue, which is still in effect, provides that the sale at retail or use of canned software is subject to sales and use tax. <em><a href="/a2d/922/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="922 A.2d 87" data-case-ids="8306482" data-case-paths="/a2d/922/0087-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing 61 Pa.Code § 60.19).

In denying Dechert’s exceptions, the Commonwealth Court, <em>en banc, </em>reiterated its prior conclusion that, under the plain language of Section 7201(k)(1), a license to use tangible personal property is subject to taxation. The court further opined: “Deehert continues to confuse the corporeal software program with the intangible right to use and copy the software. The object of the transaction is the computer program, not the license. Absent the program, the license is useless.” <em>Dechert LLP v.

    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.9",624,[1005,812,756,1897]]]'>On appeal, Dechert argues that, because Section 7202(a) of the Code imposes sales tax on the sale at retail of <em>tangible personal property, </em>and the definition of tangible personal property does not expressly include software licenses of any type, the amount Dechert paid for licenses to use software is not taxable. In support of its argument, Dechert offers that software programs generally are copyrighted, and that the typical licensing agreement contemplates that the software developer retains ownership of each individual copy of the software program, including single copies delivered to the user. Appellant’s Brief at 13. Thus, Dechert asserts a licensee like itself “acquires the right to use patented processes embodied in the software that it otherwise would be prohibited from using,” and the tangible media by which the software is conveyed, e.g., a compact disk, is of no value in and of itself, and gives the purchaser no right to copy, install, or use the “copyrighted materials and patented ideas that comprise the software program.” <em>Id. </em>at 14. Indeed, Dec-hert points out that tangible media often is unnecessary, since software programs can be downloaded electronically. <em>Id. </em>According to Deehert, “consideration paid for a license to use canned computer software is consideration paid for intangible intellectual property rights, that is, the right to use those instructions, not consideration paid for the transfer of tangible personal property.” <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>

      <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>The Commonwealth, in contrast, contends the Code clearly specifies that licenses to use tangible personal property are taxable, and that Dechert essentially ignores this fact.

    <p id="b625-6" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[85,1015,762,1703]]]'>The issue presented in the instant case is whether canned computer software constitutes tangible personal property under the definition set forth in Section 7201(m) of the Code, and, therefore, is subject to sales tax under Section 7202(a), which imposes sales tax on transfers of tangible personal property. This is an issue of statutory construction, which is a pure question of law; accordingly, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. <em>Commonwealth v. Bortz, </em><a href="/pa/589/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="589 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="2573328" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0431-01">589 Pa. 431</a>, 434, <a href="/pa/589/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="909 A.2d 1221" data-case-ids="2573328,8461601" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0431-01,/a2d/909/1221-01">909 A.2d 1221</a>, 1223 (2006). In accordance with the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1501 <em>et seq., </em>our goal in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a). Generally, the best indication of the General Assembly’s intent is the plain language of the statute. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, Dep’t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em><a href="/pa/588/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="588 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="3788041" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0429-01">588 Pa. 429</a>, 438, <a href="/pa/588/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="905 A.2d 438" data-case-ids="3788041,8467371" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0429-01,/a2d/905/0438-01">905 A.2d 438</a>, 443 (2006). When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the statute is not to be. disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b). When, however, the words of a statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering a number of specific factors, as discussed more fully below. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c).</p>
    <p id="b625-7" data-blocks='[["BL_625.6",625,[889,309,757,1520]]]'>With these principles in mind, to determine whether licenses to use canned computer software constitute tangible personal property under Section 7201(m) of the Code and, thus, are subject to sales tax, we first look to the relevant statute. As noted above, Section 7202(a) provides for the imposition “upon each separate sale at retail of tangible personal property or services, as defined herein, within this Commonwealth a tax of six per cent of the purchase price.” 72 P.S. § 7202(a). “Sale at retail” is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as “[a]ny transfer, for a consideration, of the ownership, custody or possession of tangible personal property, <em>including the grant of any license to use or consume </em>whether such transfer be absolute or conditional and by whatsoever means the same shall have been effected.” 72 P.S. § 7201(k)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, the clear and unambiguous language of the statute provides that a license to use or consume tangible personal property is subject to sales tax. As it is undisputed Dechert purchased licenses to use canned software, the question, therefore, becomes whether canned computer software constitutes tangible personal property.</p>

Similarly, “corporeal property” is defined as “[p]roperty that can be perceived, as opposed to incorporeal property.” <em>Id. </em>at 1253. Although Section 7201(m) provides several examples of corporeal personal property, canned computer software is not contained in the list of examples. Dechert contends that the legislature’s failure to specifically include canned computer software in the definition of tangible personal property, despite including other quasi-physical items such as electricity and cable service, suggests that the legislature did not intend for canned computer software to be taxed. Appellant’s Brief at 24-25. At the very least, Dechert argues that the statute is ambiguous and should be construed in its favor. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b)(3) (a statute imposing a tax must be strictly construed); <em>Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Indeed, this Court previously rejected a similar argument. In <em>Pa. Human Relations Comm’n v.

In rejecting the cemetery’s argument, this Court held that the language of the statute, which defined “place of public accommodation” as “any place which is open to, accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public, including but not limited to [approximately 50 enumerated places of accommodation] but shall not include any accommodations which are in their nature distinctly private,” was “broad and all inclusive.” <a href="/pa/453/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="453 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="577600" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0124-01">453 Pa. at 130-31</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=306%20A.2d%20881" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="306 A.2d 881">306 A.2d at 886</a>.

The Commonwealth Court concluded that the language “including, but not limited to” was “a clear indication that the Legislature intended to exclude nothing, implicitly or otherwise, by the language which follows those words.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=395%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="395 A.2d 299">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=395%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="395 A.2d 299">at 302</a>.

In portions of its brief, Dechert argues that the legislature’s failure to include software <em>licenses </em>in its definition of tangible personal property indicates that licenses to use canned computer software are not intended to be taxed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appellant's Brief at 20-21, 25. As noted by the Commonwealth Court, however, the determinative issue is whether the <em>object </em>of the license — canned computer software—is tangible personal property, as Section 7201(k)(l) is clear that a license to use tangible personal property is subject to tax. <em>See </em>72 P.S. §§ 7201(k)(1), 7202(a). Thus, to the extent Dechert relies on or references the legislature’s failure to include <em>licenses </em>to use canned computer software in the definition of tangible personal property, we reject Dechert’s arguments, and confine our analysis to whether canned computer software constitutes tangible personal property.</p>

Dechert alleges that the <em>Graham Packaging </em>decision was erroneous for several reasons, and, therefore, should be rejected. First, Dechert argues that the court improperly relied on Louisiana law, specifically, <em>South Central Bell, supra, </em>to determine that canned software license renewals were tangible personal property. Dechert additionally contends that the decision in <em>Graham Packaging </em>is illogical because, while it explicitly "recognizes that custom software is not subject to tax,” it nevertheless adopts a test — the essence of the transaction test — under which custom software <em>would </em>be taxable as tangible personal property, in that "custom software is identical to canned software in all material respects,” and the "only material difference is that custom software is designed for one user, whereas canned software is more readily available.” Appellant’s Brief at 22. As we find it unnecessary to rely on the essence of the transaction test adopted by the court in <em>Graham Packaging </em>to determine whether canned computer software constitutes tangible personal property, Dechert's challenges to <em>Graham Packaging </em>do not warrant further discussion.</p>

It is a set of instructions to the computer in the form of binary pulses configured in the computer’s memory; as such, they do not “take up space” as <em>Graham Packaging </em>suggests, but instead simply reorder the configuration of electrons <em>already on the computer. </em>The informational reorganization dictates specific functions for the computer to perform. <em>See First National Bank of Springfield, </em><a href="/citations/?q=51%20Ill.%20Dec.%20667" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="51 Ill.

If one thinks of “adding” a program to a computer, one thinks of putting some additional physical thing on it, even if it is microscopic electronic code. However, this too often is our mistake. Licensed preprogrammed software does not add a thing to a computer— the software merely rearranges what is already there. It does not, as many jurists have incorrectly stated, “take up space on the hard drive.” Those electrons the software reorganized do exist there, but they <em>already </em>existed — they have just been reconfigured without addition. The way the computer operates has been changed, but it has not been given any additional electrons — its existing dormant electrons have been given a new purpose.</p>
    <p id="b634-7" data-blocks='[["BL_634.7",634,[1008,698,752,867]]]'>It is much like golf. New clubs are tangible — they may or may not change one’s ability to put the ball in the hole, but they are tangible additions. However, a golf <em>lesson </em>is not. The things that enable the swing have always been there, and the lesson (hopefully) improves the swing — the preexisting muscles simply initiate a modified series of actions consistent with the golf pro’s instruction. Nothing tangible has been added to the golfer. Computers, which follow instructions better than the average golfer, accept the new directions from the software without exception, but that does not transform the instructions themselves into tangible personal property.</p>
    <p id="b634-8" data-blocks='[["BL_634.8",634,[1005,1608,753,498]]]'>Like the aftermath of having one’s company listen to a motivational speaker, the results may be tangible, but the lessons themselves are not. Accordingly, I would conclude a license to reconfigure one’s existing computer electrons via canned software does not involve tangible property, and is thus not subject to sales tax pursuant to 72 P.S. § 7202(a); accordingly, I would reverse the Commonwealth Court.</p>
