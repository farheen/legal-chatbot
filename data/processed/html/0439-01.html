The Bankruptcy Court did not leave Technical Land without an equitable remedy.

Technical Land has also attempted to establish insurable interest based on the Use Agreement. That contention fails, however, because the Use Agreement was between TVII and the Trustee in Bankruptcy. Technical Land was not a party to it. Moreover, TVII cannot recover on the instant insurance policy because it was not a party to the policy.</blockquote>

Technical Land does not contest the validity of the Bankruptcy Court's order voiding the Marshal’s Deed, but instead contends in its brief on appeal that “the validity of legal title is not determinative of its insurable interest in the property.” Appellant also does not argue that because the Marshal's Deed was valid at the time the insurance was procured and at the time of the first loss, and Technical Land reasonably believed at those times that it owned the property, Technical Land had an insurable interest in the property. It remains an open question, therefore, whether the after-the-fact invalidity of an otherwise sufficient deed necessarily destroys an insurable interest absent any other evidence of an economic stake in the property at issue. <em>See Nelson v.

Technical Land attempts to discount <em>Ed-mister </em>by claiming that the Eighth Circuit misapplied Missouri law in holding that tenant status is insufficient to confer an insurable interest.

We do not understand it to be asserting a claim for lost profits or damaged equipment, however, but for damage to the properly, based on its economic, business-related interest in the building. The scope of coverage under the contract of insurance has not been briefed before this court and is not before us. See <em>supra </em>note 10.
