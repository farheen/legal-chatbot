A fire company headed by Assistant Fire Chief Gerald Bessette (Bessette) was dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, Bessette observed smoke billowing from the roof area of building A of the complex. East Providence Fire Captain Joseph Castro (Castro), also on the scene, noticed a distinct “glowing” in one of building A’s cellar windows. Bessette and Castro agreed that they faced a “cellar fire.” Because Bessette believed that the fire was in a storage area behind the glowing window, that location became the focus of the firefighting efforts.</p>

Castro left, then reentered the cellar from another position to confront the fire in the laundry room, which adjoined the storage room. The firefighting activity was delayed as firefighters searched for two occupants who were unaccounted for. Firefighter Stephen Afflerbach (Afflerbach) eventually rescued a woman from a third-floor window of building A.</p>

Leddy, who was qualified by the trial court as an expert on the cause and origin of fires, traced the “fire pattern” from the third story of building A to the storage room in the cellar and, ultimately, to a storage bin. He concluded that the fire had been set intentionally. McKenna, also qualified to render an expert opinion, independently concluded that the fire had been intentionally set and had originated in the storage room.</p>

      <em>In </em>support of his contention that his confession was involuntary, defendant primarily relied upon several specific occurrences during the interrogation. He argued that by informing him of the polygraph results, Leddy impermissibly coaxed him into confessing. This court has never expressly addressed the voluntariness of confessions made before, during, or after polygraph examinations. Other courts, however, have considered this issue and have concluded that polygraph examinations are not inherently coercive. <em>See, e.g., People v.

The trial justice stated to the jury, “If you conclude that the statement given in this case was against the will of the defendant, that he did not give it <em>after weighing whatever was said to him </em>and deciding [that] he would make the choice, then you disregard the confession.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
