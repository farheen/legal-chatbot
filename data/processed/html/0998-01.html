The Commonwealth may sustain its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt by means of wholly circumstantial evidence.

This is of no consequence, however, because we find that the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate that Appellant possessed the necessary <em>mens rea.</em>

    <p id="b1049-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1049.7",1049,[97,1159,756,1132]]]'>¶ 11 Prior to analyzing the Commonwealth’s circumstantial evidence for a determination of whether it proves the offense, we believe it is helpful to delve into the history of the offense of reckless driving and to delve deeper into the <em>mens rea </em>element implicated thereby. Previously, “reckless driving” was found at 75 Pa.C.S. § 1001, and defined as follows: “Reckless driving is unlawful, and for the purpose of this act, is construed to include the following: (1) Any person who drives any vehicle or streetcar or trackless trolley omnibus upon a highway carelessly disregarding the rights or safety of others, or in a manner so as to endanger any person or property. (2) If investigation into an accident arising from the use and operation of a motor vehicle discloses that the accident occurred due to the front seat of the motor vehicle having been occupied by more than three (3) persons.”</p>

Notably the offense, although still titled “reckless driving,” now requires the actor . to drive in “willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.” However, the offense previously known as reckless driving has not truly disappeared. It has been renamed careless driving and is found at 75 Pa.C.S. § 3714. The offense reads:</p>

    <p id="AuO" data-blocks='[["BL_1049.12",1049,[896,738,755,607]]]'>However, from another perspective, the offense of reckless driving has simply come full circle, as the offense was amended in 1951 to remove “Willful or wanton conduct in the operation of a vehicle as an essential element of the offense.” <em>Commonwealth v. Forrey, </em><a href="/pa-super/172/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="172 Pa. Super. 65" data-case-ids="477206" data-case-paths="/pa-super/172/0065-01">172 Pa.Super. 65</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.2d%20233" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="92 A.2d 233">92 A.2d 233</a>, 234 (1952).

    <p id="b1049-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1049.13",1049,[897,1366,753,500]]]'>¶ 13 The mere fact that there currently exists two offenses covering culpably dangerous driving behavior supports the conclusion that one is a “greater” offense, and the other a “lesser” offense. Of course, the mere titling of the offenses suggests that the lesser offense is careless driving and the greater reckless driving. A review of the elements supports this conclusion.</p>

Wood, </em><a href="/pa-super/327/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="327 Pa.

Conscious disregard, and by incorporation, “willful or wanton disregard” was characterized in <em>Wood </em>using language tak<a id="p1002" href="#p1002" data-label="1002" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1002</a>°en directly from the definitions of criminal culpability in the Crimes Code: “The <em>mens rea </em>required for recklessly endangering is recklessness — described in 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 302(b)(3) as ‘conscious disregard’ of a substantial and unjustifiable risk, whereas the <em>mens rea </em>for [careless driving] is “careless disregard.” <em>Id. </em>at 836 (emphasis supplied). Thus, it follows that “willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property” is synonymous with recklessness as it is defined in the Crimes Code, and as the title “reckless driving” implies. Moreover, it follows that satisfying this element requires a greater degree of criminal culpability than mere carelessness. <em>Forrey </em>also indicates as much. We stated there while referencing the elimination of the willful and wanton element:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1050-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1050.5",1050,[235,1253,717,761]]]'>.. .in so doing it is clear that the legislature did not intend to increase a driver’s responsibility for ordinary negligence by reclassifying mere negligence as reckless driving. What was contemplated in the language ‘carelessly disregarding the rights or safety of others, or in a manner so as to endanger any person or property’ was to set the minimal requisite of the statutory offense of reckless driving at less than wilful and wanton conduct on the one hand and, on the other, something more than ordinary negligence or the mere absence of care under the circumstances.</blockquote>

The Commonwealth may prove recklessness by circumstantial evidence; however, “the pieces of evidence must fit together so tightly as to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>See Commonwealth v.

The entirely circumstantial case presented by the Commonwealth is essentially limited to skid marks that appeared to lead to a damaged vehicle and the assumption that Appellant was drinking before the accident. As Appellant correctly notes, the Commonwealth presented no expert witness such as an accident reconstructionist, who may have offered important insight as to the nature of the accident. Most importantly, there were no eyewitnesses to corroborate the Commonwealth’s theory.</p>

In so arguing, the Commonwealth seemingly attempts to imply that driving while under the influence constitutes a status of legal recklessness or is recklessness <em>per se. </em>However, this argument is contrary to caselaw.

However, since recklessness further requires a “conscious disregard” of the danger, to prove reckless driving it would also be theoretically necessary to prove that the driver appreciated this factor and drove anyway. In this case, we cannot conclude that the Commonwealth has established Appellant was intoxicated to such a level.</p>
    <p id="b1052-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1052.11",1052,[1001,573,755,1591]]]'>¶ 23 Perhaps more problematic is the fact that the court granted Appellant’s demurrer to the driving under the influence charge. The effect of this ruling was that the Commonwealth’s evidence failed to establish that Appellant was under the influence to a degree that rendered him incapable of safe driving. If the evidence was found lacking to prove that Appellant was incapable of safe driving, we fail to see how signs of intoxication in a vacuum support a charge of reckless driving. A review of the argument on the demurrer indicates that it was granted because the Commonwealth failed to establish when Appellant’s intoxication occurred. Although the arresting officer testified that he arrived on the scene shortly after receiving the call, there was no testimony indicating when the accident actually occurred. Moreover, although the officer testified that the keys were in the ignition he could not recall whether the engine was running and he failed to check to see if the engine was still warm. Thus, although Appellant exhibited classic signs of being intoxicated when the police encountered him, the Commonwealth failed to rule out the possibility that Appellant’s state of intoxication came after the accident had occurred.</p>

However, it offered no competent expert testimony establishing what such a skid mark implies in terms of a vehicle’s speed. The Commonwealth further failed to produce testimony of the applicable speed limit on the <a id="p1005" href="#p1005" data-label="1005" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1005</a>stretch of road in question. Nevertheless, proof that Appellant was exceeding the speed limit does not necessarily prove reckless driving either. As with drivers who drive while intoxicated, life experience teaches without possibility of refutation that many drivers drive at high rates of speed on a regular basis without tragic consequence. While undoubtedly, just as driving while under the influence may increase the risk of an accident occurring, “speeding” may also increase the risk that a driver will be involved in a motor vehicle accident, more “ordinary” or “common” speeding does not necessarily produce a “substantial” risk that an accident will occur. Indeed, as anyone who has ever driven the speed limit down the interstate has easily observed, not only will an overwhelming majority of drivers who drive in excess of the legal speed limit not crash their vehicles, they will also escape citation for exceeding the speed limit.</p>
    <p id="b1053-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1053.5",1053,[111,1469,750,863]]]'>¶ 25 This is not to say that driving fast cannot rise to a level of legal recklessness. Undoubtedly, there is a speed at which when one drives he has increased the degree of risk of an accident occurring to such a level that the willful and wantonness requirement of reckless driving will be satisfied. That is, we can assume that if one approaches speeds seen at the Indianapolis 500 while on ordinary roadways, the risk of a crash is so high as to constitute willful and wanton driving behavior. However, here, there is insufficient evidence to prove that Appellant had driven at such a high rate of speed that he created a “substantial risk” of a motor vehicle accident.</p>

The mere fact that an accident occurred here does not prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Appellant was driving recklessly prior to running off the road. The evidence might sufficiently establish that Appellant drove too fast for the existing road conditions. However, as the discussion regarding the elements of reckless driving above indicates, reckless driving implies grossly unsafe driving behavior. While the circumstances surrounding the accident might hint at highly unsafe driving behavior, in our opinion it does not establish it beyond reasonable doubt. Appellant could have placed himself in a position of having to slam on the brakes due to momentarily falling asleep, or experiencing some sort of seizure. He may have diverted his attention momentarily from the road at the precise moment his attention was most required to negotiate a turn in the roadway. In reality, no one, other than Appellant, knows precisely how the accident occurred. However, to the extent the accident might have occurred because he was driving in a “reckless manner,” Appellant did not so incriminate himself and is not compelled to do so under the law.</p>
