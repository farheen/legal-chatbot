In his dissent, Justice Cappy states his belief that, absent a finding of dependency, the trial court lacks the authority to transfer custody of the child to the father in this case. We disagree. Judges in custody matters have broad powers to fashion remedies to meet the best interests of the children involved. For example, a custody judge may modify any existing custody order to a shared custody order <em>sua sponte </em>(23 Pa.C.S. § 5304) or may decline to enter a custody order as agreed to by the parents (23 Pa.C.S. § 5307). As a general rule, a judge making a custody determination must consider a number of factors, including any abusive conduct by any adult member of the child's household. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5303. A dependency hearing is a form of custody proceeding. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5343. Thus, a judge in a dependency proceeding has authority to modify the existing custody arrangement whether or not the judge makes a finding of dependency. Indeed, recently in <em>Charles v. Stehlik, </em><a href="/pa/560/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="560 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="95752" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0334-01">560 Pa. 334</a>, 340, <a href="/a2d/744/1255-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="744 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="11495457,95752" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/1255-01,/pa/560/0334-01">744 A.2d 1255</a>, 1258 (2000), we stated: "It is axiomatic that in custody disputes, 'the fundamental issue is the best interest of the child.’ ” In order for courts in custody disputes to accommodate the best interests of the child, the judge must have broad discretion to act in terms of modifying custody. Custody orders, unlike orders in other civil matters, are inherently mutable when the circumstances dictate a change or modification. Therefore, granting custody judges broad discretion to act <a id="p852" href="#p852" data-label="852" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*852</a>when the court deems it appropriate is necessary to meet the best interests of children.</p>

It seems to me that if, at the informal hearing, a non-custodial parent were “ready, willing and able” to assume care of the child and the noncustodial parent was not implicated in the abuse, a dependency hearing would not be “appropriate.” Moreover, if a non-custodial parent did not come forward at the informal hearing to assume custody or the non-custodial parent’s involvement in the abuse was unclear, then no “ready, willing and able” parent exists and the child would be therefore “dependent.”</p>

If either parent refuses these social services, then the county agency may initiate “the appropriate court proceeding” pursuant to Section 6370(b). Thus, in some circumstances, even though a child has both a custodial and non-custodial parent willing to assume care for the child, neither parent is willing to accept social services in order to exercise proper parental care and control, and thereby prevent the abuse and, again, the child would be declared “dependent.” It could also be that after social services are offered, they do not achieve their goal and protective services are required to avoid continued abuse and neglect.

However, the majority has improperly combined these definitions into a single statement which presupposes the result the majority seeks to reach. I cannot agree with this analysis, as I do not believe that the legislature would expend the effort to set forth nine different definitions, only to have them be commingled by the courts. In my view, when the custodial parent who is primarily responsible for the child’s safety and well-being fails to provide proper parental care or control, the child may be deemed to be a “dependent child” pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302(1), regardless of whether the child’s non-custodial parent is ready, willing and able to care for the child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

In footnote 3 of the majority opinion, the majority attempts to cure the defect by relying on the definition of "custody proceeding” in the provisions relating to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 5341 <em>et seq. </em>Reliance on this definition is misplaced for two reasons. First, these provisions address interstate, intrastate and international jurisdictional conflicts, none of which are implicated in this case. Second, the definition is not a legislative grant that confers jurisdiction over the child in an action brought under the Juvenile Act.</p>

This interpretation is further supported by 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(b), which requires certain pre-placement findings prior to the removal of a dependent child "from his home”. This language indicates that proper parental care or control must be lacking in the child’s home, regardless of whether one or both parents reside there.</p>

For example, consider the case in which a mother, who takes medication for her bipolar condition, has primary physical custody of her six-year-old son. Assume that the father has had almost no involvement with his son, although he seems to be a suitable caretaker as he is raising two other children with his current wife. On two occasions, the mother stopped taking her medication, which resulted in the child being placed in dangerous situations. The child’s school alerted CYS, which initiated an investigation and then filed a dependency petition, arguing that the child should be deemed to be dependent because of the possibility that the mother may again cease taking her medication. If the Juvenile Court judge believes that the mother may stop taking her medication, then the Ju-" venile Act intends that the judge be allowed to enter a finding of dependency and order that given the father’s absence in the child's life, it is in the best interests of the child that he stays with his mother with supervision and monitoring.</p>

Life is replete with examples of non-custodial parents, who may be fine citizens in all other respects, but who have not had any contact, or at least have had only minimal contact, with their child over the course of that child's life. The fact that this "complete stranger” is a biological parent is certainly a factor to be taken into consideration by the court when making a decision in a dependency proceeding. Yet, the biological connection alone cannot suffice as an unassailable determining factor; it is only one factor in determining the best disposition for the child in the situation presented.</p>

Additionally, the majority’s decision invites several procedural difficulties. Presumably, to ensure that a finding of dependency is made when a child is endangered, CYS must now include in the petition specific allegations that will support a finding that the noncustodial parent is not ready, willing and able to provide the child with proper parental care and control. This will necessitate additional investigation into the availability and fitness <a id="p858" href="#p858" data-label="858" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*858</a>of the non-custodial parent, which may cause undue delay when the child is endangered. Then, there is the unresolved question as to what standard should apply: should the court use the "best interests” standard, or need the court merely determine that the non-custodial parent is ready, willing and able to care for the child? If the latter standard applies (as the majority implies), does CYS bear the burden of proving that the non-custodial parent is not ready, willing and able to care for the child, or does the non-custodial parent have to prove those elements to the satisfaction of the court? The majority opinion fails to address these concerns, or provide any guidance to the lower courts.</p>
