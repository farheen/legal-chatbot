    <p id="b231-19" data-blocks='[["BL_231.17",231,[924,646,746,520]]]'>Appellant sued his two former partners for money alleged to he due him. After a lengthy trial without a jury the trial court found that appellant had received from the partnership all the money to which he was entitled except the sum of $18.10, and awarded him judgment for that amount. He has appealed, claiming that he should have been awarded a larger amount. Our examination of the record reveals no error affecting substantial rights.</p>
