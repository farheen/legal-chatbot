In this field, optical fibers, made of flexible, light-transmitting material and having a very small diameter, are used instead of conventional lenses and mirrors to transmit light and images. Many thousands of these fibers are bound together to form what is said to 'be known in the art as a “bundle”. When the individual fibers making up the bundle are arranged at each end of the bundle in the same relationship that they bear to each other at the opposite end of the bundle, the result is called a “fiberscope”, which, when <a id="p1388" href="#p1388" data-label="1388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1388</a>properly made of the right kind of fibers, constitutes an image-transmitting device. Such instruments are extremely useful for looking into what are otherwise practically inaccessible areas, such as the interior of the human stomach or that of an engine or other complicated apparatus. Needless to say, there are many other light and/or image transmitting uses.</p>

After a detailed analysis of the evidence, the board concluded that Norton had satisfactorily proved conception of the invention no earlier than April, 1957. It was further concluded that, while Norton had demonstrated diligence, he had proved no actual reduction to practice prior to his application filing date of July 3,1957. With regard to the party Curtiss, the board found that Curtiss was in possession of a complete and operative conception of the invention of the counts in December of 1956. That holding, coupled with its finding that Norton did not prove conception before April, 1957, or reduction to practice prior to his July 3, 1957, filing date, compelled the decision that Curtiss was the first to conceive and the first to reduce to practice even if he were restricted to his May 6,1957 filing date as a reduction to practice. Apparently for that reason, the <a id="p1389" href="#p1389" data-label="1389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1389</a>board specifically refrained from making a bolding whether Curtiss had <em>actually </em>reduced the invention to practice in December 1956 or at any other specific time before his filing date.</p>

However, before we can reach those issues we must resolve an additional issue. The party Norton has charged that Curtiss committed fraud on the Patent Office during the ex parte prosecution of his application and that, as a result of this fraud, the Curtiss application should be stricken under Patent Office Buie 56 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and “priority” awarded to Norton.</p>

    <p id="b711-7" data-blocks='[["BL_711.7",711,[112,1188,1325,346]]]'>We disagree. If the charges made by Norton are found to be of substance, Curtiss stands to lose, at the least, his right to have those claims in his present application to which the charges relate mature into a patent. That translates, in this case, to a loss of standing as a party to the interference. This question is clearly one which is ancillary to priority and was therefore properly considered by the board and must now be reviewed by this court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Since the asserted fraud was perpetrated during the prosecution of the Curtiss application, some of this discussion will relate to what went on during ex parte proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b712-4" data-blocks='[["BL_712.6",712,[227,551,1323,594]]]'>Initially, we point out that the applications of both parties now before us were copending before the same examiner and were being-examined concurrently. The position originally taken by the examiner, in both applications, was that the claims directed to the invention now before us were unpatentable because they involved the mere substitution of obviously equivalent materials. The file of the Curtiss application shows that, after the first rejection of his claims, Curtiss and his attorney conducted two interviews with the Primary Examiner and his assistant. No verbatim record of what was said at these meetings was made, but in each case, the attorney followed up the interview with an amendment and, in the accompanying remarks, extensively discussed what transpired at the interview.</p>
    <p id="b712-5" data-blocks='[["BL_712.7",712,[230,1151,1319,94]]]'>With regard to the first interview, we accept the board’s summary of the remarks accompanying the ensuing amendment: ■</p>
    <blockquote id="b712-6" data-blocks='[["BL_712.8",712,[229,1278,1322,364]]]'>In the amendatory remarks, Curtiss’ attorney acknowledged tlie interview of July 20, 1960 and stated that “an image transmitting fiber bundle containing glass-coated glass fibers” was there demonstrated, that the examiners “immediately recognized the superior and outstandingly unique properties of this image transmitting device”, and that the examiners suggested “that applicant submit an affidavit in support of the fact that applicant’s glass-coated glass fibers have properties so different from and so superior to plastic-coated fibers that applicant’s glass-coated glass fibers and fiber bundles made therefrom represent an important and patentable advance over the prior art.”</blockquote>

It was stated that “the glass-coated fiber specimens transmitted sufficient light to permit their being satisfactorily used in a light transmitting devise.” On the other hand, it was stated that the plastic-coated fiber specimens “were entirely unsatisfactory for use in a light transmitting device” and were “virtually incapable of transmitting light except for such light rays which happen to pass axially through the fiber essentially without the occurrence of internal reflections.”</p>
    <p id="b713-5" data-blocks='[["BL_713.5",713,[99,881,1322,195]]]'>The examiner responded that this affidavit was not persuasive and made the rejection final. Curtiss requested a second interview.

    <p id="b714-4" data-blocks='[["BL_714.5",714,[207,586,1325,442]]]'>During the interference motion period, Norton moved to dissolve on the ground that the counts were unpatentable.

    <p id="b714-6" data-blocks='[["BL_714.7",714,[209,1333,1323,342]]]'>After all the testimony had been taken on both issues, Norton then filed a petition asking the commissioner to strike the Curtiss application under Buie 56 on the ground that Curtiss had, during the ex parte prosecution of his application, made fraudulent misrepresentations in an attempt to convince the Patent Office of the patentability of the substitution of glass for plastic as the low index outer coating of an optical fiber.</p>

He urged that “these were purposeful misrepresentations by Curtiss of relevant and material facts to ‘prove’ a difference in kind” between his glass-coated fiber and the plastic-coated fibers of the prior art. Specifically, Norton asserted that Curtiss’s statement that “the plastic-coated fibers in relatively short lengths of about 12 inches or less <a id="p1393" href="#p1393" data-label="1393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1393</a>had only marginal usefulness even when used with extremely brilliant light sources and that long lengths of such plastic-coated fibers were entirely useless for transmitting light,” was “an out-and-out untruth and Curtiss knew that it was!” He contended that both he, Norton, and Curtiss were aware that plastic-coated fibers were well known in the art to be reasonably good light conductors. The petition stated that the misconduct alleged would be proved “primarily out of the mouth of the applicant Curtiss.” To this end, Norton submitted the following items of evidence:</p>
    <p id="b715-4" data-blocks='[["BL_715.4",715,[105,658,1322,197]]]'>(1) a bundle of plastic coated fibers (Norton Exhibit 23), approximately one meter in length, made by Curtiss prior to his work with glass cladding.

Peters, a one-third interest in their respective applications, that the Curtiss application contained a cross-reference to and “a brief resume of the Hirschowitz application”, and that “during the prosecution of the Curtiss application one of the figures of the Hirschowitz application was actually incorporated in the Curtiss specification,” Norton urged that</p>

    <p id="b724-4" data-blocks='[["BL_724.4",724,[201,357,1326,795]]]'>We note first that traditionally, the concept of “fraud” has most often been used by the courts, in general, to refer to a type of conduct so reprehensible that it could alone form the basis of an actionable wrong (e.g., the common law action for deceit). That narrow range of conduct, now frequently referred to as “technical” or “affirmative” fraud, is looked upon by the law as quite serious. Because severe penalties are usually meted out to the party found guilty of such conduct, technical fraud is generally held <em>not </em>to exist unless the following indispensable elements are found to be present: (1) a representation of a material fact, (2) the falsity of that representation, (3) the intent to deceive or, at least, a state of mind so reckless as to the consequences that it is held to be the equivalent of intent (scienter), (4) a justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation by the party deceived which induces him to act thereon, and (5) injury to the party deceived as a result of his reliance on the misrepresentation. See, e.g., W. Prosser, <em>Lam of Torts, </em>§§ 100-05 (3d ed. 1964); 37 C.J.S., <em>Fraud, </em>§ 3 (1943).</p>
    <p id="b724-5" data-blocks='[["BL_724.5",724,[195,1158,1327,898]]]'>But the term “fraud” is also commonly used to define that conduct which may be raised as a defense in an action at equity for enforcement of a specific obligation. In this context, it is evident that the concept takes on a whole new scope. Conduct constituting what has been called earlier “technical fraud” will, of course, always be recognized as a defense. However, in these situations, failure, for one reason or another, to satisfy all the elements of the technical offense often will not necessarily result in a holding of “no fraud”. Rather the courts appear to look at the equities of the particular case and determine whether the conduct before them — which might have been admittedly less than fraudulent in the technical sense — was still so reprehensible as to justify the court’s refusing to enforce the rights of the party guilty of such conduct. It might be said that in such instances the concept of fraud becomes intermingled with the equitable doctrine of “unclean hands”. A court might still evaluate the evidence in light of the traditional elements of technical fraud, but will now include a broader range of conduct within each of those elements, giving consideration to the equities involved in the particular case.</p>

Thus, in suits involving patents, today, the concept of “fraud” on the Patent Office (at least where a patentee’s conduct pertaining to the relative merits of his invention is concerned), encompasses not only that whitíh we have earlier termed “technical” fraud, but also a wider range of “inequitable” conduct found to justify holding a patent unenforceable. The courts differ as to the conduct they will recognize as being sufficiently reprehensible so as to carry with it the consequences of technical fraud. Nevertheless, one factor stands clear: the courts have become more critical in their interpretation of the relationship existing between applicants for patent and the Patent Office and their scrutiny of the conduct of applicants in light of that relationship. Not unlike those appearing before other administrative agencies, applicants before the Patent Office are being held to a relationship of confidence and trust to that agency. The indicated expansion of the concept of “fraud” manifests an attempt by the courts to make this relationship meaningful.</p>

The ex parte prosecution and examination of a patent application must not be considered as an adversary proceeding and should not be limited to the standards required in inter partes proceedings. With the seemingly ever-increasing number of applications before it, the Patent Office has a tremendous burden. While being a fact-finding as well as an adjudicatory agency, it is necessarily limited in the time permitted to ascertain the facts necessary to adjudge the patentable merits of each application. In addition, it has no testing facilities of its own. Clearly, it must rely on applicants for many of the facts upon which its decisions are based. The highest standards of honesty and candor on the part of applicants in presenting such facts to the office are thus necessary elements in a working patent system. We would go so far as to say they are essential. It follows, therefore, that we do approve of the indicated expansion of the types of misconduct for which applicants will be penalized.</p>

In technical fraud, to be “material”, the fact misrepresented must be “the efficient, inducing, and proximate cause, or the determining ground” of the action taken in reliance thereon. 31 C.J.S., Fraud, §18 (1943). In patent cases, “materiality” has generally been interpreted to mean that if the Patent Office had been aware of the complete or true facts, the challenged claims would not have been allowed.

Findings of materiality should not be limited only to those situations where there can be no dispute that the true facts, or the complete facts, if they had been known, would most likely have prevented the allowance of the particular claims at issue or alternatively, would provide a basis for holding those claims invalid. In such cases, the claims at issue would probably be invalid, in any event, because of the <em>existence </em>of those facts, m <em>and of themselves. </em>Whether the claims would also be unenforceable because a fraud was committed in misrepresenting the facts to the Patent Office would really be of secondary importance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> It is our view that a proper interpretation of the “materiality” element of fraud in this context must include therein consideration of factors apart from the objective patentability of the claims at issue, particularly (where possible) the subjective considerations of the examiner and the applicant. Indications in the record that the claims at issue <em>would </em>not have been allowed but for the challenged misrepresentations must not be overlooked due to any certainty on the part of the reviewing tribunal that the claimed invention, viewed objectively, <em>should </em>have been patented.

Perhaps it is most of all in the traditional element of “scienter” that the existence of a fiduciary-like duty should have its effect. As we have already indicated, the procurement of a patent involves the public interest, not only in regard to the subject matter of the patent grant, but also in the system under which that grant is obtained. Conduct in this area necessarily must be judged with that interest always taken into account and objective standards applied. Good faith and subjective intent, while they are to be considered, should not <em>necessarily </em>be made controlling. Under ordinary circumstances, the <em>fact </em>of misrepresentation coupled with proof that the party making it had knowledge of its falsity is enough to warrant drawing the inference that there was a fraudulent intent. Where public policy demands a complete and accurate disclosure it may suffice to show nothing more than that the misrepresentations were made in an atmosphere of gross negligence as to their truth. The Commissioner and the board, by apparently giving controlling effect on this point to Curtiss’s subjective belief that his invention was superior narrowed the requirement almost to that of proving actual intent.

We note first that the statements made in the affidavits and in the discussions by Curtiss’s attorney regarding the demonstration before the examiners appear to be accurate <em>at least insofar </em>as they apply to the actual plastic-coated fibers actually described and used by Curtiss. So viewed, there was no literal misrepresentation. However, as we indicated earlier, if <a id="p1407" href="#p1407" data-label="1407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1407</a>the level of performance of the plastic-coated fibers actually employed in the comparison, was <em>below </em>that of the best prior art known to Curtiss, then the statements made to the examiner, regardless of their literal truth, could still amount to misrepresentation by implication. Since the most relevant, meaningful comparison would necessarily have to have been between the claimed glass-coated fibers and the <em>best </em>plastic-coated fibers available to the prior art, Curtiss’s statements must be considered as an implied representation that, as far as he knew, he was making such a comparison. On this point we note that the record is singularly unclear as to the actual state of the prior art with regard to the performance levels of plastic-coated fibers. It is true that the record includes a number of instances which tend to show that, prior to the subject comparison, Curtiss was aware of plastic-coated fibers possessing a better level of performance than the fibers of Exhibit 11, the fibers actually shown to the examiners. There is also mention in the testimony of Norton’s witness Hicks that Norton’s assignee possessed plastic-coated fibers which performed better than the fibers of Exhibit 11. Notwithstanding this, we can find no indication in the record, much less convincing proof, that the particular fibers referred to were in fact <em>prior art </em>fibers, i.e., that they were available to the art generally at the time Curtiss made his claimed invention. We find this deficiency fatal to Norton’s case.</p>

We note, particularly, testimony supporting Curtiss’s recollection that, during the time he was working on his project at the University of Michigan, he and his co-workers had never prepared fibers coated with plastic having a higher index of refraction than the core and the statements in the record indicating that the plastic coating deteriorates with age. Both <a id="p1408" href="#p1408" data-label="1408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1408</a>of these points support the contention that Curtiss bad some basis to believe that the plastic-coated fibers he showed to the examiners were, in fact, the same fibers he had prepared several years earlier. We therefore approve the board’s holding that Curtiss’s negligence in this respect was not enough, by itself, to warrant striking his application. If it had been shown satisfactorily that the performance of plastic-coated fibers available to the art generally at the time Curtiss made his invention was significantly higher than the fibers actually demonstrated, <em>and </em>that Curtiss was aware pi that fact at the time of the demonstration, we would 'be disposed to consider proof of this one negligent act as an element in establishing the existence of a state of mind so grossly irresponsible as to justify a holding of fraudulent misconduct.

The standard has been and still is that proof of fraud must be clear and convincing. Thus, the one asserting misconduct carries a heavy burden of persuasion.

The experiment seemed to be going well with the glass of the tube collapsing on the rod when the experimenters went out to lunch. Upon returning, however, they found that the furnace apparently had overheated and the glass assembly curled around the liner of the furnace and stuck to it. The product was a coarse, coated fiber about a tenth of an inch in diameter roughly in the shape of a helix. Irritated at having spoiled the work, Hicks took down the machinery and threw it into the corner of the room. Three or four weeks later, Hicks chipped out some of the coated glass, a few inches in length, and he and Bazinet redrew it in another furnace into a fiber and made a comparison test with plastic coated fibers. Hicks had “no recollection” of the measurements of it.</p>

The tested fiber was described as “a 'bad fiber, which probably had a bad interface” (the region between the core glass and the cladding) and as having “an excessive loss of light.” In a contemporary memo of Hicks dated April 4, 1957, Hicks stated that the cladding job on the fiber was “poor” and that the fiber was “too brittle”. Bazinet called it “pretty bad” compared to plastic coated fibers tested.</p>

He first bundled 16 <em>wncoated </em>rods together in “a four-by-four array”, the rods not being welded together, and drew them down individually into a series of 16 fibers. The resulting fibers were not in any way attached to each other and “were useless for the purpose.” In a second experiment he welded the rods together very lightly and then drew them down in a series of operations to produce a group of fibers related similarly to the original rods. Norton reported these experiments to MacNeille in a letter dated April 5, 1957. Shortly thereafter Norton took specimens from the experiments to AO where he displayed them to MacNeille, Hicks and O’Brien and conferred with patent counsel apparently on April 10, 1957. A first draft of the Norton patent application was transmitted to Norton by patent counsel on April 28, 1957. That draft is directed almost exclusively to a process in which a group of glass-coated rods are fused together and drawn together in that state. Its disclosure is consistent with the Norton notebook memo of October 9, 1956, and discloses that the coatings of the multi-fiber unit are fused to each other. Certain revisions and an additional conference between patent counsel and Norton took place before the application was filed on July 3,1957.</p>

Having considered the question and the positions of the parties, as well as the authorities cited in their support, we now deny that motion. We find that the action taken by the Ass’t Commissioner in his decision on the initial petition to strike, citing the probability that the board would necessarily consider many of the matters relevant to the fraud question, and enjoining that body to make an appropriate recommendation under Rule 259 if it found fraud to exist, was tantamount in its effect to a direct delegation of the responsibility to make any further findings regarding the question of fraud.
