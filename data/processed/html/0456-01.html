Section 754 requires the existence of an intention to commit a larceny (or some other felony) coincident with the act of illegally entering any of the specified structures. Fletcher v. Robbins, <a href="/a2d/234/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="234 A.2d 636" data-case-ids="8093402" data-case-paths="/a2d/234/0636-01">234 A.2d 636</a> (Me.1967). In fact, without the existing intent required by the statute, a forceable entry of such a structure would not be a violation of this statute. Section 2103, on the other hand, does not <em>necessarily </em>require proof that the specific intent to commit the crime alleged to have been consummated while in the structure existed coincident with the unlawful entry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Although it can be conceded that in probably the greater number of cases such a specific intent at the time of entry is manifest in the proof of a violation of either statute, it is a fact not necessary to be proved in charges founded on Section 2103.</p>
    <p id="b496-10" data-blocks='[["BL_496.11",496,[987,744,752,905]]]'>We conclude that the indictment, as modified by the partial dismissal, was incapable of supporting a conviction (whether by verdict or plea) of a violation of Section 754. Absent such a supportive criminal pleading, the Court lacked jurisdiction (a matter always open to judicial scrutiny, Green v. State, <a href="/a2d/245/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="245 A.2d 147" data-case-ids="8067990" data-case-paths="/a2d/245/0147-01">245 A.2d 147</a> (Me.1968)) upon which to base the imposition of criminal sanctions. Even though a conviction following a guilty pleas may be attacked on direct appeal because of an insufficient indictment, State v. Kidder, <a href="/a2d/302/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="302 A.2d 320" data-case-ids="11250854" data-case-paths="/a2d/302/0320-01">302 A.2d 320</a> (Me.1973), because a valid indictment is a jurisdictional necessity, the conviction is likewise vulnerable on collateral attack. Ellis v. State, <a href="/a2d/276/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="276 A.2d 438" data-case-ids="8103181" data-case-paths="/a2d/276/0438-01">276 A.2d 438</a> (Me.1971); Haller v.
