On September 2, 1999, Appellant pleaded guilty to charges contained in one of the informations. On December 13, 1999, Appellant entered a guilty plea to a number of the charges in the remaining five informations and was sentenced on the September 2, 1999 guilty plea. The terms of the plea agreement were set forth as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b495-10" data-blocks='[["BL_495.10",495,[216,1695,710,611]]]'>THE COURT: You understand that Mr. Holmes [the district attorney] or the Commonwealth through Mr. Holmes has offered you kind of like a package agreement that you would receive a three year minimum sentence, you would be eligible for boot camp and that would encompass all the cases today, not just those I’ve gone over the charges with you, but also 99-10, 721, which I had taken a plea from you previously that was scheduled for sentencing today.</blockquote>

    <p id="b495-15" data-blocks='[["BL_495.13",495,[974,409,754,991]]]'>¶ 3 After an extensive colloquy, the trial court was informed that Appellant was currently serving a sentence at a seventh information, which was nine to twenty-three months incarceration (“county sentence”); this sentence had been imposed on August 2, 1999. The court noted that the plea agreement did not “speak to whether or not this [three-to-six-year sentence] runs consecutive or concurrent to that case that was sentenced in August.” <em>Id. </em>at 25. The trial court had a “feeling” that Appellant would be paroled on the county sentence once the sentence herein was imposed. <em>Id. </em>There was no discussion regarding the impact on Appellant’s eligibility for Boot Camp if the trial court imposed this sentence consecutively to the county sentence.</p>

The trial court expressly deemed Appellant eligible for the Boot Camp program but then ordered that the sentence on the six informations be served consecutively to the county sentence. Appellant was not paroled on the county sentence by the court that had imposed it. Therefore, when Appellant was transferred to prison, he began serving an aggregate prison sentence of three years and nine months, minimum, and seven years and eleven months, maximum, followed by twenty years probation. The length of this sentence precluded Appellant from participating in Boot Camp.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[177,391,752,1284]]]'>¶ 9 We have had two occasions to discuss the implication of a failed attempt to have the defendant enter the Boot Camp program when a guilty plea was entered in reliance upon Boot Camp eligibility. Appellant refers us to the one most directly applicable, <em>Commonwealth v. Hickman, </em><a href="/citations/?q=799%20A.2d%20186" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="799 A.2d 186">799 A.2d 186</a> (Pa.Super.2002), where counsel advised the defendant to plead guilty in exchange for a four-to-eight-year term of imprisonment. The defendant was reluctant to - accept the guilty plea, but was persuaded to do so once he was advised by counsel that he would be eligible for Boot Camp. The plea court deemed the defendant eligible for Boot Camp in its sentencing order. However, based on the length of his sentence, the defendant was not eligible for Boot Camp, and he filed a PCRA petition seeking to withdraw the plea. The PCRA court denied relief on the ground that there was never a guarantee that the defendant would have been accepted into Boot Camp even if he had been eligible.</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[175,1701,752,811]]]'>¶ 10 On appeal, we reversed and concluded that plea counsel’s erroneous advice that the defendant would be eligible for Boot Camp was not within the range of professionally competent assistance required under the sixth amendment. This assessment of counsel’s stewardship was premised upon counsel’s legally unsound advice, for which there was no reasonable basis designed to advance the defendant’s interest, that the defendant was eligible for Boot Camp when he was not due to the length of his sentence. We noted that the advice prejudiced the defendant in that it enticed him to enter a guilty plea when he would not otherwise have done so.</p>
    <p id="b497-7" data-blocks='[["BL_497.7",497,[176,2545,749,143]],["BL_497.8",497,[973,280,754,864]]]'>¶ 11 We also find guidance in <em>Commonwealth v. Zuber, </em><a href="/pa/466/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="466 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1715007" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0453-01">466 Pa. 453</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=853%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="853 A.2d 441">853 A.2d 441</a> (1976), where a defendant pleaded guilty on the expectation that the sentence would be served concurrently with a parole-violation recommitment sentence that would be imposed. However, under a sentencing statute then in effect, a parole violator sentenced to prison for another offense had to serve his back time on the parole sentence and the new sentence consecutively. Thus, the guilty plea agreement was legally impossible to fulfill. Our Supreme Court ruled that the defendant had to receive the benefit of his bargain such that the sentence imposed pursuant to the guilty plea had to be reduced to reflect the back time that the defendant would have to serve on the parole recommitment sentence.</p>
    <p id="b497-9" data-blocks='[["BL_497.9",497,[973,1179,753,715]]]'>¶ 12 Different circumstances were presented in <em>Commonwealth v.

In that case, however, the defendant was eligible statutorily for Boot Camp after entry of the plea agreement because his age, term of imprisonment, and the crimes to which he pled guilty all coalesced to render him a candidate for the program. However, he was not granted admittance.</p>

We did not permit the defendant to withdraw this guilty plea because the plea court did all that was required under the plea agreement, plea counsel did not mislead the defendant, the defendant actually was statutorily eligible for Boot Camp after the sentence was imposed, and there was no guarantee that he would be admitted into that program. <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>We noted that this lack of guarantee was obvious due to use of the term “eligible” and the express terms of the Motivational Boot Camp Act, which mandates that an inmate be approved by the motivational boot camp selection committee before he can participate in the program.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[179,660,751,456]]]'>¶ 14 In addition, in <em>Johnson, </em>the record substantiated that plea counsel specifically had informed the defendant that he could still be rejected by the committee for admittance to the Boot Camp program even if the judge determined that he was eligible.

    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[176,1160,755,819]]]'>¶ 15 Under this case law, we focus on whether a guilty plea was entered premised upon an expectation that was legally impossible to fulfill. In .the context of this case, the pertinent inquiry is whether after entry of the guilty plea and sentencing, Appellant actually was eligible for Boot Camp, thus meeting the express terms of the plea agreement. On the other hand, if after entry of the guilty plea and sentence, Appellant was statutorily precluded from admittance into the Boot Camp, then the guilty plea was violated because Appellant was not, in fact, “eligible” for Boot Camp, as envisioned by the negotiated guilty plea.</p>
    <p id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.7",498,[175,2022,756,658]],["BL_498.8",498,[977,275,749,874]]]'>¶ 16 In the present case, the PCRA court claims that the plea court attempted to abide by the plea agreement because it believed that Appellant would be paroled on the county sentence and if that had occurred, Appellant would have been Boot Camp eligible. We simply cannot agree with that proposition. Once the court sentenced Appellant herein consecutively with the county sentence, Appellant became ineligible for Boot Camp. Thus, the plea court actually erred when it stated that it was not clear whether under the terms of plea agreement, the-county sentence and this sentence had to be served concurrently. The plea court stated that it had a “feeling” that Appellant would be paroled from the county sentence once it imposed its sentence herein. This unsubstantiated and incorrect belief cannot be considered a good faith effort to sentence Appellant in accordance with the terms of the express plea agreement. Appellant was misled in this respect. If the plea court was to ensure that Appellant was Boot Camp eligible, as required by the agreement, it had to have sentenced concurrently with the county sentence. Once sentenced herein, Appellant became ineligible for Boot Camp.</p>

He asks that we remand for a sentencing adjustment that would give him as close to the benefit of his bargain as possible. <em>See Zuber, supra, see Hickman, supra. </em>In the alternative, he asks for permission to withdraw his guilty plea.
