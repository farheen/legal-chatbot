He punched her with his fists and chased her while hitting her on the head with a wooden board. He then grabbed her and threw her to the ground, striking and kicking her until she was unconscious. During the attack she dislodged four teeth, suffered cuts on her cheeks, a lump on her forehead, cuts and swelling on her arm, a black eye and bruised hips and ribs.</p>

The judge reconvened the hearing and the Commonwealth called two witnesses, Assistant District Attorney Kyle Birch and the victim. Mr. Birch testified that he was sitting in the back of the courtroom, and that while the Appellant walked by the row where the victim was seated, he said, “I’ll be out one day.” The victim corroborated Mr. Birch’s testimony. Appellant, still represented by the attorney who represented him at trial, called his mother as a witness and she testified that the Appellant directed his statement to her, in response to a question about when she could see him again. The court considered the testimony and the arguments of counsel before holding Appellant in contempt of court and sentencing him to an additional three months to five months and twenty-nine days in prison.</p>

Furthermore, the judge did not actually hear him say the words, “I’ll be out one day.” However, we have long recognized that acts such as jury tampering and witness intimidation that occur outside the physical presence of the court, but that interfere with its immediate business, are punishable as contempt. <em>Snyder’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/301/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="301 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1126384" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0276-01">301 Pa. 276</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%2033" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="152 A. 33">152 A. 33</a> (1930).

Because an individual can be cited for contempt based on statements made outside the courtroom, it follows that when an individual makes a remark in the courtroom while the judge is physically present, he cannot avoid a conviction for contempt simply because the judge did not hear him speak the words in question.</p>

Therefore, he argues that his words did not disrupt the proceedings, and accordingly he did not commit contempt. An obstruction of the administration of justice requires “a showing of actual, imminent prejudice to a fair proceeding or the preservation of the court’s authority.” <em>Garrison </em>at 372, <a href="/pa/478/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="478 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1740572" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0356-01">386 A.2d at 979</a>. By uttering a threat in the courtroom and in the presence of the judge, the Appellant indicated that his conviction and sentencing would not deter him from harming the victim. Through his words, he belittled the trial court’s attempt to administer justice and protect the person he had violently attacked. Furthermore, the fact that the Appellant threatened a witness who had just testified against him made it especially important that the court vindicate its authority by holding him in contempt. To have permitted the Appellant to use the courtroom to intimidate his victim, and thereby possibly deter others from testifying in the future, would clearly obstruct the efficient administration of justice and demean the court’s authority. Accordingly, we hold that threats made in a courtroom in the presence of a judge may constitute a sufficient basis for a finding of criminal contempt, even if the judicial proceeding has concluded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.9",180,[209,583,751,563]]]'>I respectfully dissent. As Appellant’s statement was made after the sentencing hearing had concluded, it did not obstruct the administration of justice and therefore cannot support a conviction for criminal contempt. As noted by the majority, 42 Pa.C.S. § 4132 limits a court’s contempt powers to eases of official misconduct of court officers, disobedience or neglect of or to the lawful process of the court, and misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice.</p>

A showing of actual, imminent prejudice to a fair proceeding or to the preservation of the court’s authority must be established. <em><a href="/pa/478/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="478 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1740572" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0356-01">Id.</a> </em>It is undisputed that Appellant’s comment was wholly inappropriate considering the previous threats he had made towards the victim. However, because it was made after the sentencing hearing had concluded, the proper sanction was not a finding of contempt. The comment did not render the proceeding unfair, nor did it prejudice the preservation of the court’s authority.</p>

I would reverse the judgment of sentence as to the contempt conviction.</p>
