    <p id="b674-6" data-blocks='[["BL_674.6",674,[168,563,755,758]]]'>The plaintiff, Malek Ahmed, has appealed from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, attorney Constance Pannone, in this legal malpractice action. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 9, 2001, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time.</p>
    <p id="b674-7" data-blocks='[["BL_674.7",674,[163,1356,755,552]]]'>In July 1993, defendant was hired by plaintiff to represent him in a case titled <em>Ahmed v. Loft, </em>C.A. No. 92-6826 (Loft action), after plaintiff already had filed <em>pro se </em>a complaint and an amended complaint. In September 1993, defendant entered into a stipulation with opposing counsel, dismissing plaintiffs <em>pro se </em>complaints “without prejudice.” The defendant then filed a “second amended complaint” in the Loft action'in or about November 1993.</p>
    <p id="b674-8" data-blocks='[["BL_674.8",674,[164,1941,753,457]]]'>In February 1994, the defendants in the Loft action filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, or, in the alternative, a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. Before the hearing on the motion to dismiss was held, defendant withdrew as plaintiffs attorney.</p>
    <p id="b674-9" data-blocks='[["BL_674.9",674,[166,2425,751,89]]]'>Rule 41(a)(1)(h) provides in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b674-14" data-blocks='[["BL_674.12",674,[967,601,755,1130]]]'>At a hearing in August 1994, a Superior Court justice found that plaintiff had dismissed two, and possibly three, previous claims arising from the same facts, and he therefore granted the Rule 41(a)(1) motion. The plaintiff then filed the instant malpractice action against defendant, alleging that her execution of the dismissal stipulation in the Loft action caused him damage. The defendant responded with a motion for summary judgment that was granted after a hearing in November 1999. The motion justice reasoned that it was plaintiffs failure to appeal the dismissal of the Loft action that ultimately caused that suit to be dismissed after defendant withdrew her representation of plaintiff. The justice also noted that plaintiff was unable to establish that the dismissal of the Loft action resulted from a breach of the standard of care owed by defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</p>

The plaintiffs assertion that defendant’s filing of a stipulation of dismissal in the Loft action caused him damages is speculative in light of plaintiffs failure to appeal or make a motion to vacate the granting of the Rule 41(a)(1) motion. Contrary to plaintiffs assertions, nothing prevented him from appealing that ruling.</p>
