After hearing arguments of counsel and considering defendant’s brief, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was correct in refusing to accept that portion of the arbitration record which consist<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>ed only of exhibits, the parties having stipulated before the arbitrators that no transcription or recording of the arbitration proceedings be made. We are also of the opinion that the trial justice applied the correct rule of law in confirming the award. Westminster <em>Const. Corp. v.
