He was charged with several counts of murder in the first degree: the mtentional murder of Michelle, and the felony murders of Fawn, Tabitha, and Charles Humbertson. The felony murder counts were based on 11 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 636(a)(2), wMch provides that a person is guilty of first <a id="p1339" href="#p1339" data-label="1339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1339</a>degree murder if “[i]n the course of ... a felony ... he recklessly causes the death of another person.” The jury convicted Lawrie of the first degree felony murders of his two daughters and Charles Humbertson.

    <p id="b1405-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1405.4",1405,[144,641,753,606]]]'>Lawrie asserts for the first time on this appeal two errors in the jury instructions: (1) failure to instruct the jury regarding the elements of criminally negligent felony murder because that crime, according to Lawrie, is a lesser included offense of reckless felony murder, and (2) failure properly to instruct the jury on the burden of proof with regard to the non-statutory aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances. Since these issues were not raised at the trial level, we have considered them under the plain error standard of review.</p>
    <p id="b1405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1405.5",1405,[142,1268,755,701]]]'>After determining guilt, the jury considered the penalty phase. By a vote of 9 to 3, the jury determined that the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweighed the mitigating circumstances found to exist. Following his own assessment of the relevant circumstances, and with due regard for the jury’s recommendation, the Superior Court concluded that it was more likely than not that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.

The trial court also considered several non-statutory aggravating circumstances, including Lawrie’s conduct while in prison (he had two violent encounters with other inmates) and the impact of the deaths on the victims’ families.</p>

Around Thanksgiving of 1991 Lawrie moved to Florida with his family, but returned to Dover in early January 1992. Michelle remained in Florida with Fawn and Tabitha until late January 1992, when they returned to Dover. Lawrie experienced numerous problems in 1992, including sporadic unemployment, use of crack cocaine, and separation from his wife.</p>

Lawrie was arrested and charged with terroristic threatening and offensive touching. On August 5,1992, Law-rie pleaded guilty to the terroristic threatening charge in Family Court. He was placed on probation and ordered to have no contact with his wife. As Lawrie was leaving Family Court, Michelle told him that she was filing for divorce. Lawrie testified that, on the night of August 5, he smoked crack cocaine <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in order to relax, but that it instead increased his anger. He also brooded over statements from friends and family members that Michelle had been unfaithful to him.</p>

Two neighborhood children, Charles Humbertson (age 4) and Lisa Humbertson (age 8), were also in the house. Lawrie brought a two-gallon can of gasoline with him to the house and kicked in the back door. Lawrie also had a knife with him in the house.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> After Lawrie broke into the house, he began pouring gasoline around the living room where Fawn and the Hum-bertson children were playing. The children fled to the bedroom where Michelle and Tabitha were located. Lawrie then ignited the gasoline with a lighter. Lawrie claimed at trial that he did not intend to kill anyone, but instead wanted to “scare the hell out of Michelle.” As the living room rapidly became engulfed in flames, Lawrie went into the bedroom and stabbed Michelle several times with the knife. Lawrie claimed that the stabbing was accidental and reflexive.</p>

Lawrie then obtained a step ladder, placed it near the window, and helped Lisa Humbert-son escape. Lawrie testified that he asked Michelle to hand him the other children, but did not receive any response. By this time, thick smoke was pouring out of the window. Michelle, Fawn, Tabitha, and Charles Hum-bertson died in the fire. Lawrie fled to the home of a neighbor, and told the neighbor what'he had done. The neighbor called the police, and Lawrie waited at the neighbor’s home until the police arrived. He was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced as outlined above.</p>

Based on this testimony and other evidence, the jury convicted Lawrie of arson in the first degree and burglary in the second degree, as well as first degree felony murder under 11 <em>Del.

The 1915 codification of Delaware law imposed a mandatory death sentence on individuals found guilty of committing murder with express malice aforethought or of committing murder while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate any crime punishable by death, including treason, rape, or kidnapping. Revised Code of Delaware ¶4697 (1915). Later code revisions retained these death penalty provisions. <em>See </em>Revised Code of Delaware ch. 149, ¶5157, § 1 (1935); 11 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 571 (1953). In 1958 the General Assembly amended the code to abolish execution as a criminal penalty in Delaware. 51 Del.Laws ch. 347 (1958). In 1961, in apparent response to the murder of an elderly couple, the General Assembly restored execution as the mandatory penalty for first degree murder. <em>Flamer, </em><a href="/a2d/490/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="490 A.2d 104" data-case-ids="7894704" data-case-paths="/a2d/490/0104-01">490 A.2d at </a>121 n. 1.</p>

The court found that Rodriguez was a “major participant in the attempted robbery/murder,” but there was no evidence that Rodriguez fired the shots or that he anticipated a killing. Slip op. at 43-45.
