    <p id="b84-15" data-blocks='[["BL_84.16",84,[1009,698,751,873]]]'>The plaintiffs, James R. Gibson and Jane H. Gibson, live in Wilmington, Delaware, but own a piece of property located on the scenic shores of Lake Comegys, in Sussex County. They desire to build there a three unit townhouse (the “Project”), from which they, and the purchasers of the other two units, might enjoy the natural beauty that surrounds them — albeit from 3,200 square feet of air-conditioned comfort. The Gibsons are not the first couple to become enamored of this particular iteration of the American dream; indeed, as we shall see, it is, in- no small part, the pioneers who pursued that dream near Lake Comegys first whose vociferous objections have led the Gibsons to this court.</p>
    <p id="b84-16" data-blocks='[["BL_84.17",84,[1011,1599,749,820]]]'>Because the zoning requirements of Sussex County demanded it, the Gibsons sought the permission first of the Sussex County Planning and Zoning Commission (the “Zoning Commission”) and then of the Sussex County Council (“County Council”) to build the Project. The Gibsons received approval from the Zoning Commission because they had satisfied all the statutory and regulatory criteria the Commission deemed relevant. But, they were ultimately denied permission by the County Council. The Gibsons come before this court seeking redress, contending that the County Council acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying their application.</p>
    <p id="b84-17" data-blocks='[["BL_84.18",84,[1010,2447,748,246]],["BL_85.1",85,[169,277,751,1755]]]'>Because this question of whether the County Council’s actions were within the bounds of its discretion must be assessed against the facts of record, the Gibsons and the County Council have both moved <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>for summary judgment, arguing that different legal conclusions ought to be drawn from the undisputed record. This opinion resolves those cross motions, and finds that the County Council’s decision regarding the Gibsons’ property was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to logically incorporate, or even respond to, the record facts that had been assessed and considered by its expert subordinate committee, the Zoning Commission, in approving the Project. Put simply, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the County Council’s rejection of the Project was driven by a desire to please the opponents of the Project, and not by rational factors pertinent to the decision before the Council. In making a land use approval decision of this kind, the Council is not free to bend to the prevailing breeze, but must rationally and fairly apply its zoning code and regulations. That did not occur here and instead the Gibsons were subjected to an ad hoc exercise of power. Although some of the considerations raised by the public are rational considerations for the formulation of land use policy, they are considerations that the County Council must address in a legislative fashion and not in an arbitrary fashion that subjects some property owners like the Gibsons to unwritten, subjective restrictions that the Council is not willing to impose on similarly situated property owners.</p>

It consists of a quarter acre, or 11,850 square feet, and is nestled between Pine Lane to the North, and the shores of Lake Comegys to the South. Notably, the Property is also located in an area where two roads — Pine Lane and Silver Lake Drive — also come very close to Lake Comegys. The one road, Silver Lake Drive, known as King Charles Avenue closer to Dewey Beach, is a heavily traveled thoroughfare between Rehoboth and Dewey Beach. The entire area surrounding both Lake Comegys and the adjacent Silver Lake, just on the other side of Silver Lake Drive, is dotted with houses, many of which are very large. Surrounding Silver Lake, for example, is another small community<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that includes some enormous houses. At several points along Silver Lake, public roads come very close to the water’s edge.</p>
    <p id="b85-9" data-blocks='[["BL_85.8",85,[968,1212,751,466]]]'>As Delawareans know, we have no actual “lakes” in our state. By mid-western standards, Lake Comegys barely qualifies as a pond, rather than a puddle. For our local purposes, it is a modest-sized pond and I will call it the “Pond” for short. Likewise, Silver Lake, although far larger than Lake Comegys, is also, by any honest and objective standard, a pond.</p>
    <p id="b85-10" data-blocks='[["BL_85.9",85,[965,1721,753,726]]]'>The Property is located in a zoning district designated Medium Density Residential (“MR”). For many years, a residence sat on the Property that was built approximately ten to fifteen feet from the Pond. In 2002, the Gibsons donated this structure to First State Community Action Agency, which intended to move the home to a new location; unfortunately the move proved impossible and the structure was destroyed. The lot has remained vacant since that time, a condition that, as we shall see, others in the neighborhood apparently enjoyed.</p>
    <p id="b86-3" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[201,281,750,393]]]'>
      <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>In September 2008, the Gibsons proposed to build the Project on the vacant lot. Their purpose seems obvious. By building a three unit townhouse, they can finance the construction of a new residence for themselves in an economically feasible manner, using the proceeds from the sale of the other two units.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[198,706,752,557]]]'>If they had the wherewithal and the desire, the Gibsons would be free to build a single family home on the Property that is even larger than the Project. That is, they could build a home (or sell to someone who intended to build a home) as large as some of the ones that loom near Silver Lake. The reason for that is that the MR designation allows for certain permitted uses, such as the building of a single family dwelling.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[195,1287,752,608]]]'>But, the Gibsons’ Project, despite being residential in nature, falls under another category of use — that of a conditional use. In the MR zones of Sussex County, multifamily dwelling structures are classified as conditional uses. Conditional uses, as the term implies, require that the property owner meet the added condition of clearing his intended use with the County in advance of building. In this case, that process proceeded through the following steps.</p>
    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.7",86,[195,1920,752,555]],["BL_86.8",86,[999,280,748,469]]]'>Because the Silver Lake Heights community does not he within the corporate limits of any city or town' — -even though it is nestled tightly between Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach — the Gibsons submitted their application to Sussex County, specifically to that body of county government responsible for the first review of conditional use applications, the Zoning Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The application, seeking permission to build a single building containing three townhouses on the site, was filed September 8, 2003 and assigned the application number CU # 1540. The Zoning Commission, however, does not have the final say in approving or denying the application; instead, it provides a non-binding recommendation to the body that does have that decision-making authority, the County Council.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

No discussion or debate of the Zoning Commission’s findings ensued; instead, the recommendation was promptly voted upon and rejected by a vote of 4 to 1. It is this determination that the Gibsons allege was arbitrary and capricious. Several of the Councilmen<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> indicated the reasons for their votes in the transcript of that proceeding. Because my analysis of the legal question breaks down these reasons in detail, I deal with the specific reasons provided by the Councilmen in my analysis below. These reasons, however, are summarized in the approved minutes of the August 3, 2004 meeting of the County Council which provide in relevant part:</p>

In the 2003 Plan, the Council contends <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>that the neighborhood was no longer designated as a Development District, but instead had been designated as part of an “Environmentally Sensitive Developing Area,” a new designation that “can be defined as a Developing District with special environmental design and protection requirement[s].”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Although both parties addressed this issue in briefing and at argument, whether this designation applied to the Gibsons’ Property, given that the area clearly was and continues to be an MR zone, remained unclear. After reviewing the record I am now convinced that the area in question is indeed located in an Environmentally Sensitive Developing Area, though the map pictorially representing this fact is, to put it generously, less than clear on this point.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> The confusion arises because the “district” system used for land planning is separate and distinct from the zoning system which is also shown on the map.

In reviewing the concerns that faced the County Council — that the structure might be too tall, that it might create runoff or other environmental problems, that its size or design might not be “compatible” with the existing architecture, and that it might be built too close to the Pond and thereby damage it — one must compare these dangers not against the remote possibility that the lot,would remain empty, but against the risks that might be created if the Gibsons built (or sold to someone who built) a palatial dream house instead of three townhouse units.</p>

The concerns expressed in these communications largely parallel the several reasons that the Councilmen offer in defense of their decision that are addressed below. Interestingly, the views of the opponents are ones that might rationally form the foundation for a consistent legislative approach limiting the scope, nature, and effect of development on our state’s waterways, as well as the way in which residents near waterways live.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> But the opponents did not come before the County Council advocating rules of general application, they came before the Council arguing implicitly that the Gibsons be subjected to unspecified, ad hoc restrictions that, if adopted in a written, defined, rational and non-arbitrary way, would expose the fact that many of these opponents live in houses, or even townhouses, near the Pond and Silver Lake made of metaphorical glass.</p>

Because of this, the implicit logic of the typical conditional use, that a legislative determination had been made in favor of that use in a particular zone, was most likely inapt. As a result, Vice Chancellor Hartnett found that an application for the conditional use of a borrow pit in Sussex County was more akin to a rezoning and therefore reasoned that it should be treated as one. Per this ruling, <em>Steen </em>held that applicants before the County Council had to “establish that the grant of the Conditional Use Permit will be consistent with the factors mandated by 9 <em>Del.

For example, in agricultural residential districts, they are not permitted, even as a conditional use, and in high density residential districts, they are a permitted use as opposed to a conditional one, do not require an application to the County Council, and may be built by a property owner as a matter of right.

In light of the fact that no evidence of the likelihood of harm <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>was established, and that the County’s own body charged with investigating the environmental soundness of the plans approved the project, I find no rational reason to deny the conditional use on environmental impact grounds, especially given that the Council did not appear to rely heavily on such grounds in making its determination, and that there would appear to be no significant increase in harm (and indeed perhaps less) in permitting the conditional use as opposed to having the Gibsons build a large home on the shore of the Pond, as is them right. Notably, in that last regard, the pre-existing structure on the Property was located the same distance from the Pond as the Project will be.</p>

Clearly, if no such development existed, wildlife of all kinds would find those areas an attractive refuge, having a much safer area to traverse (no threat of death by vehicle, e.g.), and cleaner water (no nutrient-producing run off, e.g.) to swim in and drink. The denial of the Gibsons’ application, however, did not rationally begin a serious plan for environmental restoration in these long-developed areas. Whether the Gibsons develop the Property or not, the surrounding community will burden wildlife and water quality by their actions, by driving on roads close to the Pond and Silver Lake, cutting their lawns, and simply by living there.

Indeed, by connecting this observation with traffic concerns, Councilman Cole seems to imply that further increased development, along the lines of that contemplated by the Gibsons, might lead to congestion. Such a concern is speculative at best, and finds no support in the record that expressly established that the Gib-sons’ plan would not adversely affect traffic or congestion. Similarly, if the Gib-sons’ plan had exceeded height or density limits as established by the relevant zoning laws, and they sought an exception to those restrictions, this rationale would have some teeth. In the absence of concerns of this nature, however, this “slippery slope” argument reduces to: “if we let you follow the law and abide by the limitations provided in our Code and Comprehensive Plan, sooner or later we are going to have to let other property owners abide by these limits and, well ... that would be catastrophic.”</p>

    <p id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.7",107,[166,931,751,975]]]'>The law requires that local governments deal with specific land use decisions in a rational, non-arbitrary manner guided by legislative standards of general application. The singling out of particular owners for idiosyncratic treatment, just because the prevailing neighborhood wind is unfavorable, is not acceptable when the property owner has met all the criteria that the local government has established for the requested conditional use. The inequity thus created becomes more poignant, when much of the community opposition amounts mostly to the plea that the opponents — most of whom are posing exactly the same threats to the Pond and Silver Lake as the applicants’ proposed use supposedly would — be permitted to close the door to the community behind them.</p>

Chairman Dukes, recognizing that this was a sensitive and emotional application from a political perspective, nevertheless voted yes after recognizing the relevant facts: “[tjhere are 28 townhouses already around the lake, only nine single-family homes. They’ll not be encroaching any closer to the lake then what they already were with their single-family home they had there. And speculation was that they’ll be damaging Lake Comegys; that’s only speculation, I did not find any evidence where any harm would be done because of the proposed construction.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_86" id="ref_footnote_1_86">86</a> One senses that he might have preferred to vote with the other four Councilmen, but could not find a principled justification for doing so.</p>

The Gibsons’ Project satisfied the Zoning Commission because that Commission applied the appropriate criteria. The Gibsons should not have to suffer further delay or expense, absent the existence of non-arbitrary reasons that would justify the Council denying their application if a new hearing were held. In that regard, I do not consider it equitable to subject the Gibsons to a round of bargaining with the Council, whereby the Council proposes that the Gibsons agree to move the construction a bit back from the Pond, downsize the Project, or make other concessions that the Council and the Zoning Commission could have long ago suggested as a reasonable compromise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_89" id="ref_footnote_1_89">89</a>

The problem is that those concerns cannot, in our system of government, be addressed solely through the imposition of ad hoc burdens on individual property owners like the Gibsons. It may well be that environmental concerns should, in the future, lead the Council to amend the Code to curtail development around freshwater ponds and streams, and to require existing property owners to manage run-off and other activities in a manner that promotes water quality and wildlife health. It may well be that it is better for the community for structures to be smaller or for there to be less density, and the Council can legislate to implement that sentiment, if it wishes. And so on and so forth. But the means of addressing goals of this type must be through neutral criteria of general applicability, which afford individual property owners fair and predictable treatment under rules of the game that apply to all who are similarly situated.</p>

To the extent that § 6904 bears on the inquiry, therefore, it applies to the burden on the County Council to articulate a non-arbitrary reason for the denial that is reasonably related to public health, safety or welfare. <em>See Steen, </em><a href="/a2d/576/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="576 A.2d 642" data-case-ids="7385719" data-case-paths="/a2d/576/0642-01">576 A.2d at 649</a>. Unlike in <em>Steen, </em>no substantial evidence before the Council rationally supported the idea that members of the community would be injured by the Gib-sons’ proposed use, and no substantial evidence existed showing a threat of environmental harm or increased congestion in the community. As important, the approval of the Project would tend to concentrate population in an already heavily populated part of our state’s beach resort areas, thereby more rationally utilizing infrastructure and alleviating pressure for sprawl into more pristine areas. The Council’s litigation position that the construction of residences can never promote the public welfare under § 6904 is untenable. The obvious purpose of § 6904 is to encourage the rational development of communities, which by their very definition include dwellings for their residents. Under its position, the Gibsons could create, I suppose, a youth recreation center open to all, with the same burden on the Pond, and satisfy § 6904 easily, if not necessarily the Sussex Zoning Code, or perhaps a group home of some sort to serve a disadvantaged population. Such plans, one suspects, would be even more objectionable to the Gibsons’ neighbors than the Project.</p>

Because it is not practicable to restore the shores of Silver Lake, Lake Comegys, and other heavily settled areas of the beach resorts (how about Lake Gerar) to their pristine state, the Comprehensive Plan in fact seeks to concentrate development where it is already far along, thus preserving other areas that are more environmentally pristine and untouched. Frankly, a look at the Lake Come-gys community also points out that denying the Gibsons’ multifamily use would not preserve the neighborhood. Giant single family homes loom near Silver Lake and are very close to Lake Comegys. The Gibsons have an unfettered right to build one of those. That they wish to build a townhouse of 38 feet — ■ four feet less than the maximum — ten feet back from the pond, will do nothing to change the fundamental character of the area — which will remain one characterized by a large number of residential structures all centering on a small pond, in a relatively densely and heavily traveled portion of our resort areas.</p>

The logic of my decision in this regard finds resonance in other related areas of our law. Where a homeowners’ association seeks to maintain a certain character in a development through restrictive covenants, for example, a similar tension arises between the intent of the community and its ability to protect that intent, and the traditional rights of properly owners to do what they will with their property. Where a community attempts to impose such restrictions on a homeowner via restrictive covenants, this court is often called upon to enforce such strictures. As a general rule, this court has established that provisions of this nature are enforceable when they are clear, precise and capable of evenhanded application. <em>See Bethany Village Owners Ass’n, Inc. v. Fontana, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20695570" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="1997 WL 695570">1997 WL 695570</a>, at *2 (Del.Ch. Oct.9 1997).
