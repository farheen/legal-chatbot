Commonwealth agencies such as DCNR are vested with implied powers necessary to effectuate their statutory mandates. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

It is equally apparent, here, that the General Assembly intended that DCNR, as the custodian and trustee of public property including “some of our State’s most precious and rare natural areas,” 71 P.S. § 1340.101(a)(2), have the ability to negotiate agreements with subsurface owners,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and restrain unreasonable incursions onto the surface of Commonwealth lands.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

As the Department persuasively argues, the inquiry before the Department of Environmental Protection may overlap, but is not entirely coterminous, with DCNR’s own assessment of the impact of an overall drilling operation (including the creation of avenues of ingress and egress) on the natural resources comprising a State park.</p>

As the present proceedings exemplify, a subsurface owner may seek redress in a judicial forum. Although I recognize that this involves delay and inconvenience, the alternative is to deprive the Department of a substantial means to discharge its obligation to guard and protect vital Commonwealth resources. The seminal decision in <em>Charti-ers Block Coal Co. v. Mellon, </em><a href="/pa/152/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="152 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="838184" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0286-01">152 Pa. 286</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.%20597" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="25 A. 597">25 A. 597</a> (1893), recognizes the reality that these types of land-rights disputes present complex matters involving the ordering of competing and compelling interests and are subject to litigation. <em>See Chartiers, </em><a href="/pa/152/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="152 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="838184" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0286-01">152 Pa. at 298</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.%20597" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="25 A. 597">25 A. at 599</a>. Although <em>Chartiers </em>shows an appreciation of the difficult balancing which must occur to protect the various rights in tension and the importance of achieving a solution that permits all owners to enjoy the beneficial use of their property to the fullest extent possible, the <em>Chartiers </em>Court simply did not undertake to specify who must be the plaintiff and who must be the defendant in litigation over those interests.</p>
    <p id="Avz" data-blocks='[["BL_562.7",562,[988,1152,752,586]]]'>On a cautionary note, while mineral rights holders must act with due regard to the public interest in accessing public lands, the Department must also act with due regard to the private interests. To the degree that DCNR misjudges the reasonableness of a subsurface owner’s conduct and unduly restrains it, it is acting in derogation of substantial private rights and interests which are also protected by the Constitution, and which the courts are open and available to vindicate.</p>
    <p id="b562-8" data-blocks='[["BL_562.11",562,[986,1762,754,486]],["BL_563.1",563,[124,294,756,1402]]]'>In light of the above, I believe the outcome of this proceeding as it has been framed should depend on the reasonableness of the conditions DCNR required of Appellee (or, stated differently, the reasonableness of Appellee’s ingress and operations in the parklands in the absence of such conditions), rather than upon any universal proposition that the Department has no authority to require conditions or re<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>strain unreasonable activity in any way other than resorting to the courts. Indeed, the gravamen of Count I of Appel-lee’s petition for review was the assertion that its past and proposed conduct was and will be, in fact, reasonable without the Department’s conditions. <em>See </em>Petition for Review ¶ 13 (“Because Belden &amp; Blake has, among other rights, an implied easement to enter the subject parcels and exercise its rights in a reasonable fashion, <em>and because Belden &amp; Blake has acted reasonably </em>and in excess of what the law requires of an easement holder, DCNR cannot hinder Belden &amp; Blake’s oil and gas operations ...” (emphasis added)). While the Commonwealth Court awarded summary judgment on this count, its opinion contains no developed, fact-bound reasonableness assessment. As the Department emphasizes, the court also does not appear to have undertaken any balancing of the parties’ respective rights and interests. Thus, it seems apparent, to me at least, that Appellee was not entitled to the full measure of requested declaratory relief based on the reasoning developed by the court.</p>
    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[125,1727,752,292]],["BL_563.5",563,[924,293,753,1361]]]'>The Commonwealth Court did make brief mention of each condition proposed by DCNR in its analysis, but its conclusions were based on the proposition, stated with a fair degree of abstraction, that the Department had no authority to impose each of them. Therefore, from the opinion, it is not possible to determine with confidence whether the court’s conclusions were based on the nature of the specific conditions in view of the particular facts and circumstances presented, or the more global proposition that the Department has no authority to limit access according to any conditions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> In these circumstances, and in light of my conclusion that a blanket rule is inappropriate, I would remand for further development of the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning and a fuller explanation of the nature of the declaratory relief awarded. To the degree the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion, consistent with Appellee’s request for declaratory relief, is that Appellee’s conduct and plans are reasonable, I believe some factual development may be necessary. I would admonish, however, in light of Ap-pellee’s undisputed right of access, that the initial burden of proof appropriately rests with the Department to demonstrate the reasonableness of conditions it seeks to impose. <em>Cf.

I also would not foreclose the requirement of security in the event DCNR could demonstrate that a particular operator was financially unstable.
