G. 847; 1908 C. D. 210). In this interference it so clearly appears that Eger’s disclosure does not support the count that this procedure will be adopted.</blockquote>
    <p id="b731-5" data-blocks='[["BL_731.5",731,[84,741,1325,85]]]'>In holding that appellant Eger could not make the count in issue, the Examiner of Interferences said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b731-6" data-blocks='[["BL_731.6",731,[83,870,1326,492]]]'>The deficiencies of Eger’s disclosure with respect to the count are two in number. One of these is that his application does not show or set forth “a cap member secured to said body element.” If, as Eger states in his application and brief, the member 4 shown in Eig. 2 of his drawing is a cap member, and it is thought that broadly it is entitled to that designation, then it is not shown “secured” to the body element 15. “Secured” means <em>fastened </em>and the body element 15 is not shown or described as being able to be made fast to the cap 4. In the Watson disclosure there is shown a threaded connection between the body element and the cap but the body element 15 of the. Eger device is at all times not fastened but is yieldingly positioned by means of a spring in suspended relation with respect to a member 9 which is in turn threaded to the cap member 4.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b731-7" data-blocks='[["BL_731.7",731,[84,1372,1326,659]]]'>The other deficiency is in respect to a “chember” required by the count as being “formed intermediate the ends of said bore.” Due to the terms of the count otherwise it follows that the chamber referred to must of necessity bo of a larger diameter than the bore, a condition not subscribed to in the Eger device. According to the terms of the count the “stem member” includes “a bore therethrough and a chamber formed intermediate the ends of said bore” and from this it follows that the chamber should be able to be distinguished from the bore. The count further requires “a body element * * * including a valve head of greater diameter than said bore and less in diameter than said chamber” and it follows from this limitation that the chamber is distinguishable from the bore at least by the fact of its having a greater diameter than the bore. Eger’s disclosure shows a bore 14 but no chamber distinguishable from it. All elements of the count must be regarded as material and Eger’s application is thus clearly lacking in disclosure of two material elements. Because of this state of circumstances priority will be awarded the party Watson.</blockquote>
    <p id="b731-8" data-blocks='[["BL_731.8",731,[83,2060,1328,393]],["BL_732.1",732,[202,256,1328,96]]]'>Tlie examiner further stated in his decision that as the appellate tribunals might take a different view as to appellant Eger’s right to make the count (appellant having submitted no evidence, relying upon the filing date of his application for conception and constructive reduction to practice), he would consider the evidence submitted by appellee Watson. Considering the evidence of appellee Watson in the light of his views as to the proper construction to be given the language of the count, the Examiner of Interferences held <a id="p1414" href="#p1414" data-label="1414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1414</a>that appellee bad failed to establish conception, of the invention prior to appellant’s filing date.</p>
    <p id="b732-4" data-blocks='[["BL_732.4",732,[205,356,1324,192]]]'>On appeal by appellant, the Board of Appeals disagreed with the examiner’s views regarding the proper construction to be placed upon the language of the count in issue, and held that appellant was entitled to make the count. In so holding, the board said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b732-5" data-blocks='[["BL_732.5",732,[204,583,1328,326]]]'>It is his [the Examiner of Interferences] view that the cap member is not secured to the body element of the valve. In the Watson device the cap fe connected by screw threads with the body element, but in the Eger construction the body element is prevented from escaping from the cap by the intermediate agency of a spring and a spring seat. We are of the opinion that these intermediate elements may be regarded as acting to secure the two parts together. The fact that there is some play between these parts we do not regard as material.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b732-6" data-blocks='[["BL_732.6",732,[205,920,1328,1068]]]'>The examiner has also held that Eger does not show a chamber formed intermediate the ends of the bore in the stem member. <em>The Mger drawing does not show any reduction m the sige of the bore as it approaches the tire tube in the manner disclosed by Watson and we cam, agree with the exammer that when the language of this portion of the count is given the usual meaning it does not. appear to read upon the Mger structure. </em>We find, however, that the count specifies in effect that the valve head seals the stem when it is forced into the bore and permits the flow of air when in the chamber. If this language is to be given the usual meaning, this portion of the count is confusing as the' introductory portion would indicate that the entire opening through the stem is to be regarded as the bore and, therefore, that the valve head must always be in the bore. In view of this inconsistency in the count, we believe that it is necessary to construe it in such a manner as to give it a reasonable meaning at least when applied to the disclosure of the party Watson. We think that the reasonable interpretation is that <em>the bore contains a constriction which is smaller than the valve head against which the head is forced to prevent am- flow and that the bore adjacent this constriction is sufficiently large so• as to form a chamber or passageway through which flow may occur when the head is moved away from the constriction into it. </em>When the count is construed' in this manner, we believe that it reads upon the Eger construction. We recognize that usually limitations should not be read into a claim or the language construed as different from its ordinary meaning but in an interference proceeding where a count is found to be inaccurate, it is believed that it is sometimes advisable to construe it in the light of the disclosures of the parties. <em>This does not mean, however, that it is necessary for the examiner to allow the claim to issue m its objectionable form. </em>[Italics ours.]</blockquote>
    <p id="b732-7" data-blocks='[["BL_732.7",732,[203,2022,1330,446]]]'>The board then considered the evidence submitted by appellee Watson, evidently in the light of the construction it had placed upon the language of the count, and held that appellee had established conception of the invention defined by the count in the late summer of 1932, about a month prior to the filing (September 28, 1932) of appellant’s application; that appellee was diligent at the time appellant entered the field, and thereafter until he reduced the invention to practice on or about October 27, 1932; and, accordingly, awarded priority of invention to appellee.</p>

    <p id="b733-4" data-blocks='[["BL_733.4",733,[83,559,1325,536]]]'>It clearly appears from appellant’s application that the bore in his device “is of the same diameter,” as stated in the brief of counsel for appellant, “from the valve seat to the inner end of the stem in place of being formed of two different portions, one of which is of sufficient diameter to accommodate the valve head and the other of which is of lesser diameter.” In other words it is conceded, as indeed it must be, that appellant’s application does not disclose “a chamber formed intermediate the ends of said bore,” as called for in the appealed count. That being so, it is obvious that appellant does not disclose a valve head “of greater diameter than said bore and less in diameter than said chamber.”</p>
    <p id="b733-5" data-blocks='[["BL_733.5",733,[81,1111,1328,645]]]'>It will be observed that the Board of Appeals stated in its decision that appellant’s disclosure did not show a chamber in the bore, as called for in the appealed count, if the language of the count be given its ordinary meaning. The board was of opinion, however, that, if given its ordinary meaning, the language of the count is confusing and ambiguous, and that it should be construed, therefore, as though it read “the bore contains a constriction which is smaller than the valve head against which the head is forced to prevent air flow and that the bore adjacent this constriction is sufficiently large so as to form a chamber or passageway through which flow may occur when the head is moved away from the constriction into it,” and held that, as thus construed, the count read upon the disclosure in appellant’s application.</p>

Since Eger’s bore 14 is of such diameter as to operatively accommodate the valve head 16, <em>his disclosure is equivalent to the immaterial limitartion of the </em>count, <em>wherein a </em>‘chamber’ <em>intermediate the ends of the tore is called for.” </em>[Italics not quoted.]</p>
