Levin, in his Official and Personal Capacities (collectively “Penn”), appeal the judgment entered in favor of Mark L. Helpin (Dr. Helpin) on his claims of breach of contract and constructive discharge after removal from his position as director of the pediatric dental clinic operated by the University at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Dr. Helpin cross-appeals, contending that the trial court erred in declining to award pre-judgment interest on the award in question, some $4,040,000.

Whereas Appellate Rule 2117(b) prohibits inclusion of argument in a party’s statement of the case, Penn’s statement, which spans the first 22 pages of its submission, is rife with contention, its characterizations of the record sharply skewed. Such tendentious statements are wholly inappropriate and do not advance a party’s case, as they offer this Court no real guidance in considering the issues.

In support of its challenge, Penn enunciates multiple arguments, which its Statement of the Question Involved suggests might support either JNOV or the award of a new trial. In its argument, however, it limits its analysis to whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the elements of Dr. Helpin’s claim for breach of contract. Because claims of evi-dentiary insufficiency do not provide grounds for award of a new trial, we restrict our analysis to whether the trial court erred in not granting JNOV in response to Penn’s arguments.</p>

Dean Raymond Fonseca, who hired Helpin and remained as Dean of Penn’s Dental School until 2003, testified that he hired Dr. Hel-pin to help revive the school’s flagging clinical programs, repair a fractured relationship with CHOP, and to re-open the CHOP Dental Clinic, which Penn had formerly operated. N.T., 6/5/07, at 53-56, 65, 66 (R.R. at A422-A434, 435, 436). Dean Fonseca testified that Dr. Helpin’s base salary, at $60,000 annually, was well below market rate and failed to provide compensation commensurate with the challenges he was asked to undertake. <em>Id. </em>at 68 (R.R. at A437). Thus, as an incentive to accept the position, the 1989 Offer Letter created a correlation between the financial performance of the clinic, Helpin’s standing as a member of the faculty at Penn, and the total compensation he would receive. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69 (R.R. at A437-438). Dean Fonseca testified further that the Dr. Helpin was to be paid “50 percent of the net operations revenue” collected by the CHOP clinic for inpatient, outpatient and hospital services. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 76 (R.R. at A439, A445) (“[The agreement] was that he had a base salary and on top of that base he would supplement that income by 50 percent of the net operations revenue that he generated at CHOP dental clinic and the CHOP hospital, inpatient and outpatient.”). Fonseca testified, in addition, that “net operations revenue” was determined by deducting the clinic’s operating expenses, including the salaries of the dentists and support staff employed there, from the clinic’s to<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>tal revenue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 70, 72-73 (R.R. at A439, A441-442). Because expenses, including salaries, changed from year to year, net operations revenue changed as well, requiring that Dr. Helpin and Dean Fonseca confer annually to agree on deductible operating expenses and, ultimately, the amount of money remaining from which the practice component of Helpin’s compensation would be paid. <em>Id. </em>at 79 (R.R. at A448); N.T., 6/7/07, at 92-93, 98 (R.R. at A-837, A838, A843).

N.T., 6/5/07, Volume II, at 97 (R.R. at A842, A843). Thus, while Helpin’s calculated salary was subject to change on an annual basis, he remained entitled to “50 percent of net operations” as explained in the 1989 Offer Letter and was free either to accept the money as additional salary or to allocate portions of it for uses at the CHOP clinic, which he sometimes did.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> N.T., 6/11/07, at 31, 32, 34 (R.R. at A944, A945, A947).

Both parties understood their agreement to be binding, recognizing that while the numbers that “50% of net operations” generated would likely change from year to year, the legal mandate from which the formula arose did not.

We find Penn’s further argument on this point less than coherent as it asserts first that Dr. Helpin was an at-will employee, <em>id. </em>at 32-33, but then acknowledges that his 1996 promotion to associate professor constituted a guarantee of continued employment from which he could be discharged only for just cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Given Dr. Helpin’s status as a tenured professor at the time of Penn’s asserted breach, subject to termination only for just cause, the failure of the Letter to define a term of duration is irrelevant and does not render Dr. Helpin an “at will” employee. <em>See Rapagnani, </em>736 A.2d at 669.</p>

The 1989 Offer Letter makes that arrangement open-ended, providing an income guarantee which, by its own terms, might be invoked only <em>after Helpin’s completion of his term as chair of his department, </em>an event that did not occur until 2003.

In point of fact, they bore no relation to it except to the extent that Helpin had to be employed at Penn to collect a salary drawn from the income of the CHOP clinic. Penn’s arguments to the contrary, that Helpin’s intervening faculty appointments superseded the Offer Letter’s income guarantee, misperceive the purpose of those appointment letters as well as the nature of the parties’ agreement. Although the subsequent appointment letters individually extended Helpin’s academic appointment during a period when it remained at-will, none of them altered his income arrangement from the CHOP clinic. Moreover, they made no mention of his status once he was no longer a department chair. Consequently, their terms are immaterial to the dispute now before us.</p>

Penn does not dispute the terms of that guarantee, nor does it assert that the Dental School ever invoked the “just cause” provisions of that arrangement to terminate Dr. Helpin. Rather, Penn argues, Dr. Helpin left of his <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>own accord and thereby relinquished any right he had to collect further salary from the CHOP clinic.

Moreover, further testimony established that after Dr.- Helpin was removed from the position of department chair, he was prohibited from seeing patients at the CHOP clinic whom he previously had treated, and was not supplied with an office, clerical staff or computer at the location to which he was transferred. Further evidence showed that he was denied reimbursement for routine expenses, accused of budgetary improprieties, and issued a disciplinary letter by the new dean. These circumstances cause us no hesitation in finding the evidence legally sufficient to sustain the constructive discharge claim. <em>Cf.

The substantial nature of Dr. Hel-pin’s continued compensation is not a basis upon which Penn can circumvent the objective standard by which a claim of constructive discharge is judged; nothing in our law or in any authority Penn cites mandates that a plaintiff prove penury as a result of the defendant’s actions to prove that he was forced to resign.

Although judges and juries are not fortune tellers equipped with crystal balls, the <em>Feldman </em>approach to determining <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>productivity as a factor in awarding future lost earning best approximates the soothsayers by presenting the triers of fact with all relevant evidence. After laying a proper foundation, expert and lay witnesses are called upon to testify as to the victim’s past and future employment possibilities. The defense may cross-examine the plaintiffs witnesses and present evidence on their own behalf. Upon a thorough evaluation of all the evidence presented, the factfinder makes an informed estimation of the victim’s lost earning capacity.</blockquote>

Trial Court Opinion, 6/30/08, at 18-19. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s determination. As the profits of the CHOP clinic paid to Dr. Helpin were substantially a function of his individual productivity and are limited to Helpin’s working life, the factors considered by our Supreme Court in <em>Kaczkowski </em>to gauge individual productivity as a measure of damages appear equally applicable here. Penn offers no authority from any jurisdiction to suggest the contrary.
