    <blockquote id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[245,457,713,675]]]'>In assessing whether work conditions are abnormal, we must recognize that the work environment is a microcosm of society. It is not a shelter from rude behavior, obscene language, incivility, or stress. While we do not suggest that insensitive behavior is socially acceptable in the work place, it is unrealistic to expect that such behavior will not occur. Where, as here, the evidence demonstrates that the offensive behavior complained of is an isolated incident, we must conclude that an abnormal working condition has not been established.</blockquote>

Even after learning that morning that the accusation was false, Employer’s maintenance manager suspended her the next morning and ultimately terminated her, accusing her this time that she left work without permission on November 23, 1995, which Employer’s own witness testified was untrue.

Moreover, we believe that the facts here indicate that [the supervisor], to shield himself from charges of insurance fraud, attempted to use Claimant as a scapegoat. Therefore, we hold that Claimant was exposed to abnormal working conditions and is entitled to benefits.</blockquote>
