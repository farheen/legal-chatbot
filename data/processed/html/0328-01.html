Appellant, New Hampshire Insurance Company (“New Hampshire”), insured the driver allegedly responsible for the accident, Thomas MacMas-ter. Appellee, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“State Farm”), insured the injured driver, Arthur Doakes. State Farm made payments to cover Mr. Doakes’ medical expenses and lost wages up to the $100,000 limits of the personal injury protection (“PIP”) coverage. State Farm then filed applications for intercompany arbitration on its claims against New Hampshire alleging that its insured, MacMaster, was responsible for the accident.</p>

AF is a nationwide administrator of arbitration agreements, including the two agreements involved in this case — the Nationwide Intercompany Arbitration Agreement, which covers claims for property damage, and the Automobile Accident Reparations Arbitration Agreement (“AARAA”), which covers PIP payments. Both claims in this case were arbitrated under the AARAA, as permitted by that agreement.</p>

Fruehauf has filed an affidavit stating that she sent AF a deferment form and cover letter on January 6, 1992. However, AF denies receiving such a request and Fruehauf is unable to produce copies of the documents.</p>

On that basis both <em>Stop &amp; Shop </em>and 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2904(b) are distinguishable. The issue here is the right of the parties to an arbitration to appeal. The right may not be conferred by inference; it must be conferred by the State Constitution or statute. <em>Sinha, </em>585 A.2d at 1313.</p>

The Act clearly does not grant appellate jurisdiction to the Superior Court. Rather, any appellate jurisdiction arising from Chapter 57 is bestowed on the Court of Chancery. Title 10, § 5714 allows the Court of Chancery to vacate an award or order a rehearing by arbitrators under certain limited circumstances. 10 <em>Del.C. § </em>5714. Similarly, the Court of Chancery is given the power to modify or correct an arbitrator’s award in some situations. 10 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 5715.</p>

This power only arises, however, upon confirmation, modification or correction of such awards by the Court of Chancery. <em>Id. </em>Such authority is necessary as the Superior Court, through the Office of the Prothonotary, maintains records of judgments. 10 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2303.</p>
