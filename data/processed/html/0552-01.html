Doe argues that the court erred in dismissing his claims that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 1999 (SOR-NA), 34-A M.R.S. §§ 11201-11256 (2006), violates his rights to procedural and substantive due process, equal protection, and a civil jury trial pursuant to the United States and Maine Constitutions.

He was sentenced to less than seventy days of incarceration. He had previously been convicted of public indecency when he was eighteen years old.</p>

He is gainfully employed and has worked almost continuously for over twenty years. He married his current wife in 1988, and she has three children from a previous marriage. His wife told him that she will have to leave him if his name goes on the sex offender registry. He also states that he has reason to believe that he will lose his job if his name is placed on the registry and his neighbors will attempt to get him to leave the neighborhood. He is in fear of violence to his person.</p>

Everett Flan-nery, in his capacity as Kennebec County Sheriff, was later added as a defendant. Doe alleges that the retroactive provisions of SORNA, 34-A M.R.S. § 11222, render the statute unconstitutional pursuant to the United States and Maine Constitutions. Specifically, Doe alleges violations of (1) procedural due process because he was not informed of the registration requirements when he entered his guilty plea; (2) procedural due process because SORNA is unconstitutionally vague; (3) substantive due process because Doe’s right to privacy is violated and the violation of his privacy right is not rationally related to. a legitimate government interest; (4) equal protection because classifying lifetime registrants differently from ten-year registrants creates an unfair clas-<a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>sifieation; and (5) the right to a jury trial because both the registry classification and the risk assessment require findings of fact that must be found by a jury.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[149,483,753,1286]]]'>[¶6] Doe filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a supporting affidavit to prohibit the defendants from arresting or prosecuting him for failing to register pursuant to SORNA, or from publishing his name while he pursued his complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In his affidavit Doe repeats many of the allegations in his complaint. Additionally, he states that he is a stepfather to his wife’s three children and a step-grandfather to seven children. He states that he has reason to believe that two men whose names were on the sex offender registry were murdered by a stranger who had searched the registry immediately before committing the murders. After reading about the murders, Doe’s terrified wife told Doe that if his name went on the registry she would have to leave him to protect her family. In his affidavit Doe also lists his other convictions consisting of forgery and several counts of negotiating a worthless instrument, all before 1989, and furnishing liquor to a minor before 1998.</p>
    <p id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[150,1796,752,397]]]'>[¶ 7] The court denied the temporary restraining order, finding that Doe failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits. Thereafter, Fowle, Poulin, and Flannery filed motions to dismiss pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Prior to the argument on the motions, Doe registered as a sex offender.</p>

With regard to Doe’s procedural due process claim that he had not been informed about SORNA when he pleaded guilty, the court treated it as an ex post facto claim and ruled that <em>State v. Haskell, </em><a href="/a2d/784/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2001 ME 154" data-case-ids="9459795" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0004-01">2001 ME 154</a>, <a href="/a2d/784/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2001 ME 154" data-case-ids="9459795" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0004-01">784 A.2d 4</a> (holding that SORNA is not an ex post facto law), controlled. Further, the court determined that because the registration requirement is a collateral consequence of conviction as a sex offender, due process protections do not come into play. Regarding Doe’s claim that SORNA is void for vagueness, the court found that SORNA is clear that the duty to register is triggered by a sex offense conviction and the type of registration clearly depends on the statutory classification of the offense. As to the substantive due process claim, the court held that because criminal convictions are already public information, adding other identifying Information does not breach any fundamental privacy right, or if it does, it is in furtherance of protecting public welfare.</p>
    <p id="b603-10" data-blocks='[["BL_603.10",603,[948,1371,757,758]]]'>[¶ 9] The court concluded that there is no equal protection violation because there is a rational relationship between the creation of two classes of offenders — ten-year and lifetime — based on the seriousness of the offense and the legislative goal of protecting the public. Concerning Doe’s claim that SORNA deprives him of his right to a jury trial, the court held that there is no fact for a jury to find because the classification of the registration, that is, a ten-year registration or a lifetime registration, is based solely on the particular statute pursuant to which the person is convicted.</p>

Thus, once every ninety days, a personal appearance at a police station is required. At that time, the police agency, in addition to verifying the registrant’s identity, takes the registrant’s fingerprints. 34-A M.R.S. § 11222(4)(D).

The recent amendments to SORNA have retroactively enhanced criminal punishments by: (1) changing a fifteen-year registration requirement to lifetime State supervision; (2) removing the opportunity for waiver of the registration requirement upon a showing of his rehabilitation or for other good cause; (3) exposing registrants to punishments similar to the shaming and ridicule penalties of colonial times by identifying and targeting them on the internet, subjecting them to the documented risk of retribution and vigilante violence; (4) requiring them to report in person to the police and be fingerprinted once every ninety days for fife; and (5) restricting their personal liberty by effectively barring them from being in certain public places.
