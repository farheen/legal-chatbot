Appellant, who is Ghaner’s widow, the adminis-tratrix of his estate, and the guardian of them children, initiated this action by filing a complaint on April 17, 1998 against Bin-di, the driver of the vehicle who hit Ghaner. After Appellee was served with the complaint and had answered it, the matter proceeded to discovery.</p>

Horne, Esquire represented Appellee. Following the pretrial conference, the trial court issued an order scheduling jury selection for October 4, 1999 and a trial to commence October 21, 1999. The order also stated that “Plaintiff[’s counsel] indicated he would speak with his client and recommend that the matter be withdrawn. Plaintiff will notify Defendant at the earliest possible date if the matter is going to be withdrawn and file the necessary papers.” (Trial Court Order, 9/16/99.)</p>

In this motion, Attorney Manchester stated that he had advised Appellant to discontinue this action because deposition testimony had revealed that Appellant’s decedent was not in the cross walk and had crossed against the signal when the accident occurred.</p>

During the argument, Attorney Manchester explained that Appellant had expressed a desire to seek a second opinion from her family attorney, David Todd,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> who had referred the present case to Attorney Manchester. Attorney Manchester further explained that both he and Attorney Todd had experienced difficulties in communicating quickly with Appellant due to her significant hearing loss and resultant inability to communicate by telephone.</p>

Finally, Attorney Manchester explained that his wife recently had taken ill and was scheduled to undergo surgery in Pittsburgh the next morning.</p>

By order dated the following day, the trial court denied Attorney Manchester’s petition for leave to withdraw as counsel and the request for a continuance.

On October 5, <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>1999, the trial court granted Appellee’s motion for summary judgment, without oral argument.

(Appellant’s Brief, at 3.)</p>

In the present case the record reveals only a single failure to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure, during a time when the trial court was aware of a dispute between Appellant and her counsel that her counsel was attempting to resolve. Appellant was given no opportunity to correct this omission. There is simply no evidence of record of any bad faith or a pattern of repeated willful, dilatory or obdurate conduct on the part of Appellant or her counsel. There is similarly no evidence of repeated failure to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure or other orders of the trial court. Moreover, Appellee’s counsel admitted at oral argument that he was aware of the identity of the potential fact witnesses. (N.T. Motion in Limine and Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, 9/30/99, at 5, 28.) Thus, any prejudice to Appellee is in his immediate trial preparation and is curable upon remand.</p>
