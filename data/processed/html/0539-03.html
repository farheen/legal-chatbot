On October 9, 1992, Officer Jerome J. Cartmell of the Tredyffrin Township Police Department observed appellee’s vehicle proceed at a speed in excess of the posted speed limit. Upon stopping the vehicle the officer noticed that appellee exhibited signs of intoxication, his speech was slurred, his eyes were glassy, he smelled of alcohol, and he swayed when he walked. Officer Cartmell asked appellee to perform field sobriety tests. Appellee was unable to perform the tests. Officer Cart-mell then placed appellee under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa.S.C. § 3731.</p>

Your continued request to speak to a lawyer or anyone else after this explanation is given, or your silence when asked to submit to a chemical test, will be considered as a refusal of the chemical test subjecting you to the suspension of your driv<a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>ing privilege.

Officer Cartmell then told appel-lee that because this was a drunk driving case he was not entitled to consult with an attorney at that time. Appellee continued to refuse to submit to the blood test until he was first afforded the opportunity to speak with counsel. Officer Cartmell then transported appellee to the Tredyffin Township Police Station. At the police station appellee was again read the above cited warnings. Appellee again refused to submit to chemical testing without first consulting his attorney. Another officer, Officer Marc A. Reider, explained the <em>O’Connell </em>warnings once again to appellee, reiterating that he was not entitled to speak to counsel before the blood test. Appellee continued to refuse and to demand that he see his attorney. At that point a refusal was noted.</p>

Appellee appealed the suspension to the Court of Common Pleas. The trial court rescinded the suspension finding that because appellee believed he was entitled to consult with an attorney, he did not knowingly or consciously refuse to submit to the blood test. The trial court reasoned that although appellee was properly provided with <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, when Officer Cartmell then told appellee that “because this is a drunk driving case you do not have the right to counsel,” that misstatement of law increased appellee’s confusion, thus, vitiating the properly given <em>O’Connell </em>warnings.</p>

The Commonwealth Court affirmed, agreeing with the trial court that appellee’s confusion was justified following Officer Cartmell’s misstatement regarding appellee’s right to counsel. Allowance of appeal was granted to review whether, as a matter of law, a fact finder is free to find that a refusal is not knowing where the police officer has adequately complied with his duty under <em>O’Connell.</em>

The trial court ignored the fact that proper <em>O’Connell </em>warnings were given to appellee two more times following this one misstatement by Officer Cartmell. To find that Officer Cartmell’s misstatement, sandwiched in between three properly worded <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, would have the devastating effect of nullifying all the correct statements of law provided to appellee, is a conclusion unjustified on the basis of this record.

    </p>
    <p id="b599-16" data-blocks='[["BL_599.19",599,[1003,626,754,1042]]]'>The trial court compounded its error by then going on to conclude that DOT failed to prove that appellee made a knowing and conscious refusal to submit to chemical testing. However, it was appellee’s burden, not DOT’S burden, to establish that he was <em>“not capable, </em>of making a knowing and conscious refusal to take the test.” <em>O’Connell, supra. </em>[emphasis supplied]. In essence, the trial court determined that although the officers had advised appellee of his <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, as appellee refused to believe the officers, his subsequent refusal to submit to chemical testing was not a knowing and conscious refusal. A motorist’s subjective beliefs are an insufficient justification for refusing to comply with the mandates of the Implied Consent Law. Refusing to believe the substance of the <em>O’Connell </em>warnings as given does not render the motorist <em>incapable </em>of making a knowing and conscious decision regarding chemical testing.</p>
    <p id="b599-17" data-blocks='[["BL_599.20",599,[1001,1690,757,889]]]'>As this court recognized in <em>O’Connell, </em>a motorist is incapable of making a knowing and conscious refusal when he is unaware that his right to remain silent and his right to consult with an attorney are not applicable to the provisions of the Implied Consent Law. <em>O’Connell, </em>521 Pa. at 252, 555 A2d at 877. Plainly stated, in the type of situations where this issue arises, we have a police officer dealing with a motorist who is suspected of being inebriated to the point that his ability to drive safely is being questioned. Obviously, when a motorist manifests intoxication to such a degree that an officer reasonably believes it is necessary to place the motorist under arrest and ask that the motorist submit to a chemical sobriety test, it is reasonable to assume that the motorist may be somewhat confused.</p>

Driving in Pennsylvania is a civil privilege conferred on state residents who meet the necessary qualifications. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1501. Under the terms of the Implied Consent Law, one of the necessary qualifications to continuing to hold that privilege is that a motorist must submit to chemical sobriety testing when requested to do so, in accordance with the prerequisites of the Implied Consent Law, by an authorized law enforcement officer. The obligation to submit to testing is related specifically to the motorist’s continued enjoyment of the privilege of maintaining his operator’s license. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(b).</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[194,1029,759,1051]]]'>The problem for most motorists is that the chemical sobriety test has the potential of revealing evidence that links the motorist to criminal wrongdoing, driving while under the influence (DUI). <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 8731. Once the motorist has been placed under arrest, the arresting officer normally provides <em>Miranda </em>warnings relevant to the criminal offense of DUI. So, armed with this knowledge of his rights, the motorist may reasonably assume he has the right to consult with an attorney before the chemical testing, or to refuse to submit to the testing as an exercise of his right to remain silent. The fact that the sanctions imposed by the Implied Consent Law are wholly separate and unrelated to the consequences of a criminal DUI prosecution is a nuance of the law that can readily escape the average motorist, let alone one suspected of being inebriated to the degree which prompted the officer to request that he submit to the test.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[192,2120,756,617]]]'>Thus, the motorist faces the dilemma of submitting to the test and thereby “proving” that he is in fact driving under the influence, or refusing the test and facing the absolute penalty of losing his driver’s license for one year while still facing criminal prosecution. Reason and justice dictate that the motorist should be advised before making his decision that the loss of his driving privileges is a matter controlled completely by the Implied Consent Law and that his <em>Miranda </em>rights are not applicable to the decision to submit to chemical sobriety testing.</p>

Thus, we now hold, whenever a motorist has been requested to submit to <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>chemical sobriety testing the motorist must be provided <em>O’Connell </em>warnings regardless of whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given, and, regardless of whether the motorist exhibits confusion concerning his rights when asked to submit to chemical sobriety testing.</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[198,511,761,1266]]]'>Once an officer provides <em>O’Connell </em>warnings to a motorist, the officer has done all that is legally required to ensure that the motorist has been fully advised of the consequences of refusing to submit to chemical testing. By requiring the officer to advise the motorist that his <em>Miranda </em>rights are not applicable to the request to submit to chemical sobriety testing, the officer can be assured that he has done everything possible to assist the motorist in making an informed decision consistent with that motorist’s rights as articulated by the Constitution and by the Implied Consent Law. Placing this additional burden on law enforcement in order to attempt to insure that a motorist is making a knowledgeable and informed decision is certainly reasonable and justified given the potential for confusion in circumstances such as these. Furthermore, the additional burden of requiring <em>O’Connell </em>Warnings, whenever an officer requests a motorist to submit to chemical testing, is minor when balanced against the obvious need to verify that the motorist is fully aware of his rights and responsibilities when being asked to submit to the testing.</p>

Appellee just “didn’t believe it.” After an officer has fully and thoroughly complied with his obligations in accordance with <em>O’Connell, </em>the motorist may not validly continue to refuse chemical testing by claiming that he did not believe the <em>O’Connell </em>warnings.
