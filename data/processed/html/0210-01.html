Two of them were charges of taking indecent liberties with the sexual parts of two of his granddaughters aged ten and eight; the third was a charge of sodomy involving his nine year old grandson. The offenses were alleged to have occurred on or about August 2, 1966. The three charges were <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>tried together at the May Term, 1967, and the jury found him guilty of each charge. The three convictions are before us on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[156,498,751,1481]]]'>The State presented as witnesses the three children and their mother, the daughter-in-law of the defendant. The age of the defendant was stipulated to be 57 at the time of trial. The testimony revealed that the two families lived in small houses some one hundred feet apart in a rural area. There were five children in the family of the younger Fischers and the mother and father were both employed away from the home at the beginning of the period we are considering. The defendant was unemployed and was taking daytime care of Raymond, aged 12, and Dale, both sons of other children of the defendant, while his wife was working away from the home. Some of the criminal acts complained of were described as taking place in the defendant’s house while the children were visiting him during the daytime. Some were said to have occurred in the children’s home while their parents were away. Each child described the acts concerning that child and each girl testified that she witnessed the events involving the other. The boy described observing one of the acts which the State charges took place with the younger girl. The mother testified to complaints which were made to her by each of the children concerning the grandfather’s actions.</p>

Raymond said that none of these criminal acts had occurred in his presence, which disputed the assertions of the other children. The defendant’s wife testified that no complaints had been made to her until December 5th when the younger Mrs. Fischer took the children to the sheriff which resulted in the defendant’s arrest. She agreed that her daughter-in-law had told her that the children were not to visit the defendant’s house as long ago as March of 1966 but ascribed this to an increasing estrangement which had developed in the family soon after the elder Fischers had moved into the neighborhood.</p>

    <p id="b243-10" data-blocks='[["BL_243.11",243,[956,891,754,1049]]]'>Before testimony was heard from the three complaining children the justice conducted a lengthy examination of each child to ascertain that child’s competence to testify. The justice was thorough, patient and resourceful in testing the understanding of each child. This questioning disclosed that this nine-year-old boy, although still in the first grade in school, was able to give intelligent answers to the justice’s questions concerning his home, family and school and his personal out of school activities. He demonstrated an understanding of the distinction between truth and falsehood and the significance of the oath. He showed ability to comprehend the questions asked him and to give responsive answers. Although his status in school indicated a mentally retarded condition, the record of this preliminary examination supports the justice’s decision that the child was competent to testify.</p>
    <blockquote id="b243-11" data-blocks='[["BL_243.12",243,[994,1976,717,756]],["BL_244.1",244,[223,268,714,279]]]'>“The question of the competency of a child to testify is addressed largely to the discretion of the presiding Justice, but it is <em>judicial </em>discretion. It must not be an arbitrary decision. It must be based not only on the appearance of the child, but it also must be based on what answers the child makes to show that he, or she is, qualified to testify. The proposed child witness should know the difference between truth and falsehood, and apparently must be able to receive accurate impressions of facts, and be able to relate truly the impressions received. The child witness should have sufficient capacity to un<a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>derstand, in some measure, the obligation of an oath; or to realize that it is wrong to falsify, and that if he does tell an untruth that he is likely to be punished.” State of Maine v.

    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[182,582,751,422]]]'>This test was met. The preliminary determination by the justice that the child had sufficient capabilities to understand and appreciate all the obligations of an oath to qualify him to testify was not an abuse of discretion. Under our practice the responsibility for evaluating the weight to be given to the child’s testimony then became the jury’s.</p>

    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.7",244,[172,1166,758,996]]]'>The thrust of the defendant’s argument here relates to a certain contradiction in the testimony of the children. It is imperative that this testimony should be examined with the greatest of care because of the very nature of the offense charged. We have many times before recognized the ease with which an untruthful child can bring a wholly baseless charge against a man and the enormous difficulties of defending against such a charge. State v. Newcomb, <a href="/me/146/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="146 Me. 173" data-case-ids="663192" data-case-paths="/me/146/0173-01">146 Me. 173</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20A.2d%20787" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="78 A.2d 787">78 A.2d 787</a> (1951). It is self-evident, too, that such offenses are seldom committed in the presence of adult witnesses and that the necessity of enforcing the law to protect children frequently requires reliance on the testimony of a child uncorroborated or with little corroboration. In such cases, however, the testimony of the child must be scrutinized with great care.</p>
    <p id="b244-7" data-blocks='[["BL_244.8",244,[169,2208,756,518]],["BL_244.9",244,[984,271,753,613]]]'>We have examined the children’s accounts of these incidents carefully. The testimony of the two girls was not entirely free from discrepancies. After they had complained to their mother concerning the defendant’s conduct an encounter resulted between the girls and their grandmother, Ruth, in which they had insisted to Ruth that her husband, the defendant, had molested them. The grandmother had said she did not believe their accusation and during the doubtless stormy conversation the children had made statements about the conduct of another member of the family, the significance of which statements is not entirely clear. The older girl’s testimony on cross-examination as to this leaves us uncertain as to whether she means that she told Ruth that L— had also been molesting her but that it was a lie or that she was insisting to Ruth that any accusation that L— had molested her was a lie. Her testimony was that L— had not molested her and her own words on this issue were enigmatical.</p>

The significance of the language used by the children in describing an embarrassing discussion with an hostile adult, which Mrs. Fischer doubtless was, was one of the elements which the jury was required to determine in evaluating all the testimony in the case. We cannot say that as a matter of law the words used by the older girl in repeating this discussion made her testimony so unreliable as to taint the jury verdict or that there was any such discrepancy as would result in an absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The accounts given by these children were by no means incredible. We find none of the fatal inconsistencies, contradictions or improbabilities which impelled us to hold that the State had failed in its burden of proof in State v.

In making this evaluation the jury had the advantage of testing the boy’s story itself.

Their mother testified that all three children had made complaints to her about the defendant’s sexual acts but apparently not until they had continued for many weeks, and that she herself had once seen the defendant “trying to get fresh” with the older girl. Although she had some reason to believe the defendant’s conduct toward her children was improper as early April she made no complaint to law enforcement officers until December 5th. In April she had complained to Ruth about Ruth’s husband’s conduct and was told her own “past” would be exposed if she said any more. Until December she had tried to keep her children away from the defendant’s house while at the same time not refusing to entertain defendant and his wife when they called at her own home. Her testi<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>mony reveals the situation of a worried and harrassed woman, concerned with her children’s safety but hesitant to destroy the relationship of the two families, and inadequate to cope with the circumstances surrounding her. Any delay in bringing charges such as these to the attention of the police causes grave concern to the courts, but such delays are by no means unusual. We know that children often through fear, shame or confusion do not complain of such offenses against them for considerable periods of time. The record makes the reluctance of this somewhat inarticulate woman to commence criminal action against her husband’s father who lives one hundred feet away understandable although no commendable. Her reluctance vanished in December when she found she had reason to fear for her three year old daughter also. The significance of her comportment was for the jury.</p>

In my view no dispassionate jury, unless unduly influenced by the disgusting nature of the acts charged and the youthfulness of the complainants, could fail to entertain very real and serious doubts as to the truthfulness of the accusations. My brother Dufresne has carefully examined the manifest and fatal weaknesses in the evidence relied upon by the State in Case #1134. I find in the cases involving the two female complainants a welter of confusion and contradiction which will not suffice to satisfy the State’s burden of proof. No useful purpose will be served by enumerating here the instances in which these children contradicted themselves and each other. Doubts which will not be swept away are engendered by the fact that these youthful witnesses had made accusations against two other men, accusation identical to those now made against the respondent, accusations which they now assert were false. The evidence, of course, is of such a nature as to stimulate conjecture and arouse grave suspicion as to the possible guilt of the respondent. But mere conjecture, however accurate, and deep suspicion, however justified, will not alone suffice under our system of law to overcome the presumption of innocence vouchsafed to a respondent in every criminal case. As a matter of law the quality of proof must rise to a higher level than is present here.</p>
