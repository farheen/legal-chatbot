In the criminal proceeding, pursuant to a first offender statute, Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, § 18.2-251, the Virginia court first delayed imposition of sentence for one year, then dismissed the case one year later pursuant to the first offender statute. Although reinstated to the Virginia Bar, respondent was subsequently disciplined by the bar of Virginia “pursuant to a disciplinary rule that provides that illegal conduct that adversely reflects on a respondent’s fitness to practice law is grounds for discipline.” <em>In re Gardner, </em><a href="/a2d/625/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="625 A.2d 293" data-case-ids="7351564" data-case-paths="/a2d/625/0293-01">625 A.2d 293</a>, 294 (D.C.1993) <em>(Gardner </em>I).

Indeed, in this case, the Virginia Disciplinary Board, which had suspended respondent as a result of the initial finding of guilt before dismissal, applying its own interpretation of the effect of Virginia’s first offender statute in the disciplinary case, restored respondent’s license to practice law upon proof of the dismissal of the charges and instituted proceedings on the underlying facts which led to the criminal charge.

Bar Counsel noted the report of respondent’s successful recovery from his drug addiction and that there were no grounds upon which to challenge his present ability to practice law. Bar Counsel also expressed the opinion that although respondent was obligated to report the finding of guilt, discipline was not appropriate because appellant’s conviction never became final under the law of Virginia. The Board took the position that the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to justify initiating a petition rests with Bar Counsel with respect to respondent’s failure to report the finding of guilt or the impact of respondent’s drug use on his ability to practice. <em>See </em>D.C.Bar R. XI, § 8(b) (at the conclusion of an investigation, "Bar Counsel may, with prior approval of a Contact Member, dismiss the complaint, informally admonish the attorney ..., or institute formal charges”). The Board saw no reason to second guess Bar Counsel in this regard, and proceeded to address the issue of reciprocal discipline. On the particular facts before us, we perceive no basis to question the propriety of the Board's recommendation in this regard.</p>
