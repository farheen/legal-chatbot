The broader of those claims, 1, 2, and 13, were rejected by the examiner on Bradford alone. The specification of the patent was reviewed at some length, attention being directed to its teaching that the porosity of the cast iron used had the effect of causing an accumulation of water in the cells of the metal which prevented the butter granules from sticking to the walls. He held that the only feature of claims 1, 2, and 13 not disclosed in the Bradford patent is “the use of a metal in the casting which does not affect the flavor of butter,” and, in effect, held the phrase of the claims, “incapable, under normal conditions, of affecting the flavor of butter” to be a mere functional statement. He applied the same reasoning to claims 20 and 21 which he rejected on Bradford alone, and also “on Bradford in view of the Danish patent.” The holding was, in effect, that there would be no invention in substituting aluminum or tin in place of the cast iron of <a id="p1061" href="#p1061" data-label="1061" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1061</a>Bradford, if desired, and “it particularly would not amount to invention to do tliis in view of tlie Danish patent.”</p>

It may well be that the Bradford cast iron device is perfectly fitted to serve in the churning operation but wholly unsuited for the working operation which requires the use of' salt: Indeed, one of the metals listed among appellants’ experiments as being tried is cast iron, and it is recited that butter, when that metal was used in the working, was given a metallic taste and that the metal was tarnished.

No particular kinds of aluminum and tin are specified,, and, like the Bradford patent, the Danish patent has no teaching of a double use of the cask.

Appellants subsequently (their application at issue was-, filed July 23, 1934,) by a series of experiments demonstrated that cast aluminum and cast tin could be used successfully. Affidavits of disinterested parties were introduced into the record showing that the butter producing industry had sought an improvement over the churns and butter working devices being used (there is no showing of any actual use of any metal devices prior to that of appellants), and that appellants’ apparatus met this desire.
