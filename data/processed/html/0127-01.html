Auditors further requested that their salaries and benefits continue during the extension period. County filed an answer denying that Auditors are unable to timely complete their work or that any salary or benefits should be paid during any extension period. In new matter, County averred that it believes Auditors already reviewed all relevant records. Furthermore, they had at least two months from the date the County books were closed to complete their audit and file a report.

According to Ms. Strub, Auditors review each account’s receipts and make sure the transaction sheet is balanced. Testimony was given that the total budget in Pike County for 2003 was $24,000,000.00, for 2007 it was $33,000,000.00, and for 2008 it was $34,000,000.00. Since she has been an auditor, Ms. Strub indicated the volume of work has increased and more time must be spent doing the audit. When asked to quantify the increase in work, Ms. Strub <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>stated the work increased “a lot.” R.R. at 24a. When asked on cross-examination what exactly has increased from 2008 to 2009 that prevents a timely completion of the audit, she responded “I can’t say.” R.R. at 49a. Ms. Strub did specify, however, that more checks were being written by the County necessitating more time reviewing cash disbursements from the general fund. Per Ms. Strub, the first four years she acted as an auditor, the audit was not completed until December 31st of each year. An audit for fiscal year 2007 was completed by October 31, 2008.</p>

This represented about a thirty percent reduction in the budget allocated to Auditors from the previous year. According to Ms. Stuart, as of the June 2009 hearing, Auditors were close to exceeding their budget. She stated that on May 18, 2007, Auditors had spent 296 total days working on the audit for fiscal year 2006. At that same point in 2008, they had spent 334 days on the audit for fiscal year 2007. As of May 29, 2009, Auditors had worked a cumulative 341 days on the fiscal year 2008 audit. According to Ms. Stuart, Auditors are behind the pace they worked at last year in terms of work completed.

The trial court found Auditors presented “good cause” for an extension of time to complete the audit. Dec. dated 6/26/09, p. 7. The trial court relied on the fact that since 2003, there has been approximately a 40% increase in expenditures for Pike County. It theorized that inflation could not account for all of this increase, thereby clearly establishing an increased workload. The trial court further examined the increase in hours worked by Auditors in recent years through May and concluded that the increase in hours corresponded closely to an increase in expenditures over that same period.</p>

It added, however, that no evidence was submitted justifying an extension beyond October 31, 2009 as the materials to review for fiscal year 2008 appeared similar to those of fiscal year 2007.</p>

It contends that Auditors have made it common practice to work on the audit and upon approaching the statutory deadline for completion of the same, to file a request for, and receive, an extension to complete the task. County suggests that Auditors have not attempted, nor come close, to completing the audits by the statutory deadline. Rather, it suggests Auditors have come to expect an extension of time to complete their audit in addition to an extension of <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>the salary and benefits that comes with it.

The amendment of Sections 703 and 1721 of the County Code changed the “due date” for these items until July 1st of each year. The remaining language of these provisions was left intact. Consistent with Section 1953 of the Rules of Statutory Construction, we are to consider the contents of Sections 703 and 1721 of the County Code as if they were always written to indicate that an audit should be completed and a report generated by July 1st of each year. Further, we are to consider the statute to have always stated that despite this deadline, a county’s auditors have the opportunity to petition for an extension of time to complete their tasks.

The record shows, however, that Auditors were not capable of completing audits by July 1st for the past several years. County never challenged the Auditors request to an extension until the previous year’s audit and the request for an extension was granted in that instance. Therefore, simply because Ms. Strub was unable to give specifics as to why the audit for fiscal year 2008 was any more difficult than previous audits does not preclude an extension as the Auditors received previously.</p>

Moreover, when Ms. Strub testified on June 16, 2009, just two weeks before the July 1st deadline, she went over a document that showed that there was plenty of work to be done and Ms. Strub’s own words emphasized that fact. Thus, it appears the trial court had little choice but to grant Auditors an extension thereby precluding a finding of a manifestly unreasonable exercise in judgment. We note that the task given Auditors is not a small one as their final report shall show “distinctly and separately <em>all receipts and expenditures </em>of the several offices, and <em>all debts and accounts due, </em>and the amount raised from <em>each source of revenue, </em>and <em>the expenditures in detail </em>...” (Emphasis added). 16 P.S. § 1721(a).

County posits that some accounts scheduled to be included in the fiscal year 2008 audit are/were not required to be audited including the Industrial Commercial Dump Authority (ICDA), the county library, and the Economic Development Association (EDA). Instead, it contends Auditors can only audit these accounts, if necessary, by filing a petition and obtaining court approval to audit these accounts. In support of this argument, County relies on a 1981 decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County, <em>Besecker v. Pleasant Valley Manor, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-d-c3d/18/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="18 Pa.

In that case, county auditors sought to audit the records of Pleasant Valley Manor, Inc. (Pleasant Valley), a non-profit corporation duly incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania. Pleasant Valley refused to make available its financial records. As a result of this refusal, the county auditors deemed it necessary to file a petition to review Pleasant Valley's records. The <em>Besecker </em>Court reviewed the text of Section 1721(a) of the County Code that, with the exception of the statutory date to complete the audit, remains intact today. Particular attention was paid to the phrase "[t]he auditors shall audit, settle and adjust <em>the accounts of all county officers of the county.” </em>It noted that Monroe County appropriated substantial sums of money to the operation of Pleasant Valley. It added that county commissioners sat on the board of trustees for Pleasant Valley and fill other vacancies on the board by appointment. The <em>Besecker </em>Court found that the county auditors had the power to audit Pleasant Valley. It concluded that in order to properly audit the accounts of all county officers and to detail the financial condition of the county, the county auditors must be permitted to review Pleasant Valley's financial records.</p>

        <em>Besecker </em>does not require a petition to audit certain non-profit or private entities that receive county appropriations. A petition was filed in that case only after the targeted organization refused to turn over financial records. It does not appear that the ICDA, the county library, or the EDA have refused to comply or intended to refuse to comply with Auditors’ request to review their financial documents. Although the <em>Besecker </em>Court declined to adopt a policy that all non-profit or private organizations in a county need be audited, it stated that it would review each situation on a case-by-case basis. This matter did not commence with a challenge to a request for financial documents of the ICDA, county library, or EDA. Rather, it began with a request for an extension of time to complete the entire fiscal year 2008 audit. As of June 16, 2009, many accounts remained left to be audited, not just these accounts. <em>Besecker </em>does not render the trial court's extension erroneous.</p>
