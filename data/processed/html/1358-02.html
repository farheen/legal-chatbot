In this case the plaintiffs have appealed from an order of the Superior Court granting the state’s motion to dismiss an action for the assessment of damages following condemnation of plaintiffs’ property under the provisions of G.L.1956 (1990 Reenactment) chapter 6 of title 37.</p>

The trial justice had before her two contradictory affidavits regarding the issue of notice.
