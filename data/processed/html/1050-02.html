The New Yorkers went to a university dormitory looking for girls, whereupon a fight ensued between the New Yorkers and Lincoln students. The visitors were taken into custody by Lincoln campus police officers. A group of fifty to one hundred Lincoln students gathered and stormed the campus security office where the New Yorkers were being held, and more violence erupted.</p>

According to appellant, the superior court imposed adverse inferences on him rather than giving him the benefit of all inferences which could be drawn at the preliminary objection stage of the proceedings. Appellant asserts that the superior court avoided the fair inference that in addition to labeling him a racist, the article accused him of carrying out his official duties as the district attorney in a racist manner. Additionally, appellant claims that the superior court erred in concluding that there are no circumstances under which appellee’s statement could be considered defamatory. It is appellant’s position that the statement is defamatory because its effect is to “accuse MacElree of abusing his office, violating his sworn oath, and committing state and federal offenses.” Brief for appellant at 13. According to appellant, the article portrays him as “abusing his prosecutorial office by harassing a black college in order to ingratiate himself with the white voters in Chester County.” <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>

Additionally, it is his position that the claim that a statement is merely an opinion will not protect a defendant from liability for defamation. Appellant’s argument is that because the statement attacked his actions as a public official, rather than being a metaphor as found by the superior court, the accusation can be verified as true or false and therefore is capable of being defamatory. Accordingly, appellant argues that the preliminary objections should have been denied.</p>

They contend that appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing a claim of defamation. It is appellees position that it is not enough to allege that the publication is capable of any defamatory meaning. Rather, the court must be able to find that the defamatory meaning asserted by the complainant can be construed from the allegedly defamatory language.</p>
    <p id="b1117-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1117.8",1117,[1035,578,754,992]]]'>Appellees assert that the lower courts correctly held that the statement in question does not amount to actionable defamation. According to appellees, the language at issue amounted to nothing more than name calling and a charge of racism using hyperbole. It is their position that appellant’s claim relies on unsupported innuendo to state a cause of action for defamation. Appellees argue that the average reader would not interpret the language in appellees’ article to mean what appellant claims. Moreover, appellees argue, appellant takes the statement out of context with the remainder of the article in order to support his interpretation thereof. Appel-lees also argue that even if the statement were improperly attributed to Glanton, it would not support a defamation action unless it were capable of causing reputational harm.

In other words, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the statement published by the Appellees amounted to a mere allegation of racism which would not be actionable. This decision is consonant with the standard <a id="p1056" href="#p1056" data-label="1056" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1056</a>of review at this juncture in the case. Appel-lees made preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer which the trial court granted. The standard of review for preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is limited; “the question presented by the demurrer is whether, on the facts averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is possible. Where a doubt exists as to whether a demurrer should be sustained, this doubt should be resolved in favor of overruling it.” <em>AM/PM Franchise v. Atlantic Richfield, </em><a href="/pa/526/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="526 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1825873" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0110-01">526 Pa. 110</a>, 121, <a href="/pa/526/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="526 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1825873" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0110-01">584 A.2d 915</a>, 921 (1990) (citations omitted). Because, at this stage of the proceedings, it cannot be said with certainty that the statement published by the Appellees amounted to a mere allegation of racism, the preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer should have been overruled. Indeed, because there is doubt as to the statement’s precise import, and as to whether reasonable minds could understand the statement to constitute a charge of abuse of public office, <em>i.e., </em>that the District Attorney was persecuting Lincoln in order to curry favor with the voters by playing to the voters’ supposed prejudice so as to advance his own political career, the demurrer should have been denied.

Additionally, I would note that the Court’s holding today does not preclude the factfinder from ultimately concluding that as a matter of fact, the statement amounted to a mere allegation of racism, and therefore Appellant would not be entitled to recovery. Again, this is so because we are reviewing preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and as such, we are addressing a question of law, not of fact.</p>
