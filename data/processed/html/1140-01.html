Both appellants argue for reversal on the grounds that the trial court erred in admitting prejudicial evidence consisting of: (1) testimony and argument concerning throat-slashing gestures two spectators made during the testimony of a key witness for the government; (2) improper argument by the prosecutor that a government witness’ inability to identify appellants was the result of threats and intimidation that occurred in the courtroom; and (3) irrelevant testimony of a witness that encouraged the jury to speculate that appellants had a drug or gang-related motive for the killing and that unfairly tarnished the character of a key defense witness. Alternatively, if a new trial is not ordered, appellants request remand for an evidentiary hearing to address the government’s refusal to produce timely impeachment material in compliance with <em>Giglio v.

    <p id="b1175-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1175.6",1175,[91,1111,755,908]]]'>Clarence Settle testified that on May 24, 1997, while he was on his front porch in Southeast Washington talking with his cousin, Anthony Tate, he heard what sounded like a firecracker. He then saw a man, who was approximately 5'5" tall, weighing about 135 pounds, step from behind a wall and fire a weapon that appeared to be a rifle. Settle said that he then heard what sounded like an automatic weapon firing. Afterwards, Settle, who was hit by bullets in the ankle and thigh, went to check on Tate and found him lying on the front porch suffering head wounds from which he later died. The government’s theory was that Tate was the unintended victim of the intended shooting of Gregory Epps by appellants.</p>

Gregory Bean testified that he was barbecuing in his backyard when he saw two men in the alley. After the men left the alley, Rogers heard automatic weapon gunfire and “a couple of blasts” and saw two people run down the alley into a nearby building. Rogers testified that he could not identify the two men, but they were less than 5'10" tall. He had been drinking also.</p>
    <p id="b1175-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1175.11",1175,[892,595,754,1217]]]'>Bernard Pinckney testified that Ebron and Goode were at his apartment when they planned to shoot Gregory Epps and that Stanley Richardson was there also. According to Pinckney, a woman named Carolyn came to the door and asked for Ebron, and Ebron went outside with her. Ebron returned a few minutes later and told Pinckney and Goode, “He [is] out there, let’s go.” Ebron and Goode then left the apartment, but returned about ten minutes later wearing jackets (one a coat, and the other, a sweathood). Pinkney testified that Goode had an AK-47 rifle, and Ebron had what looked like a .32 caliber automatic pistol. He testified that “Little Greg” Epps was the target of the shooting and that Ebron and Goode were the shooters. Pinckney admitted that he had obtained from Rose Brown or her sister a key to the gate behind his building through which the shooters passed before shooting Tate and Settle, but he denied that he opened the gate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

She said that they were carrying a gym bag that was about two and one-half feet long with two handles and a strap. Ms. Brown denied opening the gate for Pinckney. She recounted that the year before, Goode and Ebron came up to her and others and asked if they had seen Little Greg out there, and she responded, “Yeah, maybe, I don’t know,” but explained that she could not remember exactly what she said. She testified that <a id="p1146" href="#p1146" data-label="1146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1146</a>Goode and Ebron then said they were going to kill Epps.</p>

    <p id="b1176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1176.6",1176,[194,886,756,1500]]]'>Appellants argue that the trial court erred in allowing the admission of prejudicial and inflammatory evidence. Specifically, they refer to testimony elicited by the prosecutor from the witness Pinckney concerning throat-slashing gestures that two spectators allegedly made while he was testifying. Appellants contend that the requisite foundation for admission of this evidence was not laid, as there was no showing that the gestures were made by appellants or with their knowledge or authorization. They contend that this evidence and the related argument by the prosecutor jeopardized the fairness of the trial and had a substantial impact on its outcome. The government responds that the evidence was properly admitted. Further, it contends that appellant Goode did not assert in the trial court that the basis for his objection was an insufficient showing of a connection between him and the spectators or make a claim of unique prejudice, and therefore that a plain error standard applies. We outline first the context in which the testimony occurred and whether the plain error standard applies, before turning to an analysis of the arguments in light of the applicable legal principles.</p>

Counsel for Ebron objected, and the court stated that it understood the objection. The court then expressed concern about whether that type of gesture might be intimidating to the jurors and acknowledged that whether the evidence was more prejudicial than probative was an issue. Goode’s counsel objected, explaining that the gesture “doesn’t necessarily mean that it was because of Mr. Ebron and Mr. Goode.” Counsel for Ebron added that neither he nor his intern had seen the spectator’s conduct and that such gestures could be misinterpreted. The court responded that defense counsel could call a witness in the defense case.</p>
    <p id="b1176-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1176.10",1176,[997,1320,752,918]]]'>When Pinckney resumed his testimony before the jury, the prosecutor elicited that Pinckney recognized a person in the gallery who had made a throat-slashing gesture while he was testifying. Pinckney demonstrated the throat-slashing gesture by moving his finger across his neck. The prosecutor asked Pinckney whether he had ever seen the person with either Ebron or Goode, and Pinckney responded that he had. The prosecutor then asked Pinckney how often, and his response was, “he usually be out there every day. I go walk to the store, see him down there, down there hustling, you know.” The trial court sustained appellant Ebron’s objection and ordered the “hustling” remark to be- stricken from the record.</p>

Ms. Harris testified that during Pinckney’s testimony, two young men tried to get her attention, moved to a seat behind her, tapped her on the shoulder and asked for her telephone number. She <a id="p1147" href="#p1147" data-label="1147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1147</a>said that the men returned to their seats, but continued to stare at her.</p>

He testified that he was seated behind Pinck-ney during his testimony and that he saw Ebron cock his head and point back toward the audience, make visual contact with two spectators and rub his chin down towards his throat. He testified that this happened three or four times and that each time, the two spectators would move across the courtroom into Pinckney’s sight line and make throat-slashing gestures. In cross-examination, Goode’s counsel asked the witness if he had seen Goode interact with the spectator, and the witness responded that he had not.</p>

In making the objection, Goode’s counsel argued that the fact that gestures might have been made “doesn’t necessarily mean that it was because of Mr. Ebron and Mr. Goode.” This statement was sufficient to alert the court that the basis for the objection was that there was no showing that appellants had authorized or set this intimidating conduct in motion. It adequately informed the court that the basis for the objection was the failure to show that appellants were responsible for or connected to the spectators’ conduct. As such, it was sufficient to apprise the trial court, as required, of the issues on which it was being asked to rule. <em>See Tindle v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/778/1077-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="778 A.2d 1077" data-case-ids="9497668" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/1077-01">778 A.2d 1077</a>, 1082 (D.C.2001); <em>Brown v.

After Goode’s counsel specified this basis for objecting, there was no need for Ebron’s counsel to restate the foundational challenge. He started his statement of reasons with the word “also,” as if advancing an additional ground, not simply a separate one.

Therefore, proof of the government’s case depended essentially upon the credibility of two witnesses, Bernard Pinckney and Rose Brown. Both of these witnesses were impeached with prior inconsistent statements and motives for not telling the truth. Indeed, there was evidence that Pinckney was involved in the events related to the crimes and was initially a suspect. The evidence showed that Pinckney obtained the key from Brown and opened the gate through which the shooters proceeded on their way to the shooting, and secured the car used by the shooters to leave the area later. The jury deliberated five days, and the court found it necessary to provide an anti-deadlock instruction. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the government’s case was overwhelming. <em>See Dallago v.
