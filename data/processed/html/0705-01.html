Our narrow standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is well established.

Specifically, to convict appellant of the crime of Homicide by Vehicle While Driving Under the Influence, the Commonwealth must prove that the death in question was caused by appellant’s drunk driving. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735(a). The Commonwealth has clearly met its burden. The Commonwealth presented ample evidence that appellant was the driver of the subject vehicle and was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Empty beer bottles were found in appellant’s car and the Commonwealth presented evidence that the accident occurred when appellant crossed the center line into oncoming traffic. Clearly, the trauma of the accident killed Mr. Getz. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we find that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that appellant’s drunk driving caused the death of Mr. Getz.

Following the accident, appellant was taken into custody where he made a statement to police. Appellant does not suggest that the statement was in any way coerced or involuntary. However, the statement was made in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the trial court suppressed the statement on that basis. In the statement, appellant named several bars at which he had been drinking on the night of the accident. The police went to the bars and identified several witnesses who subsequently testified about appellant’s drinking and intoxication prior to the accident. Appellant now argues that the testimony of the witnesses procured as a direct result of his suppressed statement should also have been excluded as the fruit of the poisonous tree. <em>See Wong Sun v.

There, a defendant suspected of rape was questioned by police, who failed to inform him of his right to court-appointed counsel.

However, the vehicles were not impounded and were destroyed or lost before appellant had an opportunity to examine them.

Appellant claims that the Commonwealth failed to establish an adequate chain of custody. We agree. Appellant was subjected to two separate blood alcohol tests following the accident. The first was taken at approximately 2:37 a.m. and indicated that appellant had a blood alcohol level of .185. The second test was taken approximately two hours later and revealed a blood alcohol level of .12. However, conflicting testimony arose regarding the number of vials of blood drawn from appellant during the second blood test. The technician who drew the blood testified that she was not sure how many vials she drew, but that she <a id="p709" href="#p709" data-label="709" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*709</a>normally draws one to two vials for police investigation purposes. R.R. 255a. Trooper Martin, who witnessed the blood being drawn and transported the vials to Trooper Thomas, testified that he witnessed and transported two vials. R.R. 160-61a.

In the instant case we find that the Commonwealth failed to meet this burden with regard to the second blood test.

Our review of the expert’s testimony reveals that he extrapolated appellant’s blood alcohol level based entirely on the first blood sample. R.R. 352-356a.
