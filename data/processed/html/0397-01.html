Canavan. Following a brief trial at which Canavan conceded liability but contested damages, the jury awarded Ms. Hawthorne $ 4,566.84, the precise amount of her medical bills. Ms. Hawthorne filed a motion for a new trial as to damages, claiming that she was entitled to recover for her pain and suffering. The trial judge denied the motion in a five-page written order. Ms. Hawthorne appeals; we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>

In <em>Bernard v. Calkins, </em>the plaintiff-appellant “was dragged under the vehicle and down the driveway for some distance before appellee brought the vehicle to a stop....

Therefore, it is possible that though the jury found defendant responsible for plaintiffs injuries and liable for the cost of treating them, the jury had doubts about the severity of the injuries and the pain and suffering they caused. Both cases cited by plaintiff also involved permanent injuries, which were not alleged in this case. Finally, in this case there is no “objective” evidence “apparent in the injury,” such as the fact that the injury required surgery, as existed in <em>Bernard. </em>Thus, because damages in this case were contested, there were no permanent injuries, and there was nothing “apparent” in plaintiffs injuries that required compensation for pain and suffering, the court cannot find that the jury’s verdict was “beyond all reason.”</blockquote>

It would not be surprising to learn that jurors in automobile accident cases think about insurance, and even at some point make an assumption that one or both of the parties are covered by insurance. The alleged juror comments do not indicate, or even suggest, however, that the jury actually acted on such an assumption and considered insurance coverage in determining the damages award.</blockquote>

Ms. Hawthorne also asserts that the trial judge erred by declining to give a proposed instruction drafted by her counsel with respect to the quantum of proof required to establish proximate cause. The trial judge had “broad discretion in fashioning appropriate jury instructions, and his refusal to grant a request for a particular instruction is not a ground for reversal if the court s charge, considered as a whole, fairly and accurately states the applicable law.’’ <em>Nelson v. McCreary, </em><a href="/a2d/694/0897-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="694 A.2d 897" data-case-ids="11986348" data-case-paths="/a2d/694/0897-01">694 A.2d 897</a>, 901 (D.C.1997) (quoting <em>Psychiatric Inst. of Washington v.

In this case, the instructions as a whole were fair and accurate, and the judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to give the specific instruction requested by the plaintiff.</p>
