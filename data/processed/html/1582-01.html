WE URGE YOU TO TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION IN HANDLING THIS MATERIAL AND TO AVOID ACCIDENTAL INHALATION AT ALL COSTS. You can imagine what might happen if the glass container were accidentally dropped and broken on the laboratory floor.” Absent such information, say appellants, Olin’s teaching of the use of the new chemical as a solvent to form a paste or dispersion is “misleading to the ordinary chemist who might attempt to follow the teaching of Olin according to the ordinary and normal meaning of the words and statements used in the Olin application.”</p>

There is of record pages 7 to 23 of The Handbook of Solvents, Scheflan and Jacobs, Tab 29, which are devoted to “Safe Practices in the Use of Solvents.” On page 22, examples of labeling “dangerous” solvents, recommended by the Manufacturing Chemists Association, are given.

The board in its opinion found that appellee’s right to the filing date of 'his parent application was “not in dispute here.” That is to say, appellee is entitled under 35 U.S.C. 120 to rely on the filing date of his parent application. This would seem to be tantamount to a finding that the terms of 35 U.S.C. 112 were satisfied by the parent application. See Swain, supra. I am unable to understand how appellants can consistently concede that section 120 is satisfied and yet argue that section 112 has not been complied with.</p>

The Patent Office has not raised any question about the compliance of appellee’s parent application with the conditions of section 112.

Independent investigation reveals that section 282 provides as a defense in an infringement suit the “invalidity of the patent * * * on any ground specified in part II of this title [Patentability of inventions and grant of patents] as a condition for patentability,” and “invalidity of the patent <em>* </em>* <em>* </em>for failure to comply with any require<a id="p1589" href="#p1589" data-label="1589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1589</a>ments of sections 112 or 251 [Reissue of defective patents] of this title.” I am at a loss to see how these sections aid appellants in establishing that appellee’s parent application as filed was incomplete. It seems to me that appellants’ unsupported and broad allegation that Part II of Title 35 (35 U.S.C. 100-188), has not been complied with, is insufficient as a matter of law to warrant consideration.</p>

In that case the question was whether the description of the process in the patent was sufficient to enable a person skilled in that art to practice the invention. The court generalized broadly that where “the patentee omitted elements which he knew were important, fraud will be implied by the fact finder.” 92 USPQ at 265. The defendants had argued that the invention would have worked <em>better </em>if the patentee had disclosed certain procedural steps which, admittedly, at the time of the filing of the application were of questionable value. The court also generalized that a patentee must disclose “the -whole truth relative to their invention.” The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which found the patent valid and infringed.</p>

The statement from Rivise &amp; Caesar and appellants’ reliance thereon is not supported by reference to any statutory provision or by case law. Rivise &amp; Caesar refers the reader to section 13 in which the authors discuss and cite cases concerned with the alteration of an application after execution. This area of law was extensively reviewed by Judge Rich in <em>Vandenberg </em>v. Reynolds, <a href="/ccpa/44-2/0873-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="44 C.C.P.A. 873" data-case-ids="6079170" data-case-paths="/ccpa/44-2/0873-01">44 CCPA 873</a>, <a href="/f2d/242/0761-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="242 F.2d 761" data-case-ids="413673,6079170" data-case-paths="/f2d/242/0761-01,/ccpa/44-2/0873-01">242 F. 2d 761</a>, <a href="/ccpa/44-2/0873-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="44 C.C.P.A. 873" data-case-ids="6079170" data-case-paths="/ccpa/44-2/0873-01">113 USPQ 275</a>. Therein it was determined that the junior party was entitled to attack the sufficiency of the senior party’s application as filed, on the grounds that it had been altered after execution, where <a id="p1590" href="#p1590" data-label="1590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1590</a>the senior party relied on the filing date of the thus altered application as a constructive reduction to practice. It was there reasoned that a <em>decision on priority </em>rested on the sufficiency of the application as filed and the critical question raised, based on the allegations, was whether the application was void ab initio. An application burdened with such a defect could not, under the law, be relied upon as establishing a constructive reduction to practice because there was no sworn support for the altered application.</p>

Olin’s agent stated in a report dated August 29, 1955 that “violent clonic convulsions appeared in the mice within twenty (20) seconds,” after inhaling the product made by the process. Olin’s agent testified that this was “opposite to what was anticipated.” Olin testified that he had expected the product would be “an anesthetic of low toxicity.” Olin filed an application disclosing the product and the process. He did not disclose or claim use of the product as a convulsant. Krantz also conducted experiments with mice in January, 1956, and discovered the convulsant properties of the product. They then conducted experiments with humans beginning in September, 1956, and finally filed an application disclosing and claiming the process, the product made by the process and the use of the product as a convulsant agent. The record shows that the Patent Ofiflce, prior to the interference, considered the product to be unpatentable over the prior art and refused to add a count, upon appellants’ motion, defining the product, to this interference.</p>
