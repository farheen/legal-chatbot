The discovery rule does not operate to exclude from the limitations period the time following the occurrence of an injury when, due to the injury, it would be impractical for a party to seek out the cause. Rather, the limitations period set by the legislature includes adequate time to deal with the injury and investigate its cause in time to commence an action.

Thus, Appellees assert that the two year statute of limitations commenced in January or February of 1985, and, therefore, expired before Appellant initiated her third party action in March of 1987. The trial court agreed that the Appellant had commenced her third party action beyond the two year limitations period.

A en banc panel of the Superior Court reversed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment as to the wrongful death cause of action. The panel correctly noted that the two year statute of limitations period for a wrongful death claim begins to run at death. Thus, the court held that the third party action, filed on March 26,1987, fell within the limitations period as it was filed within two years of Mr. Baumgart’s death on March 31, 1985. However, the panel affirmed that part of the trial court’s order dismissing Appellant’s survival action against Appellees as having been filed beyond the two year limitations period.

Throughout this short period, the decedent was engaged in the dying process. The record establishes that the decedent was in pain for much of this period and under the influence of medication. I believe that a jury could easily find the decedent’s failure to discover the cause of his injury during this difficult period was due to “blameless ignorance” rather than “somnolence.” Thus, this is not a case where reasonable minds could not differ and, therefore, I would hold that the trial court erred in finding a lack of reasonable diligence as a matter of law. Certainly, this is not the type of case where the right to a grant of summary judgment is “clear and free from doubt.” <em>Hayward v.

    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[186,1693,752,703]]]'>The Opinion in Support of Affirmance argues that the discovery rule should not apply to the instant case because the Appellant knew of the cause of the decedent’s illness within the limitations period. It is also argued that we should take a retrospective view and determine whether the party seeking the discovery rule knew of the cause of his illness within the limitations period. If so, the Opinion in Support of Affirmance would hold that the party could have filed suit within the limitations period and, therefore, is not entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule. This approach creates several practical problems.</p>

Under the construct advanced by the Opinion in Support of Affirmance, this party could have filed suit within the limitations period and, therefore, is not entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule, although only having a day or a week to bring his cause of action. This somewhat exaggerated, although certainly plausible, hypothetical points to the weakness under this approach; it deprives the affected party of the full limitations period in which to bring his suit. Instead, a party may be left with a dramatically curtailed limitations period. Another hypothetical further demonstrates the weakness of the position espoused by the Opinion in Support of Affirmance argument. Theoretically, a party could discover the cause of his disease a week after the expiration of the limitations period. Apparently, the Opinion in Support of Affir-mance would apply the discovery rule and accord this party the full benefit of the two year limitations period because he could not have filed suit within the statute. What a difference a week or two makes under such an argument! I simply do not believe that the limitations period should be based on a retrospective determination of whether a party could have filed suit before the expiration of the limitations period.</p>
