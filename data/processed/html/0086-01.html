After her departure, appellant sought arbitration of several grievances against the firm, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation for engaging in protected activity, breach of contract, and a variety of common law torts. Under her employment agreement with the firm, appellant was required to arbitrate her contract grievance, but in addition she voluntarily chose to submit her discrimination and common law claims to the same arbitration panel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After an extensive hearing, the arbitration panel found that Groom had discriminated against appellant, but only in the manner and terms of her release from the firm.

Soon thereafter, however, some senior members of the firm began to be concerned about appellant’s work performance. There were allegations that she missed deadlines, treated staff and clients poorly, did not relate well to some clients, and threatened to leave the firm and take business with her. Robert Gallagher, the firm’s executive principal, became aware that clients had requested that appellant be taken off certain matters because her conduct at times was described as “out of control” and included the use of profane language during conference calls. On another occasion, one of Groom’s largest clients began looking for alternative legal services because the client was unhappy with appellant’s lack of responsiveness to its needs.</p>
    <p id="b116-9" data-blocks='[["BL_116.10",116,[998,1200,751,563]]]'>Questions were also raised about appellant’s behavior within the firm. She reportedly initiated several heated exchanges with members of the firm’s information services department that were described as disrespectful and “totally baseless.” From 1996 through 1998, Groom conducted an internal survey of its partners to assess work compatibility; appellant received scores consistently below the firm average.</p>

Because of the possibility that appellant might be leaving in the midst of that project, she was not assigned to work on it. When <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Prudential attorney Maureen Darmanin spoke with appellant shortly thereafter, appellant mentioned that she was considering leaving the firm because it had difficulty accepting women in leadership roles.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[162,571,752,667]]]'>After learning of this conversation, members of the firm’s executive committee met to discuss how appellant’s conduct should be addressed. Because of her recent comments to clients and her apparent dissatisfaction with the firm, the executive committee recommended that appellant be terminated. Initially, she did not choose to leave the firm voluntarily. However, after a special meeting of the principals on March 4, 1998, it was mutually agreed that appellant would resign from the firm, effective March 31,1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

She also downplayed the comments that she had made to Ms. Darmanin at Prudential, taking the position that, whatever their content, the conversation was within the scope of “protected activities” under the District of Columbia Human Rights Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Appellant also noted that even though she was not assigned to work on the larger ongoing project, she was able to continue working with Prudential on other matters. She further observed that during the special principals meeting at which her resignation was negotiated, the reason given for her release related to her communication to Prudential about her displeasure with the firm and its attitude toward women, not her allegedly unsatisfactory work performance or conduct within the firm.</p>
    <p id="b117-12" data-blocks='[["BL_117.8",117,[959,415,755,769]]]'>Less than a month after her departure from Groom, appellant was offered a position as a special partner with the firm of Hopkins and Sutter. In September 1998, however, appellant resigned from Hopkins and Sutter because she was in the later stages of pregnancy and was unable to access the firm’s computer system from her home, where her doctors had advised her to remain until her baby was born. Shortly thereafter, appellant joined the firm of Silverstein and Mullens, P.L.L.C., where she became first a non-equity shareholder and, later, a participating shareholder.</p>

Appellant and the firm agreed that a three-member arbitration panel would follow some, but not all, provisions of the American Arbitration Association’s National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (hereafter “AAA Rules”). The parties also agreed, with respect to the discrimination claims, to be bound by Title VII of the Civil <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and the District of Columbia Human Rights Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> As to the remaining contract and common law claims, the parties agreed that District of Columbia law would apply.</p>

The panel also concluded that the termination did not violate any of appellant’s common law' or statutory rights. The panel did find, however, that Groom had discriminated on the basis of gender “in the manner and terms of [appellant’s] separation from the firm.” Accordingly, she was awarded damages, but the award was limited to compensation lost during the transition from Groom to Hopkins and Sutter, certain deferred compensation that the firm already owed appellant, and costs associated with the arbitration of her grievance, not including attorney’s fees.</p>

The following day she filed a motion in the Superior Court seeking to confirm in part, and to vacate and modify in part, the arbitration award. On September 18, 2000, the panel denied appellant’s motion and also issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its original unpublished decision of April 17, 2000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In these findings, the panel listed as reasons for appellant’s limited award her failure to prove that she was released from the firm because of gender and the fact that she was out of work for only one month.</p>
    <p id="b118-10" data-blocks='[["BL_118.8",118,[1016,475,750,356]]]'>Shortly thereafter, Groom filed with the Superior Court a copy of the arbitration panel’s written ruling of September 18.

    <p id="b118-11" data-blocks='[["BL_118.9",118,[1015,876,751,879]]]'>On October 26 the court denied appellant’s motion and denied any subsequent relief, holding that she was not entitled to any further review of her grievance because she voluntarily submitted her claims to an arbitration panel and because it correctly applied the law to the facts of her case. Still unsatisfied, on November 6 appellant filed with the court a motion to reconsider pursuant to Super. Ct. Civ. R. 59, in which she argued for the first time that she had been released for engaging in activity protected by section 704 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-8. Without discussion, the court later denied that motion and dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>

It held that appellant had failed to demonstrate any reason why the record should be reopened because there was no evidence that the deferred compensation had been incorrectly calculated or unlawfully withheld.

Insisting that if the panel had followed the information provided in the Executive Committee Compensation report, it should have come up with a figure of $17,995, not the $18,031 stated by Groom. The firm acknowledges in its brief that it was likely that, when it was calculating the amount due, the percentage used by Groom was two-tenths of a percent higher than it should have been, resulting in a slight increase in favor of appellant. Because this error was so slight, and (more importantly) because it resulted in a benefit for appellant, the panel did not exceed its authority by approving it. <em>See Lopata, </em><a href="/a2d/735/0931-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="735 A.2d 931" data-case-ids="11538528" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0931-01">735 A.2d at 942-943</a> (only in exceptional circumstances, such as "gross mistake,” will a court interfere with an arbitration award).</p>
