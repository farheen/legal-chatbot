Respondent excepted to the Board’s findings, conclusions, and recommended sanction arguing that: (1) the disciplinary proceeding violated applicable Arkansas ethical rules; (2) the Board failed to consider or give sufficient weight to “undisputed” evidence and relied on other evidence that should have been excluded or given no weight; (3) respondent’s due process rights were violated; and (4) the Board erred in finding respondent guilty of committing a crime when he has not been convicted of the crime by a criminal court.

Respondent was hired by the law firm Ungaretti &amp; Harris (“firm”) in June 1994 to work in the firm’s Washington, D.C. office as a salaried partner. Before joining the firm, respondent had represented the receiver from a defendant in a Superfund litigation pending before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas and continued to do so until approximately January 1996. The state of Arkansas also was party to the Superfund litigation. During the pen-dency of the Superfund litigation, respondent and counsel for the state, Charles Moulton, Assistant Attorney General for the State of Arkansas, worked closely together, but respondent never represented Arkansas in the Superfund litigation.</p>
    <p id="b484-13" data-blocks='[["BL_484.14",484,[994,1268,754,1070]]]'>In August 1994, shortly after respondent joined the firm, he entered into a consulting contract with the state of Arkansas to provide legal assistance as an environmental specialist relating to the state’s natural resources damage claims. By its terms, the contract was limited to one year, beginning August 3, 1994, and could not exceed $4,999. In June 1994, however, before the consulting contract had been signed, respondent began billing his time at the firm for work relating to the state’s natural resource damage claims. Prior to signing the contract, respondent consulted with Mr. Moulton on a regular basis and continued to do so after the contract had expired. The firm was aware of the consulting contract and of respondent’s work for the state pursuant to the contract. In addition, the firm’s records listed Charles Moulton as a client.</p>

These private plaintiffs, however, were not listed as firm clients in 1994 and respondent did not segregate his time for services relating to their matter from the services rendered to the state. Apparently, there was no retainer agreement with either private plaintiff until some time in 1995. Because respondent never asked the firm to open a separate billing account for the private plaintiffs, he billed all of his time relating to the natural resource damage claims — including his work for the private plaintiffs — to the state from 1994 to 1997.</p>

In the memo, respondent provided details of settlement efforts and asserted that the state agreed to a contingency fee of 30% of what it recovered through settlement or judgment. As a result, the firm would forgo billing the state on an hourly basis. On January 31, 1995, respondent presented to the firm a letter agreement between the firm and the state. The letter was addressed to Charles Moulton at the Office of the Arkansas Attorney General and confirmed that the firm had been retained as outside counsel to the State in the Superfund litigation. Specifically, the letter provided that the State would pay the firm 30% of its recovery on its natural resource damage claims either through settlement or judgment, and that all previous agreements regarding the firm’s representation of the state would become void upon the state’s countersigning the letter. Based on respondent’s representations and the letter agreement, the firm agreed to represent the state on a contingency basis. The Hearing Committee credited the contrary testimony of Mr. Moulton, however, that the State had not agreed to retain the firm on a contingency basis or on any other basis to litigate its natural resource damage claims. The Hearing Committee also found that respondent forged Mr. Moul-ton’s signature on the letter agreement he presented to the firm.</p>

Timothy Eaton, who headed the firm’s litigation department, to review the status of the firm's representation of the state because none of the firm’s litigation partners had been involved in the matter. During a meeting with respondent, Mr. Eaton reviewed a draft of a complaint on behalf of the state. In addition, respondent discussed adding private plaintiffs to the action who would have standing to assert certain types of damages that the state would not claim, and represented that he had already consulted with the state, which agreed to the addition of individual plaintiffs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> According to Mr. Eaton’s testimony, this was the first time he had personal knowledge that individual plaintiffs would be added to the state’s lawsuit.

On June 14, 1996, the state filed a motion to intervene in the case and an original complaint in intervention, signed by Mr. Moulton and another Assistant Attorney General for the State. The <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>complaint was served on respondent as counsel for the individual plaintiffs. Respondent created an additional signature page with a signature above his name and that of the firm as “Counsel for the State of Arkansas,” attached it to his copy of the state’s intervention papers, and redacted the certificate of service to make it appear that copies of the state’s pleadings had been served on respondent and his co-counsel in this capacity. Respondent, who maintained the firm’s file for the natural resource damage litigation, then placed the copy of the state’s pleadings — with the added phony appended signature page and redacted certificate of service — in the firm’s file. Mr. Eaton testified that as of June 1996, he was not aware that respondent had filed a complaint in state court on behalf of the individual plaintiffs only and not on behalf of the state.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[186,1399,758,1251]]]'>In August 1996, Thurman Bennett, Jr., the former manager of the Vertac Chemical Corporation plant and one of the defendants named in the complaint, moved to disqualify respondent and the firm based on respondent’s previous representation of Vertac’s receiver. Other defendants in the court action (Dow Chemical Co. and Hercules Inc.) filed pleadings in support of the motion to disqualify respondent as counsel for the private plaintiffs. On November 8, 1996, the court disqualified respondent and the firm from further participation in the action, and the private plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary non-suit of the claims against Mr. Bennett. On February 14, 1997, the private plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary non-suit against the remaining defendants, which the court granted, and the same day refiled their claims in the U.S. District Court. Meanwhile, the state had already filed its own claims in federal court in a separate action and continued its action in state court.</p>
    <p id="b486-7" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[994,251,751,1209]]]'>In January or February 1997, Mr. Eaton traveled to Arkansas to determine the status of the litigation. Although respondent had advised the firm that one of the defendants was trying to disqualify him, respondent assured Mr. Eaton that it did not present a problem. After reviewing the court files and meeting with the firm’s local counsel, Mr. Eaton learned for the first time that the state court had disqualified respondent and the firm the previous November. While in Arkansas, Mr. Eaton also reviewed the separate federal court actions that had been filed by the individual plaintiffs and by the state. Respondent explained that for strategic reasons he had separated the two plaintiffs when filing their actions in federal court. During this time, Mr. Eaton and the firm continued to believe that the state was a client of the firm. The firm, however, did not send periodic bills to the state because it believed that it had a contingent fee agreement.</p>

Because respondent was to continue serving as counsel in the natural resources damage litigation, the firm asked Mr. Eaton to prepare and send lien letters to each of the named defendants to protect the firm’s financial interest in the litigation. On August 25, 1997, the firm sent attorney lien notices to the defendants in the state and federal court litigation based upon the firm’s services on behalf of the state and private plaintiffs. In the notices, the firm stated that it had entered into a contingency fee contract with the state and the individual plaintiffs entitling the firm to 30% of any recovery. A few days later, respondent called Mr. Eaton and explained that the firm’s assertion of liens created a conflict of interest because the individual <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>plaintiffs represented by the firm were objecting to the settlement between the state and one of the defendants, Hercules. Due to this conflict of interest, respondent asked that the firm withdraw the hens. After consulting with other partners, Mr. Eaton advised respondent that the firm would not withdraw the asserted liens.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.6",487,[202,696,755,1962]],["BL_487.7",487,[1003,248,749,85]]]'>Respondent’s fabrications began to crumble on the Friday before Labor Day 1997 when Charles Schlumberger, a lawyer in Arkansas who represented Hercules, called Mr. Eaton regarding the lien notices. Mr. Schlumberger explained to Mr. Eaton that Hercules was close to reaching a settlement with the state. In addition, Mr. Schlumberger advised Mr. Eaton that according to Mr. Moulton, the firm did not represent the State. As a result of this conversation, and after further review of the firm’s documents relating to the state and federal litigation, Mr. Eaton became suspicious of the signature on the firm’s supposed retainer agreement with the state. On that same day, Mr. Eaton called respondent concerning Mr. Schlumberger’s assertion that the firm did not represent the state. Respondent, however, assured Mr. Eaton that the firm did represent the state. When Mr. Eaton asked respondent about Mr. Moulton’s signature on the agreement, respondent became defensive and contended that the signature was genuine. A half-hour later, respondent called Mr. Eaton back and explained that he needed to talk to him over the weekend. The following Tuesday, respondent admitted to Mr. Eaton that he had forged Mr. Moulton’s signature on the agreement and that the firm never had an agreement with the state apart from the earlier, limited consulting agreement. Mr. Eaton and Mr. Ungaretti then called Mr. Moulton, who confirmed that the firm never had been retained as counsel for the state. As a result, the firm withdrew its lien letters to the defendants in the state’s action.</p>
    <p id="b487-7" data-blocks='[["BL_487.8",487,[1001,366,758,925]]]'>Subsequently the firm tried to ascertain what contingency agreements it had with the individual plaintiffs, the Sheltons and the McCoys. Although respondent advised the firm that the agreements were on file, the firm could not find any agreement in its files. The firm and respondent decided to prepare new agreements that would memorialize the interests of the firm. In the spring of 1998, the firm finalized and signed an agreement with the Sheltons. Later, respondent produced a written agreement with Travis McCoy dated in 1995 or early 1996. After agreements with the individual plaintiffs had been finalized and signed, the firm filed a motion for leave to withdraw from the litigation.</p>

The firm calculated that it had invested $1,416,924 in billable hours and $64,252 in expenses to the Arkansas litigation on behalf of the state and private plaintiffs. On October 1, 1998, the firm and its insurance carrier reached a settlement pursuant to which the carrier agreed to pay the firm $272,000 for its claims based on the “acts or omissions” of respondent.</p>

Although respondent did not testify during the hearing, he made an opening statement and cross-examined the witnesses. In addition, respondent sought to introduce three exhibits: (1) the billing records from Un-garetti &amp; Harris reflecting the time that respondent and others at the law firm billed to the state of Arkansas between June 1994 and September 1997; (2) a pleading filed by respondent in a Superfund litigation before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, in which he represented the court-appointed receiver for Vertac Chemical Corporation, and (3) an April 22, 1994 memorandum from Mr. Moulton and others proposing that the state of Arkansas enter into a consulting contract with respondent to assist in the state’s natural resources damage claims, together with a fax cover sheet to respondent transmitting a copy of the memorandum. The Hearing Committee denied respondent’s request.

The Board determined that although Arkansas Rule 1.6 appears to protect a broader class of information (“information relating to representation of a client”) than our Rule 1.6(a)(1) (“a confidence or secret of the lawyer’s client”), the firm’s disclosure did not violate Arkansas Rule 1.6 because, “[p]laced in the context of the Firm’s policy that it, ‘with rare exception, does not represent companies or individuals on a pure contingency fee basis,’ the Firm’s description of the pitfalls inherent in the type of action contemplated by the private parties reflected its own business practices as to whom it represents and revealed no information obtained through the representation of the clients.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>doubt that the Arkansas rule would apply to the limited evidence presented. <em>See Nance v.

During the hearing, respondent contended that the evidence was relevant because it showed that whatever resources the firm expended in the investigation and litigation of the claims was either on behalf of or benefitted the private plaintiffs — who were firm clients — and therefore the firm could not have suffered any injury by his misrepresentation to the firm that he was also counsel for the state. The Hearing Committee Chair responded by explaining that Bar Counsel had alleged a different basis for prejudice to the firm: that it would not have agreed to represent the private plaintiffs but for its belief that it would also be representing the state in the litigation.

The Board’s conclusion that respondent engaged in criminal conduct (forgery) in violation of Rule 8.4(b) was based on respondent’s intent to defraud the firm, which is a fact that may be inferred from the presentment of a forged instrument. <em>See Ashby v.

Although we understand the theory behind respondent’s due process argument, we fail to see how any further evidence respondent could have elicited during Mr. Moul-ton’s cross examination would disprove the Board’s finding that there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent intended to defraud the firm by presenting a forged agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Bar Counsel raises several procedural objections: that the issue was not raised before the Hearing Committee and that Rule 8.5(b), which was adopted after respondent's conduct at issue, does not have retroactive reflect. We perceive no substantive difference between our Rules 8.4(b) and 8.4(a) and the corresponding Arkansas rules, and respondent has not argued that they are different in language or application. We, therefore, see no need to address this argument.</p>

In its initial letter to Bar Counsel, the firm addressed respondent’s misrepresentations and forgery concerning his representing the state. There is no mention of the private plaintiffs in the letter. In a follow-up letter dated March 30, 1998, the firm provided a more detailed overview of the circumstances surrounding respondent's actions. The firm explained that "[o]ur law firm, with rare exception, does not represent companies or individuals on a pure contingency fee basis. We agreed to do so based on Mr. Slaughter’s representation that our client was the State of Arkansas.... The time, effort, and risk involved in these claims without the benefit of representing the State would not have <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>been an arrangement that would have been acceptable to our firm.

Although Bar Counsel asserts that <em>Gonzalez </em>is distinguishable, we do not need to engage in such analysis given that the record supports Bar Counsel’s assertion that the basis for the specification of charges and subsequent proceedings was respondent's misconduct <em>vis a vis </em>the firm, including the forgery of documents. The firm's adherence to its ethical obligations is not the subject of this proceeding.</p>

Respondent’s misconduct was criminal and extreme, and it continued over an extended period of time. Were it not for our deferential standard of review with respect to the Board’s recommendation, we would have no hesitation in ordering disbarment. We note, however, that Bar Counsel has filed no exception to the Board's report and recommendation and characterizes the Board’s proposed sanction as "warranted and not inconsistent with dispositions in comparable cases.” We have recently recognized that disciplinary proceedings in this jurisdiction are adversarial in nature, and that imposition of a sanction more severe than that recommended by Bar Counsel should be the infrequent exception rather than the rule. <em>See In re Ukwu, </em>No. 05-BG-788, <a href="/a2d/926/1106-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="926 A.2d 1106" data-case-ids="8376380" data-case-paths="/a2d/926/1106-01">926 A.2d 1106</a>, 1117 (D.C.2007); <em>In re Cleaver-Bascombe, </em><a href="/a2d/892/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="892 A.2d 396" data-case-ids="8985992" data-case-paths="/a2d/892/0396-01">892 A.2d 396</a>, 412 (D.C.2006). We, therefore, have decided to adopt the Board’s recommendation, which falls within, though on the lenient side of, the appropriate range in this area. We also note that respondent’s reinstatement is conditioned upon proof of fitness to practice, and that on this record, respondent’s burden, should he seek to rejoin our Bar, will be a very heavy one indeed.</p>

Respondent argues that the recommended sanction does not take into consideration the Hearing Committee’s unexplained delay in issuing its decision nor the fact that respondent “has never been sued or charged with a crime in any real court.” For the reasons explained in the text, our disciplinary decisions are for the most part independent of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The Board considered the Hearing Committee’s delay and concluded that although delays of this length are "regrettable,” respondent failed to demonstrate how the delay impaired his ability to defend himself during this proceeding. <em>See In re Morrell, </em><a href="/a2d/684/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="684 A.2d 361" data-case-ids="7349526" data-case-paths="/a2d/684/0361-01">684 A.2d 361</a>, 368 (D.C.1996) ("A delay coupled with actual prejudice could result in a due process violation.”). This court's further delay — while also regrettable— similarly has not prejudiced respondent, who has remained free to practice during this time.</p>
