Ten days' notice of the hearing, together with a recital of the protest, shall be sent by registered mail to the address of the applicant, and a notice of the time of the hearing shall be sent to each of the persons who signed the protest; provided, however, that it shall be sufficient to send notice to the attorneys of those who are represented by legal counsel. The hearing shall be conducted by the Commission and a record of the hearing shall be made and kept by the Commission. The record shall include the evidence, the Commission’s findings of fact, the Commission’s decision, and a brief statement of the reasons therefor.

The appellees, as did the Commission, place reliance upon an advisory opinion issued by the Attorney General. See “Public Access to Files of Alcohol Beverage Control Commission,” opinion # 87-1031, November 4, 1987. In this advisory opinion, the Attorney General was asked to determine the extent to which the public is permitted access to files of the Commission. The Attorney General concluded that while the Delaware Freedom of Information Act, 29 <em>DeLC. </em>§§ 10001-10005, provides the public access to the records of State agencies, "financial data has traditionally been considered private and intimate and so this common meaning leads us to conclude that the financial statements required to be submitted are confidential and exempted from public inspection.”</p>
      <p id="b1436-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1436.9",1436,[1052,2508,715,260]]]'>The applicability of this ruling is limited. The Attorney General’s opinion governs the access to confidential files by the public at-large, not by parties to a contested proceeding seeking information which the Commission is statutorily required to rely upon in deciding whether to grant or deny a license.</p>

In every appeal the cause shall be decided by the Court from the record, without the aid of a jury; and the Court may affirm, reverse or modify the Commission’s decision. The Commission’s findings of fact shall not be set aside unless the Court determines that the record contains no substantial evidence that would reasonably support the findings. If the Court finds that additional evidence should be taken, the Court may take the additional evidence or remand the cause to the Commission for completion of the record. If the Court finds that the Commission has made an error of law, the Court shall reverse or modify the Commission’s decision and render an appropriate judgment.</blockquote>
