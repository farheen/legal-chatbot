The southbound lane of Cedar Crest is in the City of Allentown, and the northbound lane is in South Whitehall. Officer Hum-mel testified that the vehicle crossed over the center line of Cedar Crest at least three times. The vehicle then drifted into the oncoming lane of traffic before making a sharp left-hand turn onto Parkway Boulevard (Parkway). Officer Hummel activated his emergency lights and siren and stopped the vehicle on Parkway, which is located in Allentown. Officer Hummel administered two field sobriety tests on Licensee, and he failed both. In addition, Licensee emitted a strong odor of alcohol, had bloodshot and glassy eyes, and slurred his speech. Officer Hummel placed Licensee under arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) and transported him to the Lehigh County DUI Center for processing.</p>

The Department subsequently suspended Licensee’s operating privilege for a period of one year.</p>

At the <em>de novo </em>hearing before the trial court, Licensee argued that Officer Hummel lacked authority to stop him in Allentown, which is outside his jurisdiction of South Whitehall. Licensee also contended that Officer Hummel lacked probable cause to stop him for a traffic violation. Because his arrest was unlawful, Licensee asserted that he could not be requested to submit to chemical testing.</p>
    <p id="b751-9" data-blocks='[["BL_751.11",751,[976,615,755,762]]]'>Officer Hummel testified that South Whitehall and Allentown are parties to a Mutual Aid Agreement (the Agreement), which grants the police officers of each department extraterritorial jurisdiction in specific circumstances and at specific geographic locations. Relevant here, Officer Hummel asserted that the Agreement gave him jurisdiction to enforce Vehicle Code violations that occurred on Cedar Crest. The Department agreed to furnish the trial court and Licensee with the Agreement within fifteen days of the hearing. The document was forwarded to the trial court but not to Licensee.</p>

However, the trial court also noted that in a refusal to submit to chemical testing, the legality of the arrest is immaterial. After his reconsideration petition was denied, Licensee appealed.</p>

At the hearing, the trial court ruled that the Agreement was an admissible document and left the record open for its submission. Reproduced Record at 42a-43a (R.R. 42a-43a). Licensee’s counsel, apparently, did not receive a copy. The trial court found Licensee’s <em>ex parte </em>argument frivolous because the Agreement was available either through the court or South Whitehall at any time upon request. The Department argues that even if it was error for the trial court to rely upon the Agreement, a public record, it was harmless error because the trial court found that Officer Hummel had authority to stop Licensee under the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act (MPJA), 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(4).</p>

Reasonable grounds do not equate to probable cause; where the police officer, viewing the facts and circumstances as they appeared at the time, has a reasonable basis for believing a motorist is operating the vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor the statute is satisfied.
