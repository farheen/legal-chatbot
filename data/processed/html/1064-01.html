The trial court appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Christopher and a hearing was held on December 17, 1990. On October 3, 1991, Linda Kling, the court-appointed counsel for Christopher, filed a report with the common pleas court, recommending that the parental rights of Atencio be terminated and the adoption granted.

The trial court found that Atencio failed to perform parental duties for a period in excess of six months, consistent with the ground for involuntary termination set forth in Section 2511(a)(1) of the Adoption Act. However, the court found that the record was utterly devoid of evidence concerning the effect that the termination of Atencio’s parental rights might have on Christopher, considering the fact that his two brothers still have contact with their father. The court concluded that absent such evidence, it had no way of assessing the effect of termination on the child’s needs and welfare.

Obviously, a major obstacle in establishing a relationship with Christopher was the fact that he resides in Pennsylvania, while Atencio lives in California. Atencio testified that from the beginning of Christopher’s life, Landis did not want the child to have any type of relationship with him. Landis did not inform Atencio of Christopher’s birth even though at that time Landis lived only three blocks away. Landis also did not permit Christopher to accompany his brothers to visit Atencio in San Francisco for the month of August, 1990.

It is disputed whether Christopher is presently aware that Atencio is his biological father. As the trial court noted, however, it is likely that his biological parentage will be revealed to Christopher in the future. Furthermore, the record is devoid of evidence that termination of Atencio’s parental rights would serve Christopher’s needs and welfare.

However, the fact remains that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the termination petition after a review of the totality of the circumstances. Since competent evidence existed to support the trial court’s conclusions, it was improper for the Superior Court to rely upon the evidence to the contrary. The trial court was in a better position to determine credibility, evaluate the evidence, and make a proper ruling.</p>

Our court thereafter reversed, finding that competent evidence did not exist to support the lower court's findings. Although similarities exist between <em>David C. </em>and the case at bar (i.e., geographical difficulties, and most contact occurring between the father and son consisted of sporadic birthday and Christmas cards), the distinctions between the instant case and <em>Skives </em>remain. In <em>David C., </em>there was no evidence that the custodian of the child attempt<a id="p1068" href="#p1068" data-label="1068" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1068</a>ed to prevent contact between the father and his son.
