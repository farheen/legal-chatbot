Wheeling (Szymanow-ski/Wheeling) appeal the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees Robert H. Brace (Brace) and BCD Properties, Inc. (BCD). The parties formed a partnership known as BSW to drill two gas wells in Erie County on leaseholds previously acquired by and still titled to Brace. The parties dispute whether their partnership encompasses two later developed gas wells <em>not mentioned </em>in their partnership agreement but drilled on the same leasehold titled to Brace and on which one of the partnership’s own wells was located. For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>

Pennsylvania case law evidences a long and tortured trail of attempts to make sense of phrases, parts of phrases, and words of art sometimes used in a common sense manner and sometimes used with a precise technical meaning, and all used in documents sometimes drafted with care and sometimes quickly scribbled by the litigants themselves. Many oil and gas titles trace to agreements from the late 19th or early 20th century and may use antiquated terms foreign to us today. A century ago, a farmer’s understanding of how the surface of his land would be used to extract the oil and gas lying beneath it would be considerably different from the understanding of the surface owner today who is acutely aware of the increased burdens on the surface imposed by modern extraction technology. <em>See McGavitt v. Guttman Re</em>

The fact, for example, that an instrument is titled a “lease,” “deed,” or “agreement” is not determinative. Even the use of the words “grant and convey” does not necessarily create a fee simple estate in the grantee. <em>See Pennsylvania Bank and Trust Company, Youngsville Branch v. Dickey, </em><a href="/pa-super/232/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="232 Pa.
