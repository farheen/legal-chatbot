    <p id="b215-18" data-blocks='[["BL_215.17",215,[947,612,754,244]]]'>Following a bench trial, appellant was found guilty of felony escape, D.C.Code § 22-2601(a)(l) (2001), based upon his successive failures to report to jail to serve weekend sentences. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b215-19" data-blocks='[["BL_215.18",215,[1312,952,23,31]]]'>I.</p>
    <p id="b215-20" data-blocks='[["BL_215.19",215,[947,1037,758,1040]]]'>In March 2000, appellant was convicted in the Superior Court of two counts of assault, and was sentenced to concurrent terms of 180 days in prison. As to one count, however, the court suspended execution of the sentence entirely, and as to the other the court suspended execution of the sentence except for ten consecutive weekends of incarceration. The court further ordered appellant to serve two years of supervised probation. Appellant was ordered to begin serving his weekends in jail at 8:00 p.m. on Friday, March 17, 2000. He reported to jail as ordered on the weekends of March 17, March 24, and March 31, 2000, but failed to report on the weekend of April 7, 2000, or thereafter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Consequently, he was placed on escape status and was arrested for escape on or about June 7, 2000.</p>

Appellant argued that he was not guilty of escape because he was on probation on the dates he failed to report to jail, and thus was not in custody. The trial <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>court rejected these arguments and found him guilty of felony escape.</p>

    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[169,539,758,655]]]'>Appellant argues that, because he was on probation at the time, he was not in “custody” for purposes of the escape statute when he failed to report to jail as ordered. As explained above, in the underlying case the court had suspended execution of one of appellant’s sentences as to all but ten weekends in jail, and further ordered him to serve two years’ probation. Appellant had only served three of the ten required weekends in jail when he failed to report for the fourth and subsequent weekends of incarceration.</p>

In analogous circumstances, we have held that probation is “tolled” or suspended when a defendant is in jail rather than under actual probationary supervision. <em>See Payne v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/792/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="792 A.2d 237" data-case-ids="9510077" data-case-paths="/a2d/792/0237-01">792 A.2d 237</a>, 240 (D.C.2001) (for purposes of calculating length of probationary term, probation is tolled while defendant serves weekends in jail); <em>Belcher v.

Even if appellant was under probationary supervision during the weekdays, his status changed on weekends when he was remanded to the custody of the Attorney General for incarceration by virtue of the sentencing order. <em>See Payne, </em><a href="/a2d/792/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="792 A.2d 237" data-case-ids="9510077" data-case-paths="/a2d/792/0237-01">792 A.2d at 240-41</a>.

    <p id="b216-10" data-blocks='[["BL_216.11",216,[967,597,757,1339]]]'>Relatedly, appellant argued at trial that he was not in custody under the statute because he was not held in a halfway <em>house </em>— i.e., in physical custody — during the weekdays. But, again, it was the legal restraint requiring him to report to jail on weekends, not where he spent his time while not in jail, that placed him in custody for purposes of the escape statute. <em>See Demus v.
