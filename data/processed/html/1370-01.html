On the other hand, there is no claim that any one of the patent structures of itself meets the structure of appellant, nor is there any claim that, <em>without </em>modification, the structural features of the several patents could be combined to produce appellant’s device. In the final analysis the meaning of the concurring decisions below is that the modifications did not involve invention. Appellant insists that they did involve invention.</p>
    <p id="b690-10" data-blocks='[["BL_690.10",690,[233,1716,1325,547]]]'>One of the complaints of appellant in the brief before us is that the board “failed to consider all elements of each claim jointly, but attacked each claimed limitation separately.” Inasmuch as appellant must rely upon structural differences for patentability, all of the claims being for structure, we are unable to discern how the issues could be intelligently determined without comparing the individual features of the references with the corresponding features in the device of appellant. Strictly speaking, no feature of appellant’s device seems to be new. The only new thing is the combination brought about by rearrangement, certain alterations being necessary to such rearrangement.</p>
    <p id="b690-11" data-blocks='[["BL_690.11",690,[234,2270,1320,93]],["BL_691.1",691,[85,246,1348,690]]]'>As has been indicated, the limitations claimed by appellant to distinguish his structure in a patentable sense are emphasized in the <a id="p1373" href="#p1373" data-label="1373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1373</a>quotation from Ms brief, <em>sufra. </em>The first of these is a <em>'•'■fair of </em>* * * <em>gas outlet fassages </em>* * * <em>extending through the wall </em>thereof.” Appellant states that Kehl did not disclose this. Such is true, but Anderson does disclose a plurality of passages. The second italicized clause describes the passage as being <em>“inclined toward said, main orvfLeeP </em>We deem the expression of the board as to the teaching of the Kehl patent concerning the proper angle between outlets, quoted above, sufficient upon this point as it also is with respect to' another emphasized feature — that of <em>“a freheating jet discharge orifice of smaller diameter than the diameter of said </em>* * * <em>main </em>orifice.” Surely, since the prior art shows orifices of varying dimensions it did not involve invention to select the size of orifice best adapted to the use being made of the device containing such orifices. In its first decision the board stated:</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.4",691,[92,973,1327,114]]]'>The Kehl patent discloses that the diameter of the preheating passage may be smaller than that of the welding passage or passages and also discloses that the outlets may vary in size and degree of angularity.</p>
    <p id="b691-6" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[93,1112,1328,646]]]'>Another limitation emphasized by appellant is that of an <em>aelongated or effective tafering </em>fortion” within the bore of the nozzle body. The Mandeville patent shows a nozzle having a tapered axial passage which seems to produce a mixing chamber for gases employed in the use of the blowpipe to which the nozzle is attached. The use of the tapered passage of Mandeville may differ somewhat from the use to which appellant’s tapered passage is applied and the locations of the respective tapering portions may differ, but structurally Mandeville’s tapered portion meets appellant’s tapered portion, and, since the patent and the application are in the same art, it is not seen how, so far as this case is concerned, invention may be attributed to a combination embracing this particular feature merely because of a difference in use or a difference in location.</p>
    <p id="b691-7" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[97,1766,1327,243]]]'>The feature most strongly emphasized by appellant is that of the location of the <em>discharge </em>orifices in the pair of passages. These orifices are disposed at a substantial distance behind the main orifice. This limitation appears in all the claims except claim 24. The prior art does not disclose an arrangement of this character.</p>
    <p id="b691-8" data-blocks='[["BL_691.7",691,[96,2016,1328,146]]]'>It was the view of the examiner, concurred in by the board, as epitomized in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, “that the distance in question was more or less a matter of degree.”</p>
    <p id="b691-9" data-blocks='[["BL_691.8",691,[96,2167,1329,186]]]'>There is in the record an affidavit by patentee Kehl. This affidavit seems not to have been before the examiner, it having been filed with the board in connection with appellant’s petition for reconsideration of its first decision. Of it the board said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b692-3" data-blocks='[["BL_692.3",692,[211,255,1327,155]]]'>

    <p id="b692-4" data-blocks='[["BL_692.4",692,[211,437,1323,96]]]'>We, of course, have considered it upon the same basis. The document, <em>inter </em>alia, states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b692-5" data-blocks='[["BL_692.5",692,[209,556,1326,239]]]'>The spacing of the entrances to the preheat discharge passages a substantial distance behind the entrance to the main welding-discharge-passage overcomes the tendency of the latter to rob gas from the former. The absence of this gas-robbing tendency makes it possible to employ a pair of preheat passages of substantially less cross-sectional area than the welding jet passage and still maintain excellent stability of the preheat flames.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b692-6" data-blocks='[["BL_692.6",692,[198,806,1334,866]]]'>By providing a pair of preheat passages extending through the wall of the tubular nozzle and discharging to the atmosphere a substantial distance behind the main welding discharge orifice requires a substantially different welding technique from that employed with the patented device. Due to the wide spacing of the welding and preheating discharge orifices, this new welding technique requires the nozzle of the Hutchison application to be disposed at a relatively slight angle (nearly tangent) to the work as shown in Fig. 5 in order to render the preheating: jets effective. The angplar- inclination of- the preheat passages toward the main discharge orifice plays a significantly different role in the new welding technique from that of the preheat passage of the patented device in the technique employed with the latter. In the Hutchison device, the preheat passages direct the preheating jets against each side of the V-groove of the seam at a point <em>substantially ahead of </em>and <em>toward </em>the welding point as contrasted with the patented device which directs a single preheating jet into the V-groove of the seam in <em>extremely close proximity </em>with, and <em>away </em>from the welding point. The preheating jets of the Hutchison apparatus maintains extremely hot an extensive portion of the unwelded work ahead of the welding point, and, therefore, .ample time is provided for soaking the preheat into the metal before successive portions reach the main welding jet. It is possible, therefore, to weld several times- faster with the Hutchison nozzle than with the patented welding device of Kehl.</blockquote>

We are impressed with its force. It is realized that “substantial distance” is a relative and somewhat indefinite term, or phrase, but terms and phrases of this character are not uncommon in patents in cases where, according to the art involved, the meaning can be determined with reasonable clearness. No objection was made below upon the ground of indefiniteness. While we do not regard this case as being precisely on all fours with the oft cited case of <em>Eibel Process Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota and Ontario Paper </em>Company, <a href="/us/261/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="261 U.S. 45" data-case-ids="6137018" data-case-paths="/us/261/0045-01">261 U.

    <p id="b693-3" data-blocks='[["BL_693.4",693,[95,358,1331,701]]]'>There is some argument in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, based upon the theory that appellant’s application as originally filed (it not being embraced in the record in that form and there being indications that it was amended in certain particulars) may not at first have made any point about there being a considerable distance between the main discharge orifice and the preheating orifices. However, the solicitor’s brief states that it is not intended by certain references made to the specification “to intimate that the reference to substantial distance * * * is new matter.” This does not appear to us to be a matter of moment here. There has been no objection respecting the sufficiency of the record filed, upon appeal, and we find no reference in the decision below indicating any question respecting the disclosures in the original specification.</p>
