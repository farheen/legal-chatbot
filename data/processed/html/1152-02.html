    <p id="b1195-23" data-blocks='[["BL_1195.22",1195,[970,1000,757,865]]]'>¶ 2 In divorce proceedings between Betsy Green and Arlin Green in Montgomery County, a question arose as to whether 60 shares of stock in Semperverde Holding Company, a closely held corporation, were the property of a 1987 trust created by Arlin Green for the benefit of his spouse and children, or whether the 60 shares were actually the property of a 1952 trust, created by Florence Green (Arlin’s mother), for the benefit of her children (Arlin and his two brothers Benjamin and Richard Green). The shares are valued in excess of $100 million, and disposition of the question would determine, in large measure, the amount of Arlin’s child and spousal support obligation.</p>

The trust instrument is entitled “THE ARLIN S. GREEN FAMILY TRUST — 1987.” A subsequent amendment to the trust instrument explicitly identifies Arlin S. Green as the “set-tlor” of the Arlin S. Green Family Trust. The question regarding “ownership” of the stock arose, however, because during the divorce action, Daniel Green (Arlin’s father and the sole trustee of the 1952 trust), maintained that he created the 1987 trust for the benefit of Arlin through funds he took from the principal of the 1952 trust. The Montgomery County Court ordered <a id="p1154" href="#p1154" data-label="1154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1154</a>the production of documents requested by Betsy Green which would be relevant to the inquiry as to how and why the 1987 Trust was created and operated.</p>

Curiously, the trustees took no formal position as to ownership of the Semperverde shares, and did not dispute that the shares represented the principal of the 1987 trust. Although the trustees were purportedly filing a first accounting petition of the 1987 trust on January 25, 1999,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the accompanying proposed schedule of distribution was more in the nature of a request for declaratory judgment.

Daniel B. Green, husband of Florence Green and father of Donor, is the trustee (the “Trustee of the 1952 Trust”). The 1952 Trust provides that the trust assets are to be divided into equal shares for each of Florence Green’s children, including Donor. The 1952 Trust is to pay income to Donor for his lifetime, but does not authorize the distribution of any principal to Donor during the lifetime of Daniel B. Green.</blockquote>

It was appellant’s contention that no issue of material fact existed because 1) the trustees of the 1987 trust took no official position with respect to whether the 1987 trust held the shares of stock, and 2) the 1952 trust had not come forward, via the filing of objections, to assert that the stock held by the 1987 trust was the property of the 1952 trust.</p>

Therein, by sworn affidavit, he asserted that he purchased the 60 shares of Semperverde for the benefit of Arlin from the corpus of the 1952 trust and placed the shares in the 1987 trust. Thus, Daniel Green asserted 1) that his use of the 1952 trust to fund the 1987 trust was an <em>ultra vires </em>and unauthorized transaction; or 2) that the 1987 trust was an authorized subtrust of the 1952 trust. In either event, it was Daniel Green’s position that the stock was held in trust for the benefit of Arlin under the provisions of the 1952 trust instrument.</p>

One of the bases for the motion for reconsideration was appellant’s averment that a recently granted motion to compel discovery entered by the Montgomery County Court in the related divorce action resulted in the production of documents which proved that the 1987 trust was created by Arlin Green and that the corpus of the 1952 trust was never used to fund the purchase of the Semperverde stock.

The court’s order of May 23, 2000, forms the basis of appellant’s appeal docketed at 1926 EDA 2000. In its opinion in support of the order, the court concluded that appellant lacked standing to seek an accounting. The court also found that because appellant’s “petition was filed after <a id="p1156" href="#p1156" data-label="1156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1156</a>this court entered summary judgment against her on the question of whether the 1987 trust was the owner of the Semper-verde stock, this present motion appears to be a collateral attack against this Court’s February 4, 2000 decree.” The court concluded that appellant was barred, by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, from relitigating the issue of which trust “owned” the stock.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant’s Delaware County discovery motion was denied. However, documents were eventually produced in the related divorce action pursuant to a Montgomery County Court order compelling their production. Those documents reportedly show that Arlin Green used his own funds to acquire ownership of the 60 shares of Semperverde which he then transferred into the 1987 trust. Moreover, certain correspondence and tax returns produced pursuant to the order reportedly proved that the tax treatment of the funds in the account benefited Arlin and was inconsistent with the claim that the 1987 trust was a sub-trust of the 1952 trust. These <a id="p1155" href="#p1155" data-label="1155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1155</a>contentions are not of record in this case and are not relevant to our disposition.</p>

We must note that in the related divorce action, the Montgomery County Court subsequently reached a contrary conclusion on the question of which trust "owned” the stock. By Memorandum and Order dated October 30, 2000, the Montgomery County Court found that Arlin Green himself created and funded the 1987 trust with the 60 shares of Semperverde stock. The court concluded that the 1987 trust's funds are available for the computation of Arlin Green’s support obligations. The Montgomery County Court's decisions related to this matter are the subject of appeals docketed at 3259 EDA 2000, 3263 EDA 2000, 3269 EDA 2000 and 3353 EDA 2000, which are not presently before us.</p>
