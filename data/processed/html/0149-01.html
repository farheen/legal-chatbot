Wilderman [mother] against Joseph Wilderman [father] for the support of their two minor children, ages fifteen and eleven. By order dated July 31, 1973, the Family Court directed that father pay to mother the sum of $24,700 covering support for the children from August 1970 through July 1973. Father appealed to this Court and has moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that the Family Court lacked jurisdiction to award reimbursement for sums expended by wife for past child support.</p>

This action was brought as a civil action. Civil jurisdiction of the Court, with the exception of habeas corpus, is found in 10 Del.C. § 921.

The rules which normally govern the length of time prior to filing of an action for which claim can be made are found in statute of limitations, laches and estoppel. In the case of Levine v. Levine, D.Del., <a href="/f-supp/209/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="209 F.

His conclusion was that Delaware does not have a statute of limitations applicable to obligations arising under a quasi contract. In this case, the parties have not raised the issue of whether or <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>not a statute of limitations is applicable.

This contention seeks to distinguish between an action for child support for the future and an action for reimbursement for child support paid. The applicable statutory provision merely refers to petitions for support of children. 10 Del.C. § 921(3). The language does not resolve this contention. The parties have not addressed themselves to the precise issue of whether the mother has a right of action to recover against father for monies expended for the support of the children. Rather, they have confined the argument to the question of whether the Family Court has jurisdiction to entertain such an action. The Court will, therefore, resolve the question dealt with by the parties on the assumption, without deciding, that the mother has such a right of action. Cf. Stat v. Porter, Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/314/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="314 A.2d 172" data-case-ids="11249559" data-case-paths="/a2d/314/0172-01">314 A.2d 172</a> (1973); Levine v.

Supp. 564" data-case-ids="91299" data-case-paths="/f-supp/209/0564-01">supra.</a> The Court of Chancery has held that by virtue of the legislative policy stated in 10 Del.C. § 902 and the jurisdictional provisions of 10 Del.C. §§ 921 and 925, exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Family Court with respect to matters involving support, Wife, P. v.

If a mother has a right against the father for reimbursement for support expenditures for children, the liability of the father must be founded upon his duty to support. Applying the same policy considerations which have led the Court of Chancery to the decisions referred to above, I conclude that, to the extent that a mother may be entitled to reimbursement for past expenditures made for the support of children, the action must be considered to be one for support of children within the meaning of 10 Del.C. § 921(3) and the Family Court has jurisdiction to make appropriate orders deciding the rights of the parties.</p>
