    <p id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[201,442,759,1211]]]'>Plaintiff LC Capital Master Fund, Ltd. (“LC Capital”), a preferred stockholder of QuadraMed Corporation (“QuadraMed”), seeks to enjoin the acquisition by defendant Francisco Partners II, L.P. (“Francisco Partners”) of QuadraMed (the “Merger”) because the consideration to be received by the preferred stockholders of QuadraMed does not exceed the “as if converted” value the preferred were contractually entitled to demand in the event of a merger. That “as if converted” value was based on a formula in the certifícate of designation (the “Certifícate”) governing the preferred stock, and gave the preferred the bottom line right to convert into common at a specified ratio (the “Conversion Formula”) and then receive the same consideration as the common in the Merger. The plaintiff purports to have the support of 95% of the preferred stockholders in seeking injunctive relief<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and I therefore refer to the plaintiff as the preferred stockholders.</p>
    <p id="b480-7" data-blocks='[["BL_480.7",480,[197,1685,754,708]],["BL_480.8",480,[1000,247,759,618]]]'>Based on certain contractual rights that the preferred had in the event that a merger did not take place, the preferred stockholders argue that the QuadraMed board of directors (the “Board”) had a fiduciary duty to allocate more of the merger consideration to the preferred. Notably, the preferred stockholders do not argue that the Board breached any fiduciary duty owed to all stockholders; in particular, they do not claim that the board did not fulfill its fiduciary duty to obtain the highest value reasonably attainable, a duty commonly associated with Revlon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Rather, the preferred stockholders contend that the preferred stock has a strong liquidation preference and certain non-mandatory rights to dividends that the Board failed to accord adequate value, and that as a result of these <em>contractual </em>rights, the QuadraMed Board owed the preferred a <em>fiduciary </em>duty to accord it more than it was contractually entitled to receive by right in a merger. The preferred stockholders seek to enjoin the Merger because of this supposed breach of duty.</p>

Under Delaware law, a board of directors may have a gap-filling duty in the event that there is no objective basis to allocate consideration between the common and preferred stockholders in a merger. But, when a certificate of designations does not provide the preferred with any right to vote upon a merger, does not afford the preferred a right to claim a liquidation preference in a merger, but does provide the preferred with a contractual right to certain treatment in a merger, I conclude that a board of directors that allocates consideration in a manner fully consistent with the bottom-line contractual rights of the preferred need not, as an ordinary matter, do more. Consistent with decisions like <em>Equity-Linked Investors, L.P. v. </em>Adams<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and <em>In re Trados Incorporated Shareholder Litigation,</em>

      <em> </em>once the QuadraMed Board honored the special contractual rights of the preferred, it was entitled to favor the interests of the common stockholders. By exercising its discretion to treat the preferred entirely consistently with the Con<a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>version Formula the preferred bargained for in the Certifícate, the QuadraMed Board acted equitably toward the preferred.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[180,476,755,980]]]'>For that reason alone, I would deny the preliminary injunction. But, given that plaintiff LC Capital purports to represent 95% of the preferred stockholders, has an appraisal right, and an appraisal action is therefore easily maintainable, I would be reluctant to enjoin the transaction and thereby deprive the QuadraMed common stockholders, who under any reasonable measure are entitled to the bulk of the Merger consideration, from determining for themselves whether to accept the Merger. The balance of the equities in this unique context would seem to weigh in favor of requiring the preferred stockholders, who I have no doubt are unwilling to post a full injunction bond, to seek relief through appraisal or through an equitable action for damages.</p>

But, the preferred stockholders do not allege that the defendants breached their <em>Revlon </em>duties as to <em>all </em>shareholders by approving a transaction that does not fully value QuadraMed as an entity. Instead, the preferred stockholders argue that the Merger consideration was unfairly allocated between the common and preferred stock. That is, the preferred stockholders do not challenge the overall adequacy of the Merger consideration. Rather, the preferred stockholders claim that they simply did not receive a big enough slice of the pie because the Board allocated the Merger consideration to the preferred stock on an “as-if converted” basis, which the preferred stockhold<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>ers believe understates the value of their shares.</p>

From early on in this strategic process, the preferred stockholders demanded a high price, even $25, for their stock, apparently under the mistaken view that they had a right to their liquidation preference in the event of a merger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Initially, some bidders indicated an interest in either meeting the preferred stockholders’ asking price — which would mean paying much more for the preferred stock than the common — or at least allowing the preferred stock to remain outstanding after the consummation of a merger. For example, Francisco Partner’s first bid for QuadraMed, made in October 2008, offered to acquire the company at $11 per share of common stock and to allow the preferred stock to remain outstanding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> And, a later bid, received August 31, 2009 from a bidder referred to as “Bidder D” in the proxy materials, proposed acquiring Qua-draMed for $10.00 per share of common stock, and $25.00 par value for each share of preferred stock.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> By “par value,” Bidder D seems not to have meant to offer the preferred stockholders $25 per share in current value but a security with the future potential of reaching that value.

In March 2009, the Board rejected this offer, and negotiations with Francisco Partners were suspended. And, after its initial approach, Bidder D made very plain its earlier position and explained that it “never intended to offer face value” for the preferred stock and was instead interested in paying $10 per share of common stock and reaching agreement with the holders of preferred stock on the terms of a debt instrument with a $25 face value, but a present value equal to $10 per share on an as-if converted basis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a> Therefore, the treatment of the preferred stock and common stock under Bidder D’s initial proposal and under the Merger is not as different as at first appears.</p>

From the meeting minutes, it appears that the Special Committee was wary of doing a deal that allocated more consideration to the preferred stock than to the common stock for two reasons: (1) shifting additional merger consideration to the preferred stock would cause the holders of common stock, who were the only stockholders who had a right to vote on the Merger, to vote against the transaction;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_35" id="ref_footnote_1_35">35</a> and (2) there was no special reason to deviate from the Conversion Formula provided in the Certificate for allocating consideration to the preferred stock.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_36" id="ref_footnote_1_36">36</a>

Had a particular bidder insisted, after negotiations with the preferred, on doing a deal with differential consideration, the Special Committee would seem to have had an open and receptive mind if the proposal offered a more favorable valuation to all stockholders. But even then, the Special Committee, I infer, would have harbored a concern if the allocation system strayed too far (in either direction) from the Conversion Formula in the Certificate.</p>

To do this fairly, the preferred stockholders argue that the board had to set up some form of negotiating agent, with the duty and discretion to exert leverage on behalf of the preferred stockholders in the allocation process. This need, the preferred stockholders say, is heightened because of an unsurprising fact: the directors of QuadraMed own common stock and do not own preferred stock. Indeed, the preferred stockholders say, every member of the Special Committee owned common stock and one member, Jurika, owned over five million dollars worth. How, they say, could such directors fairly balance the interests of the preferred against their own interest in having the common get as much as possible? At the very least, the preferred imply, the QuadraMed Board should have charged certain directors with representing the preferred, and enabled them to retain qualified legal and financial advisors to argue for the preferred and to value the preferred based on its unique contractual rights and their economic value.</p>

Given that the preferred stockholders had no contractual right to impede, vote upon, or receive consideration higher than the common stockholders in the Merger, the defendants argue that the Board’s decision to accord them the value that the preferred were entitled to contractually demand in the event of a merger cannot be seen as unfair. That is especially so when the preferred bases its claim for a higher value entirely on contractual provisions that do not guarantee them any share of the company’s cash flows if the company does not liquidate, and that do not even condition a merger on the payment of any accrued, but undeclared dividends. Indeed, because the QuadraMed Board honored all contractual rights belonging to the preferred, the defendants say it was the duty of the Board not to go further and bestow largesse on the preferred stock at the expense of the common stock.</p>

For example, a sizable premium to the preferred of 10% to 20% would cause a reduction in the common stock price of approximately $1.30 to $2.60 per share. Because four of the five Special Committee members own very modest common stock stakes, this would reduce those Special Committee members’ Merger take by, at most, several thousand dollars, an amount the preferred stockholders have done nothing to show is material to these directors.</p>

Admittedly, it does not solve for certain situations that directors might create themselves by authorizing multiple and sometimes exotic classes of common stock, situations that have led this court to, as a matter of necessity, consider the directors’ <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>portfolio balance,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_66" id="ref_footnote_1_66">66</a> but it at least does not exacerbate the already complex challenge of compensating independent directors in a sensible way. And, given the unique nature of preferred stock and the often-fraught circumstances that lead to its issuance, our law should be chary to somehow suggest that otherwise independent directors should be receiving shares of this kind at the risk of facing being called “non-independent” or, worse, being deemed by loose reasoning to be “interested” and therefore somehow personally liable under the entire fairness standard for a merger allocation decision.</p>

Even if the court must, as I think it does not in this situation, consider whether the otherwise independent directors comprising the Special Committee could, because of their ownership of common stock and no preferred stock, impartially balance the interests at stake, the plaintiffs have not advanced facts that support a reasonable inference that any of the Special Committee members are materially self-interested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_67" id="ref_footnote_1_67">67</a> I say <em>any </em>forthrightly. As to director Juri-ka, who owns a large common stock stake, a shift in the merger consideration of 10% to the preferred would cost him approximately $500,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_68" id="ref_footnote_1_68">68</a> That amount of money, of course, would be material to most Americans. But most Americans are not corporate directors, and do not have a $5.6 million stake of common stock in any company. And, the plaintiffs have not advanced any reason to believe that the hypothetical 10% shift would be important to Jurika. The man could be as rich as Croesus or Jimmy Buffett. The plaintiffs have a burden here and they have not even tried to meet it. As to the other directors on the Special Committee, they have failed even more obviously. Directors English, Miller, Peebles, and Pevenstein own only $61,284 worth of common stock and in the money options collectively. Even a fairly drastic shift of 20% of the merger consideration from the preferred to the common would only reduce those directors’ collective take by approximately $28,000, and the plaintiffs do not make any attempt to show that this would be material to these directors’ personal economic circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_69" id="ref_footnote_1_69">69</a> Thus, even under the plaintiffs’ theory, the business judgment rule, and not the entire fairness standard, applies to the Special Committee’s decision.</p>

But given the omnipresent possibility that any human judge can make an error, I note briefly another ground why I would not grant the preliminary injunction sought. The plaintiff here, LC Capital, purports to speak for 95% of the preferred stockholders. The Merger gives the preferred stockholders appraisal rights. Although the fact that stockholders have the right to seek monetary relief through appraisal or an equitable action does not invariably suffice to alleviate any threat of irreparable injury, the reality that the preferred stockholders have the ability to seek recompense is an important factor in the discretionary calculus whether to grant an injunction.</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[979,255,757,1024]]]'>Here, where a concentrated group of holders can pursue appraisal and an equitable damages case, I would be reluctant to grant injunctive relief that could harm the common stockholders of QuadraMed. These stockholders are set to vote on the Merger tomorrow. If I grant an injunction improvidently, Francisco Partners walks away, and the preferred stockholders were unwilling (as I expect they would be) to fully bond the risk of injury to the common, great harm could result to the common stockholders. Given that even under a 10% shift of consideration to the preferred stockholders, the common stockholders of QuadraMed are entitled to well over a majority of the Merger consideration, the balance of harms analysis, in my view, cuts against the issuance of a preliminary injunction.</p>

Imagine an issuance of preferred stock that had an absolute right to annual dividend payments of a large amount. The corporation's discounted cash flow ("DCF”) valuation indicates that the corporation could pay those dividends. The certificate of designation, like the one here, only gives the preferred the right to convert based on a formula, and does not give the preferred the right to vote on a merger, nor does it treat a merger as an event implicating the preferred’s right to a liquidation preference.</p>
      <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.6",492,[215,988,717,406]]]'>The corporation is valued fairly based on a DCF model in the merger. That is, the total consideration is fair. But, the conversion formula results in the preferred stockholders receiving a price for their shares that is lower than the discounted value of the dividends the preferred stockholders would be guaranteed to receive in the next five years. The board realizes this but chooses not to allocate more consideration to the preferred.</p>
      <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.7",492,[213,1401,718,325]]]'>This hypothetical case is harder because the financial analysis undergirding the board’s determination to proceed with the merger suggests that the corporation would have the financial capacity to pay the dividends to the preferred and that the certificate of designations would require that the board do so if the corporation remained as a going concern.</p>
      <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.8",492,[210,1733,720,774]]]'>But remember that the preferred would not have bargained for, in the context of a merger, any contractual protection other than the bottom line right to be treated on as converted basis and the board would not have dishonored that protection. Under the reasoning of Chancellor Allen in <em>Korenvaes, </em>the board would not have owed any fiduciary duty of loyalty to somehow adjust upward the preferred stock’s portion of the consideration. In that case, as mentioned, he sanctioned aggressive board action that clearly advantaged the common at the expense of the preferred. Because the preferred had bargained only for a limited right of protection in that context and the board has not deprived them of that protection, Chancellor Allen found that the board had no further duty and could take the action it did.</p>

The judicial sanctioning of the notion that the preferred get more merger consideration than they actually bargained for would, though, seem only to have appeal to those who believe that appraisal proceedings are now too predictable and non-burdensome. Indeed, the only thing rendering the future dividend stream in the hard case a non-speculative future source of income would be the judicial holding that preferred stockholders, who did not bargain for the right to block a merger that would result in the end of the corporation and therefore their future dividend stream, have to be compensated for the very stream that they did not procure a contractual right to force to continue. In that regard, the traditional appraisal use of the term "going concern” value cannot be rationally thought to have been intended to express the implicit notion that preferred stock, with no contractual right to block a merger or to receive any special economic treatment in a merger, can claim that the merger did not accord them fair value on the game theory-type speculation that: 1) if the corporation did not engage in a merger, the preferred stockholders would have received a guaranteed share of the company's going concern cash flow; 2) that although the preferred stockholders received the bottom line consideration they were guaranteed by the certificate of designation and although the total price paid for the corporation was fair, the preferred stockholders’ share of the merger consideration was less than fair in light of the <em>contractual </em>share of dividends they would have received even though they did not have the <em>contractual </em>right to block the merger that terminated that stream of future payments.</p>

Although they rely on the Board’s supposed failure to comply with the equitable duties owed to them as preferred stockholders, the preferred stockholders continually refer back to their contractual rights as the basis for arguing for special fiduciary consideration. But in the context of a merger, they had no right to demand a special dividend, consideration equal to the liquidation preference formula, or any of the other sorts of things on which they base their argument for higher value. It is only to the extent that a judge implies that rights of this kind, which could <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>have been but were not insulated by contractual protections from defeasement by merger, must be compensated for by equity that they have economic value in a merger.

If so, wouldn’t they have incentives that were not well aligned, as a whole, with the objectives of the corporation’s larger equity base?</p>
