At the time of her death, Washington and Gallimore were joint owners of an improved lot in the District of Columbia. After Gallimore’s conviction, appellees brought this action to quiet title, seeking a judgment declaring that they exclusively own the lot as tenants in common, free of claims by Gallimore. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted ap-pellees the relief they sought, holding that because Gallimore was convicted of murdering his joint tenant, D.C.Code § 19-320(a) (1990) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> operated to divest him of all his interest in the property he held jointly with decedent as if he had predeceased her. <em>Washington v.

We need not decide whether § 19-320 applies to these facts because we hold that the common law, at least with respect to the present problem, is not displaced by the statute and that the result under the statute and the common law would be the same. Neither permits a joint tenant with right of survivorship to enrich himself by murdering his co-tenant. Neither, however, would work a forfeiture of a murderer’s <em>preexisting </em>property interest as the result of his conviction. Therefore, we hold that when Gallimore murdered Washington, the joint tenancy with right of survivorship was converted by operation of law to a tenancy in common — the interest that most closely resembles the interest that Gallimore owned while Washington was alive — with Washington’s corresponding share as tenant in common passing to her estate.</p>

Washington was still married (separated but never divorced) to someone else when she participated in a marriage ceremony with Gallimore and they began to live together as husband and wife. About a year later, Washington and Gallimore purchased an improved lot on Seaton Street in the District of Columbia as tenants by the entirety. The parties agree, however, that because Washington and Galli-more were not married they could not take the property as tenants by the entirety and that the estate they received was a joint <a id="p1203" href="#p1203" data-label="1203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1203</a>tenancy with right of survivorship.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

A circuit court in Maryland convicted Galli-more of the murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

    <p id="b1261-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1261.6",1261,[174,1163,751,1085]]]'>Appellees rest their claim that Gallimore forfeited to them his interest in the jointly owned Seaton Street property upon D.C.Code § 19-320(a), <em>supra </em>note 1. Galli-more contends that § 19-320(a) by its terms does not encompass property interests acquired by virtue of the right of survivorship associated with joint tenancies. If we were to hold that § 19-320 does apply, then we would be required to apply its provisions to the instant case. If, on the other hand, we were to agree that § 19-320 does not apply, we would have to determine whether § 19-320 nevertheless displaced the common law with respect to the disposition of property received by a murderer by virtue of a right of survivorship. If § 19-320 does not affect property interests acquired by virtue of rights of survivorship <em>and </em>displaces the common law, then Gallimore would be entitled to the whole property. If § 19-320 does not displace the common law, then we would apply the common law.</p>

(2) If § 19-320 does not apply to rights of survivorship, does § 19-320 displace the common law with respect to property acquired by a murderer from his victim by virtue of a right of survivorship? (3) What result obtains under § 19-320? (4) What result obtains under the common law? We need to answer only the last three questions. We hold that, even assuming the statute did not apply to rights of survivorship, the statute would not displace common law with respect to property acquired by a murderer from his victim by virtue of a right of survivorship. Because we hold that the statute and the common law give the same result in the present case — a tenancy in common — we need not answer the first, difficult question of whether § 19-320 applies to rights of survivorship.</p>

A joint tenant with right of survivorship has essentially two interests: (i) a present right to possession of the property in its entirety and an undivided portion of its profits, and the right to alienate that present right during her lifetime, and (ii) a future right to the whole property contingent on her outliving her joint tenant and the joint tenancy not being severed during their lifetimes. The concept is that upon the death of one of two joint tenants, there is no transfer of the decedent’s future interest to the survivor; rather, the future interest of the deceased ceases to exist, the threat of severance by the other joint tenant is eliminated, and the present interest of the surviving joint tenant <a id="p1204" href="#p1204" data-label="1204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1204</a>in the whole property becomes exclusive. 4A Powell &amp; Rohan, <em>supra </em>note 2, ¶ 617, at 51-10 to -11.</p>

Because Gallimore must be considered to have predeceased Washington, appellees reason, his share of the joint estate passed first to Washington and then through her to them.</p>

The joint tenancy with right of survivorship is a convenient means to ensure that the legal title held by trustees or partners does not pass out of the hands of those to whom the property has been entrusted for management or other purposes. For example, the 1901 Code expressly recognized that trustees with management or other responsibilities could hold legal title to property for the benefit of others. § 1617, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Stat.%201432" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="31 Stat. 1432">31 Stat. 1432</a>.

A joint tenant may alienate his interest in the joint tenancy <em>in fee </em>at any time, thus severing the joint tenancy and destroying the rights of survivorship. 4A Powell &amp; Rohan, <em>supra </em>note 2, ¶ 618[1][a], at 51-15 to -18; <em>cf. Maynard v. Sutherland, </em><a href="/citations/?q=114%20U.S.%20App.%20D.C.%20169" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="114 U.S. App. D.C. 169">114 U.S.App.D.C. 169</a>, <a href="/f2d/313/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="313 F.2d 560" data-case-ids="181706" data-case-paths="/f2d/313/0560-01">313 F.2d 560</a> (1962) (holding that joint tenant’s execution of deed of trust in favor of <em>cotenant </em>did not effect severance). Thus, to use the Restatement’s own words, since it- is <em>not </em>“doubtful” that the murderer would have had the power to alienate during his lifetime a fee simple interest in his moiety in the absence of the murder, there is no chance to be resolved against the murderer. The Restatement comment cannot be justified on the policy ground we have adopted.</p>

While the murderer is alive, he may enjoy either the profits of his interest in the property or else liquidate his interest at its full value. Wade’s solution has no effect upon him. Should the murderer die without severing the joint tenancy, however, then the successors of the murdered joint tenant are favored over the successors of the murderer. We perceive no compelling reason for so favoring the successors of the murdered joint tenant. In fact, the most probable circumstance in which Wade’s rule would have practical effect is in the instance of a murder-suicide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> We do not think that the successors of the suicide are any less entitled to a share of the property jointly held than those of the victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Whenever a wrongdoer commits a crime and is punished for it, whether by incarceration, a fine, or an order of restitution, his or her next of kin are bound to suffer. They become the secondary victims of the crime. One incentive for a father not to murder anyone is that, if he does so and is apprehended, he will be punished and will not be able to care for his family. People who obey the law and work hard often do so for the benefit of their children.
