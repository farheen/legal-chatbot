The officer came over to the car and asked her for the registration, which she produced. According to the officer, while he was checking the registration, appellant got out of the car “on his own”.

While other decisional areas fall “into a gray zone”, as the commentary phrases it, the Standards recognize that the decision whether to seek to litigate the suppression issue again and in the presence of the appellant is not one for his personal judgment. It is at this point where the majority departs from the premise of the dissent. It is not the right to be present at a critical stage with which we are now dealing.

It concluded that he did not, finding that he could have added nothing by his presence and that the attendance by his counsel was sufficient to safeguard his interests insofar as the accuracy and fairness of the view were concerned. The Court was careful to point out, however, that if the defendant’s presence would have made a difference at the jury viewing it would have been essential to due process for him to be there. The rule set forth was that “[s]o far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, the presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.” Snyder v.

The sole purpose of the hearing was to present the facts surrounding the search of appellant and the seizure of the gun from his person, or elsewhere, so that the court could determine the legality of that search and seizure. Appellant, absent from the hearing, was deprived of the opportunity to advise his counsel with respect to the calling and cross-examination of witnesses as well as of the opportunity, if he so desired, to present his own version of the events. Additionally, an adverse decision rendered at a suppression hearing becomes the law of the case and is ordinarily binding upon a defendant at trial. D.C.Code 1973, § 23-104(a) (2); Jenkins v.

The appellate court is then only free to notice plain error affecting substantial rights, the damaging effect of which may, in turn, be negated if the error is found to be harmless. This type of analysis is precluded where, as here, a fundamental constitutional right is involved.</p>
    <p id="b273-8" data-blocks='[["BL_273.8",273,[955,421,754,1628]]]'>The majority suggests that waiver was effected in this case because the decision not to raise an objection may have been a tactical one on the part of the defense counsel and thus binding on appellant in accordance with Henry v. Mississippi, <a href="/us/379/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="379 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="11731118" data-case-paths="/us/379/0443-01">379 U.S. 443</a>, <a href="/us/379/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="379 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="11731118" data-case-paths="/us/379/0443-01">85 S.Ct. 564</a>, <a href="/us/379/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="379 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="11731118" data-case-paths="/us/379/0443-01">13 L.Ed.2d 408</a> (1965). Even assuming the rule of Henry v.

In <em>Henry </em>counsel failed to object to the introduction of illegally obtained evidence and the cause was remanded to determine whether the lack of objection was inadvertent. At the very least, then, this court would have to remand this case to see if counsel deliberately chose not to assert the right. In any event, the record is to the contrary. Defense counsel moved pretrial to suppress the gun, objected to its introduction at trial, and moved for judgment of acquittal both at the close of the government's case and at the close of all the evidence. These repeated motions belie the suggestions of the majority that defense counsel believed appellant’s testimony to be probative of guilt or that he wished to go to the jury on the issue of innocent presence near the gun.</p>
