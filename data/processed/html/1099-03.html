Nevertheless, I support the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that Section 411 of the Chanceford Township Zoning Ordinance, in its general application, is sufficient to comply with the terms of the AZA. <em>See Baublitz v. Chanceford Twp. Bd. of Supervisors, </em><a href="/a2d/865/0975-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="865 A.2d 975" data-case-ids="9036329" data-case-paths="/a2d/865/0975-01">865 A.2d 975</a>, 978-79 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005).

    <p id="b1145-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1145.13",1145,[951,836,755,690]]]'>As the majority notes, the AZA requires an affected municipality to enact zoning regulations preventing the creation of airport hazards if its existing zoning ordinance does not already do so by providing for permitted land uses and restricting the height of objects and structures lying within airport hazard areas. Further, the statute requires that such municipalities adopt, in full or by reference, the provisions of model zoning ordinances or other similar guidelines set forth by the FAA related to airport hazards. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 1102.</p>

Section 411, however, relates directly to the types of hazard that are the concern of the AZA— <a id="p1110" href="#p1110" data-label="1110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1110</a>in keeping with the AZA, it provides for the land uses permitted in airport hazards areas, restricts the height of structures and objects in those areas, and incorporates FAA regulations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> As applied, Section 411 merely shifts the financial responsibility of insuring safe airport operations from the Township and neighboring landowners to the party seeking to establish an airport by special exception.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Significantly, once the conditions of Section 411 have been met by a landowner, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10101-11202 (“MPC”), provides the Township with adequate mechanisms through which to enforce continued compliance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> For these reasons, Section 411 appears to me to be an adequate alternative to the enactment by the local governing body of zoning provisions limiting the use of neighboring properties.</p>

In this regard, Appellants suggest that the airport is exempted from the zoning regulation as a prior nonconforming use.</p>
    <p id="b1146-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1146.10",1146,[1013,731,751,811]]]'>Notably, the Township concedes in its brief that the airport was established prior to the enactment of the Ordinance in 1979, but suggests that it was not a public airport at that time, and thus, by implication, that the nonconforming use is limited to the airport’s operations as a private facility. <em>See </em>Appellee’s Brief at 1. Appellants, by contrast, claim that the airport has been operated publicly since 1975. <em>See </em>Appellants’ Brief at 7.

It is well established that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and that a writ of mandamus may only be issued where there is a clear legal right in the petitioner, a corresponding duty in the respondent, and a lack of any other appropriate remedy. <em>See McGriff v.

Furthermore, within the context of mandamus proceedings, “the burden of proof ... falls upon the party seeking the extraordinary remedy to establish his legal right to such relief.” <em>Werner v. Zazyczny, </em><a href="/pa/545/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="545 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="465149" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0570-01">545 Pa. 570</a>, 578, <a href="/pa/545/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="681 A.2d 1331" data-case-ids="465149,7868153" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0570-01,/a2d/681/1331-01">681 A.2d 1331</a>, 1335 (1996). Under my rationale as described above, the characterization of Appellants’ property as a prior non-conforming use is essential to the applicability of the AZA and, correspondingly, the availability of mandamus relief. Within this framework, I would remand for a determination concerning whether relief was available to either party in the procedural posture of this case <em>(i.e., </em>on consideration of the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment).</p>
