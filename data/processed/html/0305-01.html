On November 17,1978, Wayne and defendants stipulated that the action would proceed as a shareholder class action, and the Chancellor so determined on November 28th. Wayne’s action and two subsequent ones brought by plaintiffs Lindner and Pe-riné, containing similar allegations, were consolidated by Court order on December 26, 1978.

Neither case arose in the context of a proposed settlement, as does <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>the case before us. <em>Singer </em>was an attack on a consummated merger, while <em>Tanzer </em>was an attempt to preliminarily enjoin a merger. In cases that arise in the context of an attack on a proposed merger in a settlement hearing, <em>Singer </em>and <em>Tanzer </em>do not have any independent significance beyond the careful settlement consideration given to the operating legal principles at issue in the lawsuit. The Court of Chancery’s responsibility and function is to examine the proposed settlement’s intrinsic fairness. <em>Neponsit, </em><a href="/a2d/405/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="405 A.2d 97" data-case-ids="8046003" data-case-paths="/a2d/405/0097-01">405 A.2d at 99-100</a>; <em>Rome, </em><a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="197 A.2d 49">197 A.2d at 53</a>. It is not required that the Chancellor try the proposed merger as part of the settlement for <em>bona fide </em>purposes, nor conduct a <em>Singer-Tanzer </em>fairness hearing. Settlements are encouraged because they voluntarily resolve disputed matters. <em>Neponsit, </em>495 A.2d at 100, quoting <em>Rome, </em><a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="197 A.2d 49">197 A.2d at 53</a>.

    <p id="b362-10" data-blocks='[["BL_362.10",362,[999,369,750,750]]]'>Third, the shareholders and debenture holders have in fact been treated differently in the procedural aspects of the case. Although it was not court-ordered, the shareholders received notice of their class status in early February, 1979, when U&amp;I mailed to them the press release discussing the litigation. The debenture holders on the other hand, were not even included within the class until the end of April, 1979, nearly three months later. Also, subsequent to the Chancellor’s approval of the settlement, the public shareholders had to approve the merger and therefore had an independent right of veto not shared by the enlarged class as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b362-11" data-blocks='[["BL_362.11",362,[996,1142,751,943]]]'>Fourth, while we recognize that there may be no prohibition against the joining of shareholders and debenture holders in one class [see, e. g., <em>Wechsler v. Steinberg, </em>E.D.N.Y., 1975-76 Fed.Sec.Rep. (CCH) ¶ 95,449 (1976); <em>Handwerger v. Ginsberg, </em>S.D.N.Y., 1974-75 Fed.Sec.Rep.

In this case the Court entered its order certifying the class on April 25, 1979, at the same time the debenture holders were belatedly included within the class. The certification of the class “pursuant to Rules 23(a), 23(b)(1)(A), 23(b)(1)(B) and 23(b)(2) of the Court of Chancery Rules” thus occurred at a time when no debenture holder was a party in any capacity.</p>

Nor we do think adequate focus was given in the discretionary certification to the appropriate prerequisite subsection of Rule 23(b).

We read his order as not only challenging the Witmondts’ right to continue their litigation in New York commenced prior to the class expansion here, but also to threaten “any other action” arising out of “any matters, transactions or occurrences referred to” in the cases at issue here. This broad order affecting the rights of the debenture holders under an indenture existing independent of any shareholder interest cannot, in our judgment, be justified in the present context.</p>
