Following a consolidated trial, he was convicted of all charges except carrying a defaced permit and received sentences of ninety days in jail for the single continuous offense of unreasonable speed and $25 or ten days for each of the other offenses — an aggregate of $300 or 120 days.

Our Code provides that a person convicted of crime may appeal as a matter of right except when the penalty imposed is less than $50, in which case review shall be by application for the allowance of an appeal. D. C.Code § 11-741 (Supp. V 1966). In Yeager v.

District of Columbia, <a href="" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="90 U.S. App. D.C. 153">90 U.S.App.D.C. 153</a>, <a href="/f2d/194/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="194 F.2d 336" data-case-ids="3540791,507969" data-case-paths="/f2d/194/0336-01">194 F.2d 336</a> (1952), reversing D.C.

The right of appeal should not depend upon such inconsequential matters. We believe the only logical conclusion to be drawn from <em>Chambers </em>is that when several offenses, closely related in both nature and time, are prosecuted in one trial— whether they are charged in separate in-formations or as separate counts in one information—the total of the fines imposed is the amount which determines the right of appeal; and that if the total is $50 or more, a single appeal from the several convictions may be taken as a matter of right. In the case at bar, the clerk’s office was wrong in not allowing a single notice of appeal to be filed. We shall therefore consider the merits of each of appellant’s convictions.</p>

The arresting officer testified that appellant was found in the front seat of the car, and that the car was registered in the name of appellant’s uncle. Another officer testified that the car had passed him while he was parked at the curb. When he yelled to the driver to turn on his lights, the latter turned his head toward him and the officer was able to see clearly that it was appellant. This same officer appeared at the scene of the arrest a short time later, identified appellant (who was then sitting with another man in the rear of a police car), and charged him with operating without lights. Appellant and the other occupants of the car testified that the operator was an unidentified person known only by the nicknames “Scotch” and “Country.”</p>

Although no exact speed was confirmed, there was testimony that the car pulled away from the curb at a “high rate of speed” and that in another area it was traveling “in excess of twenty-five” miles per hour. This testimony, plus judicial notice of the speed limits on the streets involved, was sufficient to establish a violation of the unreasonable speed regulation.</p>

There is no evidence, however, that appellant failed to obey any red lights or that he was driving on the wrong side of the street. The record merely indicates that the arresting officer recited that he charged appellant with these violations. This is not sufficient evidence to prove that the violations occurred, and these convictions must be reversed. There is also no substantiation for three of the seven counts of failure to slow at intersections since the officer’s testimony does not show that the car traveled through these intersections. These three convictions must also be reversed.</p>
