On that date, appellant and two accomplices, co-defendant George Williams, age 20, and Alvin “Eyeball” Morgan, age 14, concocted a scheme to rob Fleming who lived with his son Francis two blocks away at 5522 Sprague Street in Philadelphia. Appellant armed himself with a sawed-off 20-gauge pump action shotgun, and stated that he would “shoot [Fleming] if he had to.” Appellant and his coconspirators then proceeded to Fleming’s home.</p>

Appellant loaded his shotgun with a yellow shell containing a single slug, and knocked on the door. Receiving no immediate answer, appellant kicked the door, damaging it. The elderly Mr. Fleming appeared, came onto the porch confronting the intruders, and turned toward Williams. Williams, cursing, pointed his handgun at Fleming and repeatedly pulled the trigger, but the gun merely made a clicking sound. Appellant, who had retreated off the porch, then stepped out of the shadows, placed the muzzle of his shotgun against Fleming’s back and fired.</p>

Appellant and Williams were tried together by a jury before the Honorable John J. Poserina on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy, robbery, possession of an instrument of crime, and carrying firearms on public streets.

A hearing on these allegations was held on September 28, 1993, at which the testimony of appellant’s trial counsel was presented. On December 1, 1993, the trial court denied appellant’s post-trial motions and formally imposed a sentence of death as well as a consecutive term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years for appellant’s robbery conviction.

First, a defendant must show his claim to be of arguable merit. In the event this threshold requirement is satisfied, the defendant must next establish that defense counsel had no reasonable basis for undertaking or failing to undertake the act or omission in question. Finally, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that but for the act or omission in question the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. In other words, that the defendant must have suffered actual prejudice from the act or omission. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b1377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1377.5",1377,[197,461,753,1030]]]'>This contention, however, ignores the fact that during the September 28, 1998, hearing on post-trial motions, appellant’s trial counsel testified that he had not focused on character evidence in his summation, and had not requested a jury instruction concerning character testimony because throughout the trial, he had conceded appellant’s involvement in the Fleming homicide and instead argued that the facts of the case established no more than murder in the second degree. In light of this strategy, trial counsel concluded that it would have been unproductive to ask the jury to consider the good character of an individual who had admitted participating in an attempted robbery which resulted in the death of the victim. This testimony clearly establishes that trial counsel possessed a reasonable basis for his actions. Thus, appellant’s claim fails the second prong of the test articulated in <em>Douglas, supra.</em>

At the hearing on post-trial motions, appellant’s trial counsel testified that the character witnesses had been called at his client’s insistence and against his advice. Trial counsel further stated that his fears had proved to be well-founded since the half-hearted testimony provided by these witnesses could at best be characterized as weak, and had not made a particularly positive impression on the jury. (Notes of Testimony, 9/28/93 at 10). Angelique Rainey merely testified that appellant had a good reputation as a result of his work “around the house” (Notes of Testimony (N.T. 12/26/91 at 56). Patricia and Rufus Weary, meanwhile, did not even appear in court until after appellant and his co-defendant had rested, and the co-defendant’s counsel had finished his closing argument. Appellant was then permitted to reopen his case and call these witnesses. Patricia Weary characterized appellant’s reputation in the community as “well good” and offered no further elaboration. Rufus Weary, in turn, stated that appellant’s reputation had been, “for the years we was hanging together, good.”</p>

Prior to testifying, Lewis had given three statements to the police. In the first two, Lewis identified appellant and Williams as the perpetrators, but omitted the fact that he had given the co-defendant a gun. At the time of his second statement, Lewis had been incarcerated following an adjudication of delinquency on an unrelated matter. Lewis subsequently completed his detention and was released on April 5, 1991. He then went to college. Lewis was interviewed a third time on December 11, 1991. He again identified appellant and Williams as the robbers, but for the first time he also admitted giving Williams a handgun.</p>

In <em>Borders, </em>we held that a defendant is entitled to impeach a witness through the introduction of any juvenile charges pending against the witness. This argument, however, completely ignores the fact that at the time of trial and at the time of his third statement, Lewis had already served his juvenile detention, and was no longer subject to bias from this perspective. Thus, appellant’s claim is without arguable merit. In fact, the Commonwealth correctly notes that Lewis’s statement was particularly reliable because he had admitted giving a handgun to Williams; therefore, exposing himself to criminal prosecution at a time when he had no juvenile (or other) cases pending.</p>

Detective Walsh’s remark was de minimis and was immediately cured by the prosecutor and later by the trial court’s instructions. In addition, due to the context of the statement, it is entirely likely that the jury may have thought that Detective Walsh was referring to Mike Williams rather than appellant. Finally, there already existed overwhelming evidence identifying appellant as the victim’s killer. Thus, Detective Walsh’s remark was harmless.</p>

These remarks did not facially implicate appellant, but rather implicated appellant through inferences raised from the testimony of Alvin Morgan. The U.S. Supreme Court has previously held that such inferential incrimination from a redacted statement does not constitute a violation of a defendant’s right to confrontation. <em>Richardson v.
