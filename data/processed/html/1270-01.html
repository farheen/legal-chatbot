Arnold (“plaintiff’) that the trial court erred in granting defendants’ summary judgment motion and denying his own. This suit arose out of a merger (the “Merger”) of BBC Connecticut Holding Corporation (“BBC”), a wholly-owned Connecticut subsidiary of Bank of Boston Corporation (“BoB”), a Massachusetts corporation, into Society for Savings (“Society”), a wholly-owned Connecticut subsidiary of Society for Savings Bancorp, Incorporated (“Bancorp”), a Delaware corporation. In accordance with the Merger, Bancorp ultimately merged with BoB. Plaintiff was at all relevant times a Bancorp stockholder. Plaintiff named as defendants Bancorp, BoB, BBC, and twelve of fourteen members of Baneorp’s board of directors (collectively “defendants”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Plaintiff also claims that the Court of Chancery erroneously held that the duties enunciated in <em>Revlon</em>

      <em> </em>and its progeny were not implicated. Also at issue on this appeal is whether or not the individual defendants can be held liable if a disclosure violation is found in view of the exemption from liability provision in Ban-corp’s certificate of incorporation, adopted pursuant to 8 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 102(b)(7) (“Section 102(b)(7)”). For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Court of Chancery erred in failing to find that plaintiffs claim that the partial disclosures in the Merger proxy statement made it materially misleading with respect to one particular fact. In all other respects we find that the trial court committed no reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b1331-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1331.11",1331,[970,401,758,613]]]'>We further hold that, in all events, the limitation provision in Bancorp’s certificate of incorporation shields the individual defendants from personal liability for the disclosure violation found to exist in this ease. Finally, we hold that plaintiffs claim that <em>Revlon </em>was implicated under the circumstances of this ease is without merit. Therefore, we REVERSE in part and AFFIRM in part the judgment of the Court of Chancery, and REMAND the case to the Court of Chancery for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Under the terms of the Merger, Ban-corp stockholders would receive 0.80 shares of BoB in exchange for each Bancorp share based on the trading price of BoB shares at closing (subject to an adjustable $20 per share cap). Plaintiff alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties of care and candor in the proxy statement dated February 1, 1993 (the “proxy statement”) which was sent to stockholders seeking approval of the Merger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The trial court deferred ruling on these motions at that time. The Merger was effected on July 9, 1993. On that date, plaintiff filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. In an opinion and order dated December 15, 1993 (the “Opinion”), the Court of Chancery granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs cross motion, holding that defendants did not violate their duty of disclosure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Court found that the alleged omissions and misrepresentations were immaterial as a matter of law.

    <p id="b1332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1332.5",1332,[171,1142,756,557]]]'>The following operative facts govern this litigation. In 1991 Bancorp was suffering from severe financial distress, including an imminent threat of regulatory takeover, due mostly to Society’s poor performance. In fact, Bancorp was being kept afloat mainly by the high profitability of Fidelity Acceptance Corporation (“FAC”), a Society subsidiary. Early that year, Bancorp began investigating whether it could “unlock” FAC’s value from Bancorp’s other poorly-performing assets.</p>
    <p id="b1332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1332.6",1332,[169,1729,754,708]],["BL_1332.7",1332,[980,228,749,181]]]'>On April 30, 1991, Bancorp publicly announced that it had retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company (“Goldman”) to identify transactions that would enhance stockholder value. After having canvassed the market for potential acquirors, Goldman informed the Ban-corp board of directors (the “board”) that there was a paucity of interest in Bancorp. Bancorp then considered selling itself in four parts — Society’s deposits, Society’s investment and loan assets, FAC, and a “stub” entity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Under this scenario, the sale of each part was contingent upon sale of the others. As part of this effort, Goldman solicited bids for FAC and for Society’s deposits, informing bidders in late 1991 and early 1992 that Bancorp was still available for sale in its entirety. Offers for Bancorp were not forthcoming.</p>
    <p id="b1332-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1332.10",1332,[978,436,752,277]]]'>Although FAC was not offered for sale separately, Goldman received nine bids solely for FAC. Eventually, Norwest Corporation (“Norwest”) emerged as the highest bidder, with a bid for FAC forecasted to be approximately $275 million as of December 31,1992.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b1332-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1332.11",1332,[976,741,752,612]]]'>Norwest’s bid for FAC also was conditioned on the securing of all requisite regulatory approvals, among other provisos. Regulatory approval, however, turned out to be problematic. The board engaged several financial advisors to evaluate potential profit-maximizing alternatives, including Goldman, Salomon Brothers Incorporated (“Salomon”), and Merrill, Lynch, Fenner, Smith &amp; Pierce, Incorporated (“Merrill Lynch”), all of whom confirmed the unlikelihood of FAC’s sale being effected without selling simultaneously the remaining components of Bancorp.</p>
    <p id="b1332-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1332.12",1332,[971,1380,754,801]]]'>On May 28, 1992, Goldman presented the following mutually-dependent proposal (the “May Proposal”) to the board: BoB would purchase Society’s deposits; Norwest would purchase FAC; Goldman itself would purchase much of Society’s loan portfolio; and Society’s unsalable assets would be relegated to the stub. Goldman advised the board that no such transaction had ever been executed successfully. Also, all three potential purchasers insisted that their purchases be secured by the stub and that sufficient cash be reserved to indemnify them against any asset losses. Given that Society’s liabilities exceeded its assets, the reserve cash would have been transferred to the stub from FAC’s sale proceeds.</p>
    <p id="b1332-16" data-blocks='[["BL_1332.13",1332,[968,2208,753,229]],["BL_1333.1",1333,[189,247,754,423]]]'>Goldman estimated that stockholders could receive a net value of $15.94 per share, subject to market fluctuations. That value could be increased should a positive value of $3.32 per share for the stub assets materialize. In <a id="p1275" href="#p1275" data-label="1275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1275</a>that scenario, Goldman estimated a total value of $229.4 million or $19.26 per share. The stub value was very uncertain, however. In fact, Director David T. Chase (“Chase”) opined to the board that the stub more likely had a negative value of $3 per share. If that were the case the net value receivable by Bancorp stockholders would amount to approximately $13 per share.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

    <p id="b1333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1333.4",1333,[190,695,752,612]]]'>Lawrence Connell (“Connell”), Bancorp’s recently-hired Chief Executive Officer, President and board member, recommended that the board pursue the May Proposal, notwithstanding potential associated risks. After deliberations, however, the board rejected the May Proposal, five in favor and eight opposed (5-8),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> as too risky and speculative. The board thereafter terminated Goldman and issued a press release indicating that Bancorp intended to focus on strengthening itself as an independent entity.

Connell enlisted Goldman’s assistance as well as help from Bancorp senior personnel in the negotiations. In June or July, 1992, Connell casually mentioned BoB’s interest to the Chairman. Connell did not formally disclose these developments to any board members until BoB sent a written expression of interest on August 24, 1992, which Connell relayed in substance to some board members.</p>

The board discussed the terms of BoB’s offer — each Bancorp share would be exchanged for 0.78 BoB share, with BoB to receive no-shop and lock-up rights. BoB conditioned the offer on quick approval by the board. The board negotiated with BoB over the next three days and, when the board reconvened on August 31, approved the Merger. The final terms were as follows: the exchange ratio was increased in favor of Bancorp stockholders from 0.78 to 0.80, BoB was granted a share cap of $20 and a modified lock-up agreement, and Bancorp obtained a “fiduciary out” provision as part of the no-shop clause. The initial vote was eight in favor, one opposed, with five abstentions (8-1-5). After BoB satisfied the concerns of certain board members,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> twelve directors voted in favor and two (the Chairman and Weiner-man) abstained (12-0-2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Under the terms of the Merger, Bancorp stockholders would receive $17.30 per share as of August 28, 1992.</p>

The proxy statement did not disclose the contingent $275 million bid by Nor-west for FAC or Goldman’s qualified estimate of $19.26 for Bancorp shares, both of which were generated in connection with the failed May Proposal. On March 4, 1993, Bancorp’s stockholders approved the Merger <a id="p1276" href="#p1276" data-label="1276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1276</a>with 7,750,253 shares in favor,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> 1,389,272 in opposition, 264,146 abstaining, and 2,552,297 not voting.

      <em>Background. </em>In April of 1991, Bancorp engaged the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs to aid it in evaluating various possible financial or strategic alternatives intended to maximize stockholder value, which engagement was publicly announced on April 30, 1991. At the time of Goldman Sachs’ engagement, the Bancorp Board recognized that the strategic alternatives to be considered might include, but not be limited to, the sale of Bancorp or the sale of Society. During the spring of 1991, Society was in the midst of an examination being conducted by the FDIC and was experiencing asset deterioration.

During the summer and early fall of 1991, management and Goldman Sachs also studied the possibility of a transaction structured as a deposit assumption by a bank or thrift and an asset sale to one or more third parties. During the summer of 1991, Goldman Sachs, on behalf of Bancorp, solicited indications of interest to acquire Bancorp or Society. By the fall of 1991, these efforts had produced no attractive opportunities for the sale of Bancorp or the sale of Society, at which point there began a more intensive evaluation of a three-part strategy in which Society’s loan and investment assets, its ownership interest in FAC and its retail branch bank system would be sold in separate transactions. After Baneorp’s management and Goldman Sachs had investigated such transactions for several months, which investigation included contacting certain entities previously contacted as well as other parties and evaluating certain potential indications of interest, the Bancorp Board of Directors, at a meeting held on May 28, 1992, considered whether to pursue a series of transactions in which (a) FAC would be sold to a third party, (b) substantially all of Society’s assets would be sold to an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, (c) the remainder of Society’s assets (other than cash and its branches) would be placed in a “stub bank” or similar entity and distributed to Bancorp’s stockholders and (d) Bancorp (which would then consist of Society’s deposits and certain other liabilities, its branches and the cash received from the sale of FAC and the sale of assets) would be merged with a subsidiary of Bank of Boston. In such merger, the holders of Bancorp Common Stock would have received shares of Bank of Boston Common Stock. The transactions discussed at the May 28, 1992 Bancorp Board meeting were tentative and the Board was advised that, in light of uncertainties involving the value of certain assets, the value ultimately distributable to stockholders could only be estimated. The Bancorp Board was also informed that a number of steps would have to be completed before the transactions could proceed. These steps included the completion of the sale of FAC in an auction process, the completion by the Goldman Sachs affiliate of its due diligence on Society’s assets and the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements with all interested parties.</blockquote>

The record is somewhat inconsistent regarding whether regulatory approval of FAC’s standalone sale was merely unlikely or impossible. Milton R. Berlinski (“Berlinski”), a Goldman Vice President, stated in his affidavit that "a sale of FAC independently of the rest of Society was not possible.” Connell in his affidavit stated that "selling FAC ... was simply <em>not </em>a viable option." Chase in his deposition stated that “[FAC] could not be sold by itself.” A document promulgated by Salomon titled "Regional Overview,” however, states that ”[i]t is highly unlikely that proceeds from the sale of FAC could be realized ... due to regulatory constraints.” A document Merrill Lynch produced, titled "Capital Alternatives,” states that "it is questionable whether regulators would give approval of the dividend or even sale of FAC.” Plaintiff’s expert, Professor Donald J. Puglisi ("Professor Puglisi”), in an affidavit submitted on plaintiff's behalf, stated in conclusory terms: "There is no basis for arguing that FAC could not be sold. Indeed, the Goldman Sachs auction bids were premised on the assumption that FAC could, indeed, be sold." We need not decide whether there was a material issue of fact relating to the regulatory approval proposition because plaintiff does not rely in his argument on such a finding. Further, for purposes of our analysis of the partial disclosure issue, we have predicated our holding on the assumption most favorable to the defendants— namely that it is undisputed that the FAC bid was contingent and interdependent on the sale of the other parts of Bancorp, and that regulatory approval of a stand-alone sale of FAC would not have been forthcoming.</p>

That is, in merging with Bancorp, BoB absorbed the value of FAC. Thus, FAC’s net profit would be reflected in the value of shares held by post-Merger BoB stockholders. This Court has earlier held that stock<a id="p1282" href="#p1282" data-label="1282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1282</a>holders in certain situations are entitled to a control premium in a merger context where consummation of the proposed merger would effectively eliminate any expectation of such a premium in the future. <em>Paramount Communications, Inc. v.

The facts of this case did not entitle plaintiff to such a premium. <em>See infra </em>part VII (discussing plaintiff's <em>"Revlon </em>claim”). To the extent that plaintiff’s concern is that he will not realize profits stemming from FAC’s operations, as a post-Merger BoB stockholder, plaintiff has not lost such an opportunity. Nonetheless, the failure to disclose the FAC bid under these circumstances deprived plaintiff of the information necessary to make an informed choice of whether or not to support the Merger (which would place FAC as an asset in the merged entity) or to vote against the Merger and keep FAC as part of an independent Bancorp. Plaintiff was entitled to this choice whether or not the control premium is still available in the merged enterprise.</p>

Even disregarding Chase’s concerns as to the unreliability of the $19.26 figure, the Executive Summary and defendants’ other submissions consistently attest that the value was a mere estimate predicated on many uncertainties. Furthermore, the Court of Chancery does not appear to have relied on Chase's subjective opinion to conclude that the figure was immaterial. Rather, the trial court used Chase's skepticism as one basis among many for its finding that the $19.26 per share figure was unreliable.

This statement was made in the context of his discussion of the fairness of the Merger’s exchange ratio.

This finding is clearly erroneous because Connell made the statement in support of the May Proposal, not the Merger. The trial court's confusion may stem from defendants having assigned the name "Project Elite" to both the May Proposal and the Merger. Though the findings of the Court of Chancery appear somewhat flawed in this minor respect, it properly held that defendants did not breach their disclosure obligations with respect to the management projections.</p>
