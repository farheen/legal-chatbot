The games are usually held on Sundays and are open to members of the general public at prices ranging up to $45 per person. An individual prize of as large as $25,000 has been awarded in a single “Super Bingo” game. The weekly games draw many hundreds of players to the Pe-nobscot reservation from all over Maine and beyond. The games generate gross revenues of approximately $50,000 per month; the net profit is used to fund various tribal governmental services and programs, including snow and rubbish removal on the reservation, police and health services, and home improvement programs.</p>

The Nation argued that chapter 13-A of title 17 does not apply to it because it is neither a person, a firm, an association, nor a corporation. In support of this proposition, the tribe cited 30 M.R.S.A. § 6206(1) (Supp. 1982-1983), which states that the Penobscot Nation, “within [its] Indian territories, shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, privileges, powers and immunities ... and shall be subject to all the duties, obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality .... ” A municipality, the Nation pointed out, has been held not to be a “person” or a “corporation” — at least for purposes of a wrongful death statute, <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Town of Litchfield, </em><a href="/me/134/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="134 Me. 122" data-case-ids="8844216" data-case-paths="/me/134/0122-01">134 Me. 122</a>, 125, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20921" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="182 A. 921">182 A. 921</a>, 923 (1936); and it argued that one does not ordinarily think of a municipality as a “firm” or an “association.” The <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>Penobscot Nation further asserted that even if the beano law is, by its terms, applicable to it, the game is an “internal tribal matter,” which, under another provision of 30 M.R.S.A. § 6206(1), is “not subject to regulation by the State.” The Superior Court ruled against the Nation and denied its request for an injunction, holding that 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A applies to the Penobscot Nation and that it is not shielded by 30 M.R.S.A. § 6206(1) from state enforcement of the beano law.

In 1943, the legislature passed P.L.1943, ch. 355, “An Act Providing for the Licensing and Regulation of the Amusement Known as Beano.” Sections 1 and 7 of the 1943 act contained the precise “person, firm, association or corporation” language that now appears at 17 M.R.S.A. §§ 312 and 325. The original bill, L.D. 834 (91st Legis.1943), did not specify who or what could obtain a beano license; before it was passed, therefore, it was amended so as to limit licenses to fair associations and various nonprofit organizations. Speaking in favor of an early version of this amendment, Senator Brown of Aroostook said its effect would be to keep racketeers out of Maine because “no one but the bona fide organizations mentioned here can run a game of Beano in the state of Maine.” Legis.Rec. 1078 (1943).

The terms “person,” “firm,” “association,” and “corporation” were used to reach every entity capable of operating a beano game. The fundamental objective in interpreting any statute is to determine the intent of the legislature in enacting it and to give effect to that intent. <em>Cummings v.

    <p id="b531-9" data-blocks='[["BL_531.10",531,[953,1236,747,1499]]]'>Our interpretation of the language at issue in this case is reinforced by the fact that the general gambling laws in effect when the beano law was first adopted categorically prohibited all gambling, no matter by whom conducted. R.S. ch. 136, § 18 (1930), stated, “Every ... scheme or device of chance, of whatever name or description ... is prohibited,” and set penalties for “whoever is concerned therein.” R.S. ch. 136, § 1 (1930), levied a fine on “[w]hoever keeps or assists in keeping a gambling house,” while section 2 of the same chapter provided for a fine of up to twenty dollars for “[wjhoever gambles, or bets on any person gambling.” In short, the state of Maine in 1943 already prohibited gambling as a general matter; the legislature in that year acted to create a limited exception for certain specific entities eligible for beano licenses. If P.L. 1943, ch. 355, the direct precursor of current 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A, were read to allow some entity to conduct beano games without a license from the Chief of the State Police, it would directly conflict with the laws prohibiting gambling by all entities capable of engaging in gambling or “g'ames of chance.” We will not read a statute to conflict with another statute where an alternative, reasonable interpretation yields harmony. <em>See State v.

Moreover, the state’s criminal gambling laws, now codified at 17-A M.R.S.A. ch. 39, §§ 951-958 (1983), declare today, just as they did in 1943, that all beano games conducted without a license are illegal. Section 952(4) defines “gambling” so as to include beano, and, by section 952(11), any gambling “not expressly authorized by statute” is defined as “unlawful.” The only statute that could “authorize” a beano game is 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A; in fact, section 951 of the criminal code expressly exempts from the application of the rest of chapter 39 any person licensed by the Chief of the State Police under 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A. This explicit reference to the beano law indicates that the legislature in 1975 still considered it only a limited exception to the general no-gambling rule. <em>See </em>17-A M.R.S.A. § 951 comment.</p>

The Penobscot Nation cannot obtain permission to conduct its beano games under 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A or any other existing state statute. Therefore, even if it were to be considered a “municipality” for purposes of the beano law, it is prohibited by section 312 of title 17 from operating those games.</p>

The Nation argues that by dint of 30 M.R.S.A. § 6206(1), which gives the tribe authority over “internal tribal matters” free from state regulation, it retains all of the inherent powers that, according to federal law, are recognized as an attribute of an Indian tribe’s historical quasi-sovereignty. These powers, the Nation goes on to assert, include the right to raise money for tribal government and services by operating beano games on the Penobscot Indian Reservation, even though the games would otherwise be barred by state law. We cannot accept either of these two propositions. We conclude, first, that the Nation’s inherent sovereign powers would in any event not include the right to run a beano game in violation of state law, and, second, that the federal and state acts have independently defined the sphere within which the tribe can operate free of state regulation, and that beano cannot be considered an “internal tribal matter” within that narrow sphere.</p>

The Penobscot Nation, naturally, argues that its beano game functions to fulfill the same goal — to finance essential tribal services and programs. However, the Nation’s case is weaker than that of the Indians in the tax cases, for at least three reasons. First, the Penobseots’ beano revenues are not “derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the Tribe [where] the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services.” <em>Colville, </em><a href="/us/447/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="447 U.S. 134" data-case-ids="6182119" data-case-paths="/us/447/0134-01">447 U.S. at 156-57</a>, 100 S.Ct. at 2083. The Colville Indians were in a weaker position than the Jicarilla Apaches, in the eyes of the Court, because “the value marketed by the [Colvilles’] smokeshops to persons coming from outside is not generated on the reservation by activities in which the Tribes have a significant interest,” <a href="/us/447/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="447 U.S. 134" data-case-ids="6182119" data-case-paths="/us/447/0134-01">447 U.S. at 155</a>, 100 S.Ct. at 2082, whereas the taxpayers in <em>Jicarilla </em>both benefited from tribal services and depleted the natural resources of tribal land. Non-Indian beano players benefit from none of the services that the Penobseots’ beano revenues support. Nor do they, when buying beano tickets, “purchase” any Indian resource — such as the right to exploit tribal lands for mineral wealth.</p>

While a tax regulates or adds to the cost of some independent or underlying economic activity, a beano game is its own <em>raison d'etre. </em>Revenue-raising through beano is thus very different from revenue-raising through taxation. Beano is a commercial operation, related to tribal self-government only because of the use to which its profits are put. It shares with taxation none of the regulatory or user charge theories that have historically made taxation an intrinsically governmental function. If the Penobseots’ beano game is within their “sovereign” powers, then Indian tribes must have the inherent authority to enter into all spheres of activity from which a profit could be made: everything from selling dry goods to selling drugs could become an aspect of tribal self-government by the tribe’s committing the revenues raised to defraying the expense of the legitimate governmental function of the tribe.</p>

The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the interests of the state must be a part of the calculus where an Indian tribe’s “inherent” rights are under consideration. <em>Colville, </em><a href="/us/447/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="447 U.S. 134" data-case-ids="6182119" data-case-paths="/us/447/0134-01">447 U.S. at 156</a>, 100 S.Ct. at 2082-83. Maine has a legitimate governmental interest — having nothing to do with its own financial needs — in preventing the Penob-scot Nation’s beano games. The tribe’s interest in beano, by contrast, is purely financial. And in point of fact, the Penobseots would have nothing to “sell” if highstakes beano were not prohibited throughout the rest of Maine. The <em>Colville </em>Court allowed the State of Washington to apply its sales and cigarette taxes to on-reservation transactions because the Indian tribes had no inherent right “to market an exemption from state taxation.” <a href="/us/447/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="447 U.S. 134" data-case-ids="6182119" data-case-paths="/us/447/0134-01">447 U.S. at 155</a>, 100 S.Ct. at 2082.
