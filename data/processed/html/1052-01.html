Ackerman, Esq., and Ackerman’s now-dissolved law firm, Stien, Braunstein &amp; Associates, P.C. (SBA), negligently permitted the statute of limitations to expire without filing a workers’ compensation claim on Marboah’s behalf with the Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission. Marboah appeals from an order of the trial court awarding summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Because Marboah was an illegal alien — a fact that he fraudulently concealed from his employer, the Commission, the defendants, and the court — he was ineligible under then-current Virginia law to recover workers’ compensation. Accordingly, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the defendants were negligent in representing Marboah, he suffered no compensable loss as a result of their negligence, and he is not entitled to any recovery.</p>

Marboah intentionally and fraudulently concealed his ineligibility from his employer and from the workers’ compensation carrier by using the social security card and number of a man named Charles A. Boateng and by pretending that he was Boateng. In his deposition almost four years later, Marboah referred to Boateng as his “ghost identity.” Marboah maintained his masquerade for more than three years.</p>

Boateng. Believing that the injured person was in fact Boateng, the employer and the employer’s compensation carrier accepted the claim in that name and under Boateng’s social security number. Marboah could obtain benefits, however, only if the Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission remained unaware of two key facts: first, that the claimant, who purported to be Charles A. Boateng, was really an ineligible illegal alien named Marboah; and second, that Marboah had fraudulently concealed his true identity and his ineligibility from his employer and from the employer’s carrier. Furthermore, because exposure of the truth would have been fatal to Marboah’s claim and would have rendered him ineligible for compensation, Marboah felt compelled to adhere to his false story, so that his initial false statements snowballed with the passage of time. Marboah’s misrepresentations to the employer and to the carrier regarding his true identity and illegal status were followed by further lies to his original attorneys (defendants Ackerman and SBA), to his present counsel, to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and to the Superior Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Boateng at a social gathering. According to Marboah, Boateng had a valid work visa. Out of what Marboah supposed to be “remorse” for Marboah’s plight in being unable to work, Boateng gave Marboah his (Boateng’s) social security card so that Marboah could use it in order to find employment. Marboah testified at his deposition that he never saw Boateng again and did not know his whereabouts. In any event, before his visa had expired, Marboah contrived to use a false identity (that of Boateng) to secure employment, when he knew that worMng in the United States would contravene the terms of his visa. Moreover, contrary to a representation that he necessarily made to obtain his visa — namely, that he proposed to visit the United States for no more than ninety days — Marboah obviously intended to remain and work in this country indefinitely. Marboah was thus well aware that ninety days following his arrival he would become an illegal alien.</p>

On April 22, 1999, Marboah, continuing to hold himself out to be Charles A. Boateng, retained defendants Ackerman and SBA to represent “Boateng” in connection with “Boa-teng’s” claim for any compensation benefits to which he was entitled as a result of the accident that had occurred fifteen days earlier.

There is, however, a significant difference between the two cases with respect to the extent of the deception. The plaintiff in <em>Granados </em>acknowledged his forgery, as well as his status as an illegal alien, before the Commission. Marboah, on the other hand, continued his deception by misrepresenting his eligibility for compensation to the Commission, to the defendants, to his present counsel, and in his complaint and other papers filed in the Superior Court.</p>

Marboah’s deceptions, as we have seen, did not end with his attempt to have Acker-man present a fraudulent claim on his behalf. After Marboah and the defendants came to a parting of the ways,' Marboah secured new legal representation, again representing himself to be Boateng. In the complaint Marb-oah filed in the Superior Court as "Charles A. Boateng," he prayed that damages in the amount of five million dollars be awarded to "Charles A. Boateng,” thus fraudulently representing himself to the Superior Court as someone that he was not. Marboah also responded, under oath, as "Boateng,” to the defendants’ interrogatories. Thus, there can be no doubt that the deceptions that began in 1999, relating both to Marboah’s identity and to his ineligibility as an illegal alien to receive benefits, continued for almost four years thereafter, under oath, and in a judicial proceeding.</p>
      <p id="b1088-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1088.12",1088,[1049,1819,719,798]]]'>The very fact that Marboah brought a suit for $5,000,000 in the Superior Court and represented himself in the pleadings to be Charles A. Boateng suggests, at the very least, an unusual measure of audacity. Suppose that in the early stages of the litigation, before the plaintiff “Boateng” revealed his true identity, the defendants had made a $1,000,000 settlement offer and Marboah elected to accept it. Negotiation of the settlement check would have required Marboah to sign Boa-teng’s name on the check. A request to the defendants to make the check payable to an unknown Marboah, instead of to the ostensible plaintiff “Boateng,” would surely have raised an eyebrow or two on the defense side, and would perhaps have risked the collapse of the entire masquerade upon which Marboah’s complaint was based.</p>

Boateng,” not to Marboah, and they would not have been made at all but for Marboah’s concealment of his ineligibility for workers' compensation.</p>
