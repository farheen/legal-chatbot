    <p id="b1377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1377.5",1377,[169,485,746,669]]]'>Appellant, a member of the bar of the District of Columbia, appeared in the Superior Court as defense counsel in a jury trial which lasted from September 10th to September 13th, 1979. During the course of the trial, appellant was summarily adjudicated in criminal contempt, pursuant to Super.Ct.Cr.R. 42(a), on two occasions, both of which occurred in the actual presence of the court. Appellant contends that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions; (2) the trial judge erred in failing to recuse himself from the contempt proceeding; and (3) he was denied his right to a jury trial. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b1377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1377.6",1377,[167,1173,747,1040]]]'>Appellant represented a farmer who was charged with assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon pursuant to D.C. Code 1981, § 22-505(b) in the case of <em>United States v. Patrick K. Ryan, </em>Cr. No. F-1109-79. On February 25, 1979, Mr. Ryan was operating a tractor in a motorcade of over 200 tractors on Constitution Avenue. Officer William Clark of the Metropolitan Police Department observed him performing “wheelies” — quickly accelerating the tractor so as to cause its front wheels to rise off the ground. Officer Clark allegedly signaled Mr. Ryan to stop while standing in front of the tractor. Meanwhile, two other officers came to Officer Clark’s aid and approached from the side. Mr. Ryan stopped the vehicle. However, when one of the other officers climbed aboard and attempted to open the door of the cab, the tractor made a sudden move forward and struck Officer Clark. Mr. Ryan was arrested shortly thereafter.</p>
