Guy (“Respondent”). In No. 329, 1999 (Board Case Nos. 20 and 21, 1998), the Board found that Respondent had violated certain of the Delaware Lawyers Rules of Professional Conduct (the “DLRPC”) and recommended a sanction of a public reprimand. In No. 45, 2000 (Board Case Nos. 57, 69, and 90, 1996, 3 and 107, 1997), the Board also determined that Respondent had violated certain provisions of the DLRPC, but found him not in violation of certain others. The Board recommended a sanction of six months suspension.</p>

Respondent repeated those claims in argument before this Court, contending, in effect, that he has been discriminated against because of his race and singled out for disciplinary treatment different from that imposed upon other members of the Delaware Bar.</p>

The ODC contends that, in No. 45, 2000, the Board should have found Respondent to have violated certain additional disciplinary rules and that the Board’s recommendation of six months’ suspension is inadequate.</p>

After the presiding judge in the matter was made aware of the post-trial juror contacts, he held an office teleconference with counsel in the matter.

Hazard, Jr., <em>The Law of Lawyering </em>§ 3.5:401 at 660 (1999). The Court did, however, approve a report by the Board in another matter which found a violation of Rule 3.5(c) relating to a letter sent to a judge. <em>In re Guy, </em>Del .Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=670%20A.2d%201338" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="670 A.2d 1338">670 A.2d 1338</a> (1995). In any event, the Panel did not have to decide the issue, because there was clear and convincing evidence that the letter violated the requirements of Rule 8.2. In reaching this conclusion, the Panel specifically considered Respondent’s argument that his rights of free speech entitled him to make those remarks. The Panel concluded that Respondent’s status as a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware imposes upon him ethical obligations which limit his constitutional free speech rights when he is making statements in his capacity as a lawyer. <em>See e.g., Gentile v.

After his retention by Mr. Brown, Mr. Mitchell contacted Respondent on several occasions in order to obtain the client’s case file. Respondent was not responsive to Mr. Mitchell nor cooperative in turning over the file. Thereafter, Mr. Mitchell filed a disciplinary complaint with the ODC. As a result of the delays caused by Respondent’s failure to turn over the file and cooperate with new counsel, Mr. Mitchell was forced to request several continuances from the Court in order to submit post-trial motions. In addition, the presiding judge in Mr. Brown’s case entered an order indicating that the sentencing healing had to be rescheduled due to Respondent’s failure to share the case file with Mr. Brown’s new lawyer. The judge ordered Respondent to produce the case file no later than October 28, 1996 and specifically noted that if Respondent failed to produce the file in a timely manner, he would be sanctioned.

Having received no response to the first inquiry letter, on November 6, 1996, the ODC sent another letter to Respondent requesting his position on Mr. Mitchells’ complaint. Respondent delivered a response to the complaint on November 18, 1996, three days after the deadline for response. The ODC lawyers believed that Respondent’s November 18, 1996 response was not fully responsive to the initial inquiry letter and therefore sent an additional letter containing several specific questions in connection with the matter.

In the opinion, Judge Longobardi concluded that Respondent was “personally and fully responsible for a willful and consistent pattern of dilato-riness” and that Respondent’s conduct had “consumed resources that could have been much better spent on reaching the merits of this dispute.” The opinion also provided that Respondent’s “deliberate pattern of reckless disregard for the orders and rules of Court compels the ultimate sanction of dismissal.”</p>

    <p id="b918-3" data-blocks='[["BL_918.3",918,[235,243,722,1457]]]'>
      <a id="p884" href="#p884" data-label="884" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*884</a>First, the panel is of the view that the failure of the Respondent to interview witnesses identified by Mr. Gatewood, and to even inquire of those witnesses as to whether or not they possessed information which might be of use in Mr. Gatewood’s defense, was a violation of Rules 1.1 and 1.2(a). Although the Respondent provided a number of explanations at the hearing for his conclusion that the witnesses were not likely to have possessed useful information, the failure to even inquire of those witnesses about their knowledge unnecessarily risked the possibility that useful information might be lost. Conversely, negative information from the witnesses might also have been useful in advising Mr. Gatewood on whether to accept a plea. The Respondent may have been correct in his view that the purported witnesses did not possess useful information. However, only the inquiry— which had been specifically requested by his client — would have resolved the question. This problem was compounded by the fact that Mr. Gatewood had apparently been emphatic in requesting that the witnesses be contacted and interviewed.</p>
    <p id="b918-4" data-blocks='[["BL_918.4",918,[234,1721,718,776]]]'>Secondly, the [panel] is of the view that the Respondent’s failure to communicate with Mr. Gatewood with respect to his appeal, or to file a timely appeal, was in violation of Rule 1.3 and Rule 1.4(a). Mr. Gatewood had every right to expect that he would be promptly contacted by his attorney for purposes of preparing an appeal. When that did not happen, Mr. Gatewood attempted to act on his own behalf. The circumstances described by Mr. Gatewood in this context were inconsistent with Respondent’s duty of diligence as well as the duty to keep the client reasonably informed.</p>

The panel is of the view that the attitude expressed by the Respondent, can, at best, be characterized as uncooperative. This was not inconsistent with his failure to participate in the June 3 hearing or to file an answering brief as requested by the panel. Similarly, the refusal of the Respondent to respond to the directive of the Supreme Court’s assistant clerk that he acknowledge the continuing obligation to represent Mr. Gatewood by a specified date would appear to violate Rule 3.4(c).</p>
    <p id="b918-7" data-blocks='[["BL_918.7",918,[1038,902,713,689]]]'>The panel is of the view that the balance of the allegations in the petition in Board Case No. 20 fail for lack of proof. For example, the panel is not satisfied, based upon the Respondent’s testimony or the testimony of Mr. Gate-wood, that Mr. Gatewood was unaware of his potential sentencing exposure if he went to trial. The Respondent testified that he told Mr. Gatewood what he was facing, and the panel was not satisfied, for purposes of this disciplinary proceeding, that Mr. Gatewood’s testimony to the contrary was persuasive.</p>

Confusion apparently arose, however, with respect to statements made by opposing counsel as to whether or not Respondent was still practicing criminal law. Although, failure to actually appear at the hearing was improper, the panel was not satisfied that this one incident rose to the level of a disciplinary rule violation, particularly in light of the fact that it did not result in any prejudice under the circumstances to Mr. Gatewood.</p>

Mr. Burton further attempted to contact the Respondent by leaving notes on the door of his residence. Mr. Burton began waiting for the Respondent, a member of the City Council, during City Council meetings. After a wait as long as three hours, the Respondent hurriedly acknowledged Mr. Burton, promised to get in touch with him, and then failed to do so.

    <p id="b921-6" data-blocks='[["BL_921.5",921,[188,1195,754,838]]]'>In fixing an appropriate sanction, the Board, or ultimately this Court, must bear in mind that the primary purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public as well as to foster public confidence in the Bar. Equally deserving of consideration is the preservation of the integrity of the profession and deterrence of similar misconduct by other members of the profession. <em>See In re Agostini </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/632/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="632 A.2d 80" data-case-ids="7361582" data-case-paths="/a2d/632/0080-01">632 A.2d 80</a>, 81 (1993). In the imposition of lawyer discipline, this Court should consider the range of sanctions imposed in comparable instances of lawyer misconduct and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, particularly the lawyer’s disciplinary record.</p>

In May 1994, he was publicly reprimanded for failure to appear in the Family Court and being found in criminal contempt for his conduct in a Superior Court trial. In November 1994, Respondent was again publicly reprimanded for failure to respond to ODC requests for information, conduct which the Board found was part of a pattern of unresponsiveness. In September 1995, Respondent received his third public reprimand for a discourteous communication to the Chief Justice, attacking the integrity of this Court. In addition to his public reprimands, the Respondent has received two private admonitions, one in 1993 and another in 1995.</p>
    <p id="b921-13" data-blocks='[["BL_921.13",921,[987,944,757,584]]]'>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Respondent’s disciplinary experience has been his unwillingness to acknowledge any responsibility for his actions. It has been his contention that his disciplinary problems are the result of a racially biased system, not his own conduct. To the extent that remorse or acknowledgment of wrongdoing is a mitigating factor in the assessment of sanctions, Respondent’s attitude gives little hope for a change in behavior.</p>

      <em>McCann </em>is particularly instructive when compared with the present case. In <em>McCann, </em>this Court noted as aggravating factors the respondent’s previous sanctions and “multiple violations on this record.” Despite the mitigating factors of medical problems, efforts to rectify the consequences of his misconduct, his remorse and cooperation with the ODC, the <em>McCann </em>Court nonetheless imposed a one-year suspension. While <em>McCann </em>involved an element of dishonesty that is lacking in this case, Respondent’s complete lack of appreciation for the need to conform his conduct with that expected of all other members of the Delaware Bar renders his situation equally aggravating.</p>
    <p id="b922-5" data-blocks='[["BL_922.5",922,[202,1249,756,1174]]]'>We are also concerned about Respondent’s lack of timely responses to written inquiries from the ODC. It appears that the ODC has been required to use certified mail with return receipts requested to established notice to Respondent, despite the requirement that each member of the Bar, as part of the annual registration statement under Rule 69(b), designate both a residence and office address. The purpose of this provision, and one further requirement under Rule 9(g) that a lawyer notify the Clerk of this Court within 80 days of any change in the registration information, is to afford public notice of addresses at which a lawyer may receive communication from, among others, the regulatory arms of this Court. Respondent’s multiple violations of Rule 8.1 show a pattern of delayed and non-responsive replies to inquiries from the ODC, resulting, in large part, from his failure to reply to mail sent to him at the address listed on his registration form.</p>
