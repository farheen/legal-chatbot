Sonny and the defendant, Norma Small (fik/a Norma Grotton), had been married for twenty-six years.</p>
    <p id="b473-7" data-blocks='[["BL_473.10",473,[107,1705,751,415]]]'>[¶ 3] In the early 1980s, Sonny, an enlisted naval serviceman, was assigned to a base in Newport, Rhode Island, where he worked as a machinist-mate instructor until his death. Sonny lived and worked in Rhode Island during the week and returned to the family’s Belfast home at the same time every Friday evening.</p>

Shortly after Smith moved into the house, Small began telling Smith that she wanted somebody to kill her husband.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In early 1983, after “quite a few” preliminary conversations, Small offered to pay Smith $10,000 if he would kill Sonny.</p>
    <p id="b473-16" data-blocks='[["BL_473.15",473,[906,814,754,768]]]'>[¶ 5] Smith considered the proposition and decided to conduct a “dry run” of the execution to determine if the murder would be possible. One night, in February 1983, he hid behind the house and watched Sonny return from work. After simulating the murder, however, Smith informed Small that he would be unable to accomplish the plan. Small was “angry” and repeatedly demanded that Smith find another person to commit the murder. Smith ultimately succumbed to Small’s requests and, a few weeks after performing the “dry run,” he agreed to help Small find another triggerman.</p>

After the meeting, Smith told Small that Fuller would contact her directly, and he testified that he had no further discussions with either Small or Fuller regarding the mur<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>der plot.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Karen Reed, Fuller’s cousin, and an acquaintance of Small in the late 1970s and early 1980s, testified that she saw Fuller at Small’s house two or three times before Sonny’s death.</p>

Between 7:30 and 8:00 P.M., a loud bang was heard coming from outside the house. Sonny was found lying in the driveway bleeding profusely. Emergency medical technicians transported Sonny to Waldo County Hospital where he was pronounced dead later that evening. Sonny died from gunshot wounds to the face and trunk region.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[183,1255,753,663]]]'>[¶ 8] Law enforcement personnel arrived at the scene between 8:80 and 9:00 P.M., secured the location, and began searching for physical evidence. Investigators discovered two spent 30/30 rifle casings between two woodpiles located in the Grot-ton’s backyard. The casings were found approximately thirty to forty feet from the spot where Sonny fell after being shot. The investigators did not find any other physical evidence that evening. An autopsy performed the next day indicated that three bullets hit Sonny.</p>

As the vehicle approached the intersection of Back Belfast Road and Route 173, Fuller told Phillips that a 30/30 rifle was located by a brook on the right-hand side of the intersection. Phillips, a gun collector, decided not to look for the rifle, however, because Fuller informed him that it was severely damaged when he “smashed it against a telephone pole.”</p>
    <p id="b474-10" data-blocks='[["BL_474.11",474,[985,392,750,494]]]'>[¶ 10] Later that day, as the two continued driving, Fuller told Phillips that he “was paid to shoot some guy. on White Street.” He said that the victim was in the service; that he waited behind a woodpile for him to get home; that he first shot the man in the back as he reached for the door; and that he then shot the victim in the head as he attempted to cover his face with his hand.</p>
    <p id="b474-11" data-blocks='[["BL_474.12",474,[985,917,750,1062]]]'>[¶ 11] In May of 1985, Lloyd Bryant found a damaged lever-action rifle while fishing with his brothers in a river near the intersection on Route 173 where Fuller had previously told Phillips he could find a damaged 30/30 rifle. The rifle was turned over to the State Police where it was analyzed and later identified as a lever-action 30/30 caliber Winchester rifle. The State Police asked a firearms and tool-mark examiner to assess the rifle’s connection to the Sonny Grotton homicide. The firearms examiner test-fired the weapon and compared the resulting test cartridge casings to those recovered near the woodpile at the crime scene. He, however, could not make a proper identification of the test cartridges and, thus, could not make a determination of whether the shell casings found at the crime scene were fired from the 30/30 rifle found by Lloyd Bryant.</p>

Pursuant to the plan, a special agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service posed as one of Fuller’s jailhouse acquaintances, ostensibly sent by Fuller to ask Small who had been <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>cooperating with the police. Small told the agent to tell Fuller that she was not the snitch, that she “expect[ed] the same,” and to “sit tight.”</p>

During the interview, Small admitted asking Smith to kill Sonny for $10,000. She maintained, however, that she later changed her mind, but could not find Smith to stop him. She also denied meeting Fuller and expressed her belief that Smith was the triggerman.</p>

Small objected on hearsay grounds, and the State proffered that the testimony was admissible as “statements against interest” pursuant to M.R. Evid. 804(b)(3).</p>
