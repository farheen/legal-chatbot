The difficulty with <em>Hubbard </em>is that most of supporting decisions referenced by the <em>Hubbard </em>Court expressed (or at least allowed for) necessary exceptions to the issue-preservation requirement, including “where petitioner is represented on appeal by new counsel, but the grounds upon which the claim of ineffective assistance are based do not appear in the trial record.” <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Hubbard, </em>however, neglected to account, in any way, for the flexibility afforded by the <em>Dancer </em>exceptions.
