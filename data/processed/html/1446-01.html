The divorce agreement provided that the couple would share joint legal and physical custody of their only child, McKenzie. In September 1996, Christine unexpectedly received a job offer in Dallas, Texas. Believing that this Dallas job would enhance her career and that life in a small suburb of Dallas would offer better opportunities for her and for McKenzie, she asked Stephen for permission to move to Dallas with McKenzie; Stephen denied this request. On October 22, Christine filed a motion to relocate with the district court, and Stephen filed an opposition motion in which he requested that the court grant him primary custody of McKenzie. Christine filed a reply motion on February 7, 1997.</p>

In fact, Christine testified that she seeks to encourage visitation and believes that Stephen is a good father. Regarding the last <em>Schwartz </em>factor, Christine states that while weekly visitation will be impractical given that the parties cannot afford weekly airline tickets, McKenzie and Stephen can visit each other regularly with less frequent but longer visits, instead of more frequent shorter visits.</p>

NRS 125A.350 is primarily a notice statute intended to prevent one parent from in effect “stealing” the children away from the other parent by moving them away to another state and attempting to sever contact. Given the legislative purpose behind NRS 125A.350, it should not be used to prevent the custodial parent from freely pursuing a life outside of Nevada when reasonable alternative visitation is possible.</blockquote>

The motion by the father to change the custody arrangement was made in response to the motion to relocate.

    <p id="b604-7" data-blocks='[["BL_604.8",604,[219,788,1131,496]]]'>This is an appeal from a custody decision granting Stephen Blaich’s motion to change custody of his child from joint custody to primary custody. Upon the court’s granting Blaich’s motion, Blaich, the father, became the primary custodian of the child. As I see it, the district court’s refusal to permit the mother to take the child away from the primary custodian to be with her in Texas is merely an incident of the custody decision. NRS 125A.350 relates only to <em>primaiy </em>and joint custodians. Since the mother does not have primary custody, she does not have standing to proceed under NRS 125A.350. Consequently, the district court did not err in denying the mother’s motion to remove the child.</p>
    <p id="b604-8" data-blocks='[["BL_604.9",604,[212,1288,1134,678]]]'>The majority opinion is wrong when it asserts that the district court evaluated the mother’s motion to relocate “under the false assumption that it must first determine whether to grant Christine primary physical custody.” The district court made no “false assumption.” As I explain in McGuinness v. McGuinness, <a href="/nev/114-2/1431-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="114 Nev. 1431" data-case-ids="11497555" data-case-paths="/nev/114-2/1431-01">114 Nev. 1431</a>, <a href="/nev/114-2/1431-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="114 Nev. 1431" data-case-ids="11497555" data-case-paths="/nev/114-2/1431-01">970 P.2d 1074</a> (1998) (Springer, C. J., dissenting), a joint custodian who seeks to remove a child to another state is seeking a change in custody to primary custodian status. Thus, the district court in this case was deciding the issue that was truly before it in this case — if joint custody was no longer an option, who was to be the primary custodian? I see nothing in the record that would prevent the court from granting the father’s motion for primary custody. Thé majority opinion holds that “the district court failed to apply the correct law.” I think that it is this court that has failed to apply the correct law; therefore, I dissent.</p>
