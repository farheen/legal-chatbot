One year later, Claimant discharged first counsel and hired second counsel. Claimant entered into an agreement of representation with second counsel in which counsel would receive 20% of claimant’s benefits. Following second counsel’s entry into the case, employer challenged claimant’s entitlement to benefits, which second counsel successfully defended. Second counsel filed a Petition for Approval of Attorney’s Fees <em>with the Board, </em>requesting the Board approve the petition pursuant to Sections 442 and 501 of the Act. First counsel filed an answer with the Board objecting to second counsel’s request.</p>

First counsel appealed to the Board, which reversed the WCJ, concluding that, per <em>Long, </em>the WCJ and Board were without jurisdiction to apportion attorney’s fees. Second counsel appealed and this Court affirmed the Board. In reaching this decision, we relied on <em>McEachin </em>and applied its rationale. We noted that a dispute between two attorneys over the fee is not within the ambit of the WCJ because the first attorney is not representing the client’s interests, but is solely representing his own interests.</p>
      <p id="b511-10" data-blocks='[["BL_511.11",511,[999,1610,722,840]]]'>We find this case distinguishable. First, the Court in <em>Tokish </em>did not address the <em>White </em>decision. It relied on <em>McEachin </em>and then also noted that <em>Long </em>reaffirmed the <em>McEachin </em>holding. Reliance on Judge Doyle’s <em>McEach-in </em>opinion, without also considering his <em>White </em>opinion, presents an incomplete statement of the law. Arguably, the analysis in <em>White </em>tacitly limits the <em>McEachin </em>holding and, in doing so, seems to implicitly accept some of the points raised by Judge Friedman in her well-reasoned dissenting opinion in <em>McEachin. </em>The <em>Long </em>case, while not specifically referencing the <em>White </em>case, is consistent with both <em>McEachin </em>and <em>White, </em>and seems to travel down the same path from <em>McEachin </em>blazed by <em>White </em>— that the operative fact in such cases is whether the fee petition had been filed with the WCJ <em>prior </em>to counsel's cessation of representation.</p>

Since both present and prior attorneys would receive 20% of claimant's benefits, claimant would be in the same position regardless of which attorney was entitled to the fees. In that sense, the dispute between attorneys in <em>Tokish </em>was more like a separate cause of action from the initial workers' compensation claim.</p>

Since one attorney, Sager, would receive 20% and the other; Silver, would receive 15% of Claimant’s benefits, Claimant is obviously affected by which attorney is entitled to the fees. As Claimant has a more direct interest in this case, the dispute between attorneys is not a separate cause of action as it was in <em>Tokish </em>but, rather, is one closely linked with the initial workers' compensation claim.</p>

The question of standing formed a large part of our analysis in the <em>McEachin </em>and <em>White </em>cases. As in <em>White </em>and <em>Long, </em>because Sager previously filed a fee agreement with the WCJ, which had been approved, these circumstances provide him with standing to seek further review with the WCJ of the WCJ’s previous order.

We also reject Silver’s argument that Sager's appeal should have been dismissed for failing to conform to the Board’s regulations regarding content and form of appeal. Silver describes Sager’s nunc pro tunc appeal for reinstatement of counsel fees as a "bizarre document,” in that this document was not in the proper format for an appeal to the Board. Silver also avers that, per <em>Jonathan Sheppard Stables v.

More specifically, Silver notes that, while Section 111.11(a) of the Board’s regulations, 34 Pa.Code § 111.11(a), requires the appeal to be on a form provided by the Board, Sager's appeal was not on such a form. Additionally, Silver notes that Sager's appeal failed to: (1) specify the circulation date of the decision at issue as required by Section 111.11(a)(1); (2) specify the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the appeal was based as required by Section 111.11(a)(2); (3) include a copy of the WCJ's decision as required by Section 111.11(a)(5); and (4) contain a proof of service as required by Section 111.11 (a)(6).</p>

Importantly, we also relied on the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 1551(a), which provides that "[n]o question shall be heard or considered by the court which was not raised before the government unit....” The key is that the issue is raised, at the appropriate time, with appropriate sufficiency to preserve the issue before the Board.</p>

As he was not a party to the WCJ decision, Sager could not appeal from that decision.
