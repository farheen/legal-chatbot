The factual allegations were as.follows: Decedent was falsely arrested by City police officers on November 5, 1987, and was taken to a local police station and then to the Police Administration Building in Philadelphia. Decedent was a diabetic in need of continuous medical care. She was wearing a medical alert bracelet indicating this condition and that information was noted in the police log book. While she was in custody, she became ill, but no medical care was provided. Shortly after being released, she died from insulin shock. The City denied that Decedent made them aware of her diabetic condition or that she was ill while she was in custody. The City also raised immunity under what is known as the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8541-8564.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

First of all, a negligence claim is brought under the state common law, while a Section 1983 claim is a federal cause of action created by Congress pursuant to direct authorization contained in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment investing Congress “with the power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment with appropriate legislation.” A different governmental entity created the Section 1983 claim than the one which allowed common law remedies, and for different reasons — one to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and one to compensate individuals for harm done by the negligence of others. Consequently, a different measure of proof is required in a negligence action as opposed to a Section 1983 action. An ordinary negligence action requires a showing that the plaintiff was damaged by the defendant’s breach of a duty of ordinary care. Although we have previously decided that just because a plaintiff has not specifically set forth the statute by stating a “Section 1983” cause of action does not mean the claim cannot be pursued; to maintain such an action, a plaintiff is required to allege first that a person or persons deprived him of some cognizable federal right, privilege or immunity, and second, that the person or persons deprived him of that right while acting under the color of state law. <em>Heinly v.
