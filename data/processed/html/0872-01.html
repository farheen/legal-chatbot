Approval of the license is “conditioned upon the licensee’s compliance with the terms of the written agreement.” 23 DCMR § 1513.3.

Moreover, in its final public hearing before approving the agreement, the Board unequivocally informed both Samdo and NLPNA that, if the agreement were violated, the license could be “suspended or revoked” at the Board’s discretion.

Both parties stated at the last hearing where the agreement was discussed that they understood and agreed to its terms. Samdo was represented by two attorneys during this process and, although Samdo now suggests that difficulties in understanding the English language may have hindered the Ohs’ understanding of the agreement, there is no evidence in the record supporting that claim.

With respect to the first remaining issue, the Board concluded that the store did not detract from the cultural and economic vitality of the neighborhood. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered, among other things, expert testimony that: (1) real property values had increased in the neighborhood; (2) the store was convenient for senior and retired citizens living in the surrounding area; (3) the owner made contributions for the past six years to local churches and others in the community; and (4) declining market values in the area were due to the recession and not to the operation of the store. The Board also considered the Mr. Oh’s violations of the Agreement and that he admitted his wrong and was sanctioned for it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> However, it deemed the infractions insufficient to withhold license renewal, considering the other pertinent factors.</p>
