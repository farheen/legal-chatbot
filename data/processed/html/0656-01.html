The terms of transfer of the stock reflect the competing considerations of the parties. Concerned that the purchase might not produce the expected results, DAI wanted to retain some of the stock until the expected revenues were actually received from operations; Norton, however, wanted an immediate transfer of all stock so that his holding period under Federal security regulations (for “investment letter stock”) could begin at settlement and so that the tax impact of the transfer would be minimized under § 368(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

Here, the certificate was filled in with Norton’s name but that alone does not create legal ownership in him. As the Chancellor said in Smith v.

The ultimate question in <em>Smith </em>was quite different but the analysis as to delivery is pertinent. Delivery, actual or constructive, is required to complete the transfer of the shares. 1 Christy Transfer of Stock § 12. And the rule is the same if the parties utilized an escrow arrangement. Compare Paul v.

    <p id="b695-9" data-blocks='[["BL_695.9",695,[962,216,749,229]]]'>In its narrowest sense the question now before the Court is whether delivery of the stock (or stock certificates) into escrow was a delivery to Norton for voting purposes, I conclude that it was not.</p>
    <p id="b695-10" data-blocks='[["BL_695.10",695,[962,501,752,1714]]]'>The agreement quite plainly provides that delivery into escrow is nothing more than that. Thus paragraph 2(e) states that shares “when issued and delivered as herein provided, will be validly issued and outstanding shares” of DAI. Certainly that means, not a mere transfer to the escrow agent but a delivery under the earn-out provision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> Paragraph 4 states that “On the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, DAI will issue and deliver” certificates to Norton but they are “distributable as set forth” in the formula referred to above (one share for each $2.-66 of net profit, etc.). Paragraph 12(b) (iii) of the contract is to the same effect. These mean, as I read them, that two steps are contemplated: first, “issue” of the shares by DAI which was completed when the certificates were titled in Norton’s name and turned over to the Bank of Texas; second, “delivery” of the shares “as herein provided” is required and, since the Bank holds them upon completion of the first step, this can only mean a delivery by it to Norton and that is to take place as provided “herein”; and that necessarily involves the earn-out formula. In short, the total arrangement is tri-partite, as DAI argues and contemplates successive steps: (1) preparation of certificates in Norton’s name, followed by (2) physical transfer of them to the Bank of Texas and then, (3) delivery to Norton. The contract states when each step is to be taken.</p>
    <p id="b696-3" data-blocks='[["BL_696.3",696,[202,223,749,375]]]'>
      <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>It follows that legal ownership of the shares does not pass to Norton until they are delivered to him by the Bank out of escrow and until he is the owner he has no right to exercise an incident of ownership, <em>vis </em>voting. And Norton has not shown any right to vote the shares independent of legal ownership.</p>
    <p id="b696-4" data-blocks='[["BL_696.4",696,[196,636,754,859]]]'>My conclusion with respect to delivery is supported, I believe, by the purpose of the escrow. Beyond doubt it was created for two reasons: first, to assure performance by DAI (release of the shares to Norton) as the conditions of the contract were met; and, second, to give Norton an opportunity to establish an early date for the holding period required under Federal security regulations. Neither of those considerations bears directly upon the right to vote and I conclude that neither of them was, in fact, intended by the parties to have any relationship to the right to vote. In short, the escrow served purposes <em>other </em>than voting and I am unable to infer from its existence that the parties intended it to confer voting rights on Norton.</p>
    <p id="b696-5" data-blocks='[["BL_696.5",696,[194,1524,751,714]]]'>Norton’s argument based upon delivery to the Bank as his agent under the Uniform Commercial Code, 5A Del.C. § 8-313(1)(a) is without merit; the Bank serves both parties under the agreement and cannot release the shares until the conditions are met. As to Norton’s argument that certain filings by DAI with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that it considered the escrow stock as issued, this is not persuasive. Assuming that the stock was so considered for record or filing purposes, it does not necessarily follow that Norton had delivery rights to it or voting rights in it.</p>
    <p id="b696-6" data-blocks='[["BL_696.6",696,[191,2267,752,424]],["BL_696.7",696,[1003,222,748,375]]]'>It should also be pointed out that Norton may never receive some of the escrowed shares in which he now claims voting rights. As indicated above, he is entitled to receive those shares only under the earn-out formula and any shares not delivered to him within eighteen months are to be returned from escrow to DAI. It is unrealistic to say that the parties intended that Norton should have the right to vote shares under these circumstances, particularly with their obvious impact on corporate control. At the time of the agreement DAI had only 853,155 shares outstanding. I cannot conclude that the parties agreed that Norton would have right to vote shares which he might never own.</p>
