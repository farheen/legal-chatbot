More specifically, under the “omnibus clause” of that policy, the question becomes whether Smith was at the time of the accident using the Augusta News vehicle with the permission of Augusta News. On USF &amp; G’s motion for summary judgment, the Superior Court (Kennebec County) held that the record then before it failed to generate any genuine issue on that factual question; that there was nothing in that record that would justify a finding that Smith had permission to use the Augusta News vehicle. On plaintiffs’ appeal, we affirm the summary judgment entered in favor of USF &amp; G.</p>

    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[203,324,750,325]]]'>In September 1980 Dale Smith, then 20 years of age, was living with his cousin Karen James and her husband in the Purgatory area of Litchfield. Mr. James had been employed by Augusta News Company for several years and at that time served as the manager of its warehouse in Augusta.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[203,671,752,1421]]]'>For some time up to September 26, 1980, Mr. James with Augusta News’s permission had been using an Oldsmobile station wagon owned by the company to go to and from work. On the evening of September 26, 1980, while Mr. and Mrs. James were out, Smith was joined at the James residence by a group of young friends. After drinking wine and whiskey with his visitors, Smith took the company Oldsmobile, without Mr. James’s knowledge or permission, and set off for Gardiner with his friends to get pizza and beer. Challenged to show off the power of the Oldsmobile, Smith drove at a high rate of speed and lost control of the vehicle. In the crash that followed, one of Smith’s passengers was killed and the rest were injured. Richard Taylor, the personal representative of the deceased passenger, and Brenda and Betty Taylor, two of the injured passengers, sued Smith for damages arising out of the crash and recovered default judgments against him. Those same plaintiffs now seek to satisfy those default judgments through the present reach-and-apply action against USF &amp; G, the issuer of the insurance policy held by Augusta News on its Oldsmobile driven by Smith on the fatal evening.</p>

In addition to the named insured, Augusta News, the policy in its omnibus clause declared that “[ajnyone else is an <em>insured </em>while using with <em>your </em>[i.e., Augusta News’s] permission a covered <em>auto you </em>own” (emphasis in original), subject to certain specified exceptions not applicable here. On USF &amp; G’s motion for summary judgment, the Superior Court had before it the deposition testimony of Mr. James, Dale Smith, and Mr. Kunitz, one of the owners of Augusta News, as well as answers to interrogatories by defendant USF &amp; G. The Superior Court concluded that, on the determinative fact question whether Smith at the time of the accident was using the Oldsmobile with Augusta News’ permission, the record did not raise any genuine issue. It held that nothing whatever in the evidence presented by either party lent support to the existence of any such permission, express or implied. Our examination of the record materials appropriately considered under M.R.Civ.P. 56(c) leaves us with no reason to disagree with the Superi- or Court’s conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b229-9" data-blocks='[["BL_229.9",229,[1006,1187,750,754]]]'>That Smith never received explicit permission directly or indirectly from Augusta News to use the car is undisputed. Therefore, Smith could be an insured under the policy only if, as plaintiffs argue, the scope of permitted use granted Mr. James by Augusta News by implication included operation of the vehicle by Smith, as a member of Mr. James’s household, for Smith’s own purposes. We agree with the Superior Court’s finding that the record demonstrated beyond any genuine dispute that the scope of any permission that Augusta News granted Mr. James was not broad enough to encompass the use to which Smith put the Oldsmobile.</p>
    <p id="b229-10" data-blocks='[["BL_229.10",229,[1005,1961,750,706]],["BL_230.1",230,[217,273,758,1038]]]'>In his deposition Mr. Kunitz did testify that his company allowed employees to use company vehicles outside of working hours for two purposes: to make deliveries and pickups for Augusta News at stops on or near an employee’s commuting route and to provide a means of transportation to and from work when an employee had no other way to commute. When the company permitted one of its vehicles to be used for the latter purpose, it arguably gave the employee implied permission to use the vehicle for essential personal errands (such as grocery shopping) because it knew that the employee had no other means of taking <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>care of those essential needs. Mr. Kunitz’s testimony, however, would at most support a finding that Augusta News had impliedly authorized its employee to use the company car to take care of those essential needs of that employee. At the same time, all evidence in the record, without exception, contradicts any implication that Augusta News authorized a member of an employee’s household to use the vehicle for that third person’s social purposes. Thus, on the record submitted to the Superior Court on the motion for summary judgment, we agree with its holding that there is no dispute that Smith’s use of the Oldsmobile “was a substantial deviation from the permitted use both as to purpose and place of operation.” <em>Savage v.

A close look at <em>Lyons, </em>however, dispels any notion that it is precedent for declaring Smith an insured on the USF &amp; G policy. <em>Lyons </em>stands for the proposition that the “use” to which a vehicle is put rather than the identity of the operator is the dispositive factor in determining whether an operator is an additional insured under an omnibus clause like the one in the case at bar.</p>

In <em>Lyons </em>the son of the named insured used the car within the scope of his permission to do so, although he violated the named insured’s orders by allowing a friend to operate the car in which he rode as a passenger.

Because the employee had an accident while he was taking his aunt shopping — a use not within the scope of permission granted by the owner — he was not an insured under the owner’s policy.
