Following a jury-waived trial, the judge found mostly in favor of the tenants on their claims for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, interference with quiet enjoyment, failure to supply hot water, violation of the security deposit statute, violation of G.L.c. 93A, and breach of contract, but for Zhao on their claim of retaliation. Two appeals followed. The first (No. 12-ADMS-40001) by the tenants, concerned only the finding in favor of Zhao on the retaliation claim. The second appeal (No. 12-<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>ADMS-40007), by Zhao, claimed various errors in the trial judge’s findings for the tenants, except on their claim for breach of contract,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">5</a> including an award to them of attorney’s fees. We affirm the decision of the trial judge except as to a duplicative award of damages, which we vacate, his finding in favor of Zhao on the retaliation claim, and his attorney’s fee award. We return the action to Quincy District Court for further findings on the last two issues.</p>
    <p id="b66-3" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[143,598,1358,312]]]'>The tenants entered into a one-year lease with Zhao for an apartment in Quincy. The tenancy, which actually began on July 27, 2009, was supposed to run from August 1, 2009 through July 31, 2010, with a monthly rent of $1,600.00. Real estate listings stated that there were two parking spaces for the apartment, and that pets were not allowed. The tenants disclosed to listing real estate agents that they had three aquaria, which contained either fish or otherwise undescribed reptiles and amphibians, and expressed concerns about the limited available parking.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[145,917,1357,84]]]'>Zhao was aware of the aquaria from the beginning of the tenancy, and also knew that the tenants were parking on the property.</p>

They had also reported a hot water problem by telephone, but informed Zhao he could ignore that call since the problem had been rectified. There followed in August a complaint by the tenants about the window of a downstairs door and another about electrical power disruption because of a problem with two outlets. In a September e-mail, Zhao recognized electrical problems, and some work was performed later that month.</p>

Zhao responded that a flood light had been installed in the back door area and that he would address the hot water and lock issues.</p>
    <p id="b66-8" data-blocks='[["BL_66.9",66,[141,1647,1359,400]]]'>In February, Mathew, although he did not seek medical attention, was shocked when using an electrical outlet. The tenants complained that outlets were not properly grounded, and demanded immediate attention. Zhao advised them that he had engaged an electrician, but asked them to cover any questionable outlets with tape. He suggested to the tenants that it was their “responsibility to safeguard this place” and that they were free to find another place to live. At the tenants’ request, Quincy authorities inspected the apartment and found an insufficient hot water supply, a faulty shower door, a loose rear door lock, and loose Plexiglas in the main front door. Additionally, a Quincy inspector found that two electrical outlets were deficient.</p>

The tenants withheld March rent. On March 2, 2010, Zhao notified the tenants by e-mail that they had broken the lease by keeping animals and by parking in the backyard; he warned them to remove the animals immediately and refrain from parking on the property. In a March 4 e-mail, Zhao <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>stated, “as for pet and parking, I’ll let my friends have it, but now I don’t have the reason to do it.” Noting a black Subaru parked on the property on March 11, Zhao emailed the tenants that “it is not the one I usually see. It is not yours, I’ll get it towed now; and if it is yours, please be advised that you are not allowed to park any car in my property.” Zhao took no action, however, as to that car or the aquaria.</p>
    <p id="b67-3" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[137,556,1356,357]]]'>Although the tenants signaled that they would pay the withheld March rent when repairs were effected, which occurred on March 11, 2010, they did not do so. On March 8, they had sent a G.L.c. 93A demand letter to Zhao, who made a written tender of settlement on March 18. Further negotiations ensued, until a letter of March 26 from the tenants’ counsel indicated that the letter was “to confirm” the parties’ agreement. The letter mentioned the moving-out date and the return of the security deposit, but was silent as to the rent for March. It also referred to preparing mutual releases. Neither a settlement agreement nor releases were executed.</p>

Zhao’s answer contained a counterclaim alleging breach of contract.</p>

In April, 2011, Zhao moved for summary judgment on the ground that the parties had entered into a binding settlement agreement. That motion was denied, and a trial followed. The trial judge awarded the tenants $1,880.00 on their claim for breach of the warranty of habitability, and $1,600.00 on the claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which he trebled to $4,800.00. The judge also found for the tenants on their security deposit claim, assessing damages in the amount of $4,800.00 plus interest, and on their G.L.c. 93A claim, for which he awarded the tenants single damages of $1,880.00. The judge further found that recovery on the tenants’ claim alleging failure to supply hot water would be duplicative of the award for breach of the warranty of habitability. The judge found for Zhao on the tenants’ retaliation and breach of contract claims, but for the tenants on Zhao’s breach of contract counterclaim.</p>
    <p id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.7",67,[137,1748,1356,173]]]'>Zhao appealed, and a few days later the tenants moved for an award of attorney’s fees.

Zhao had given the tenants a letter advising that their security deposit had been “deposited in an E*Trade account with account number ending 8300.” Zhao points out that E*Trade is a federally chartered savings bank, G.L.c. 167D, §32, with a location within the Commonwealth, specifically at 60 State Street, Boston. Additionally, the fact that the deposit receipt that Zhao provided the tenants identified only the last four digits of the account number was simply, he argues, a “technical violation” of §15B that caused no harm to the tenants.</p>

And in another e-mail, he threatened to have a certain car “towed now.” Not only was the car not towed, but the tenants continued to park as usual and the aquaria remained in the apartment until the tenancy ended. So finding, the trial judge concluded that because the lease itself had forbidden parking and pets, those terms dictated the tenancy and constituted clear and convincing evidence that Zhao’s actions did not constitute a reprisal. Zhao therefore had an independent justification for sending e-mails addressing those issues. Because Zhao had not altered Stacy’s parking or pets arrangements, no damage was shown.
