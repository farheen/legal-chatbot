The Post claims that for the entire four-year period the District government greatly overvalued the improvements on the property, chiefly by miscalculating the gross building area as comprising more than 900,000 square feet when in fact the building was barely more than 500,000 square feet in size. The result, the Post argues, is that the assessments on the improvements were excessive and invalid as a matter of local law, and that when compared with assessments on comparable improvements in the area they reveal a pattern of intentional overvaluation of the Post’s improvements in violation of constitutional equal protection, thus subjecting the District to liability for damages (and attorney’s fees) under <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>.

The Board nonetheless sustained the proposed assessments. The Post then filed timely petitions in Superior Court, § 47 — 825(i), and the court set the matter for trial. The District did not dispute, and the trial judge found, that as to each assessment “[tjhere [was] a flaw in the allocation between land and improvements of the subject [property].” Whereas the District’s assessment records had shown the improvements (or gross building area) to be 978,755 square feet, the improvements in fact contained approximately 513,484 square feet. Moreover, the parties agreed that the building had only a “nominal value.” The Post’s expert (Reynolds) testified that “there is no compelling reason to retain the building” and the average buyer would “get rid of it.” The District’s assessor for 1986 (Davis) agreed that the “real value in this property was in the land.” Davis testified that “[i]f I had to do it all over again <em>[i.e., </em>the 1986 assessment] ...

It makes a “local law challenge [to] the assessments” based solely upon the asserted over-assessment (as compared to market value) of the improvements to the 15th Street property, an error in turn stemming from the miscalculation of the square footage of the improvements. It then makes an equal protection challenge to the assessment of the improvements compared to the assessment of similarly situated properties. Both arguments rely on the premise that the District by statute must assess land and improvements separately, and that an overvaluation of either component compared to market value entitles the taxpayer to a refund, either under the statute or “on equalization grounds” superimposed on local taxation laws by the Constitution. We reject this premise and hold, with the trial judge, that because the Post’s property in question was fairly assessed in its entirety — land <em>and </em>improvements — at well below market value, any misallocation of value between the two components provides no basis for a refund or damages.</p>

From these provisions appellant makes the statutory argument that a taxpayer may challenge the assessment either of its land or of its improvements as in excess of market value, while relying on a presumption that the other assessment is proper. <em>See Glen Wall Assocs. v.

The Post's own valuation expert, Reynolds, conceded that the improvements on the 15th Street property had only nominal value (he assigned a value of approximately $5 million to them) and that the estimated value of the property was far higher than the total assessment for each of the four years. The District’s assessor for 1985 (Klugel) testified that the Post’s assessments — "frozen” at $52.4 million for four years in a row — were “extremely conservative, low in fact”; and the 1986 assessor (Davis) had since “determined that the [actual] land value exceeded the total assessment” of $52.4 million. Thus there was abundant evidence — sufficient to overcome any presumption — from which the Board and the trial judge could find that the land component of the property had been substantially undervalued.</p>

Congress enacted the present real property tax law in part to insure “[e]quitable sharing of the financial burden of the government of the District of Columbia.” D.C.Code § 47-801(1). To carry out that purpose, the District must assess all “real property” annually. § 47-821(a). “Real property” is a term of art defined to include both land and improvements: “ ‘real property’ means real estate identified by plat on the records of the District of Columbia Surveyor according to lot and square together with improvements thereon.” § 47-802(1). A tax is levied annually “on the real property in the District of Columbia,” § 47-811(a), and “the assessed value of all real property shall be listed on the assessment roll.” § 47-820(a). While the assessment must “identify[ ] separately the value of land and improvements thereon,” the Mayor’s basic obligation is to “assess all real property ... and administer and collect the real property tax within the District.” § 47-821(a). In turn, taxpayers may appeal assessments to the Board of Equalization and Review, which must “assure that all real property is assessed at the estimated market value,” § 47-825(f); the Board must “raise or lower the estimated market value of any real property” if there is more than a <em>5% </em>discrepancy between market value and the District’s proposed assessment. <em><a href="/citations/?q=491%20A.2d%201247" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="491 A.2d 1247">Id.</a></em>

Indeed, as the District points out, refusal to permit readjustment for misallo-cation would lead to the possibility of refunds (for either land or improvements) even though the property assessment as a whole is within market value, contrary to the statutory goal of “equitable sharing” of the District’s financial burden. Undoubtedly, the statute’s requirement that the value of land and improvements be identified separately serves important purposes. For example, certain exemptions from taxation apply only to land or improvements, but not to both. <em>E.g., </em>D.C.Code § 47-1002(6H17). The law also requires the District to increase or reduce the assessment of improvements during the tax year to reflect value changes resulting from new construction, alteration and the like. § 47-829(a).

Although the building increased the value of the property substantially (to $20.9 million, compared to the $5.8 million ascribed entirely to the land), no value for the building had been entered on the assessment notices and its value had never been considered by the assessors.

As to the Post’s property, the dispute over the size of the improvements had not influenced Davis’s 1986 assessment (he was not even aware of the dispute at the time) because “the market is not dependent upon the gross building area” but on the total value of the property; “the assessment really does not ...' hinge on the allocation.” As Davis concluded, “If I had to do it all over again ...

Davis and Klugel testified that the District, like most jurisdictions, employs the mass appraisal technique, which Davis defined as “a correlation of the three accepted approaches to value, including income, cost, and comparable sales, with a strong emphasis on equalization.” As a means to determine how close annual assessments are to market value, the government is required to compile and publish in the D.C. Register annual “assessment-sales ratio studies,” D.C.Code § 47-823(c), which compare property sales prices with property assessments and express the result as a percentage of sales price. The studies use proposed assessments in the comparison, and these may understate or overstate the final ratios depending on whether the assessment is raised or lowered after administrative or judicial appeal.</p>

As the District points out, the Post presented no evidence that adjustments to assessments by the Board resulted in average assessment-sales ratios that fell below the Post’s average in any year. As for the staleness claim, the study derived from the published ratios compared assessments with sales prices for the year <em>following </em>the valuation date, hence insuring that the sales considered were close in time to the Post’s actual (rather than proposed) assessment. Although the abstracted ratios compared only office building sales and assessments (excluding vacant land sales), they included properties whose improvements .contributed very nominal value, as when the improvements had been gutted or renovated after the sale. Thus, we cannot say that the comparative studies were so lacking in probative value that the judge could not rely on them to find equalization.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> It follows that the Post has not demonstrated error by the assessors “amounting] to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity.” <em>Sunday Lake Iron Co., </em><a href="/us/247/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="247 U.S. 350" data-case-ids="1484692" data-case-paths="/us/247/0350-01">247 U.S. at 353</a>, <a href="/us/247/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="247 U.S. 350" data-case-ids="1484692" data-case-paths="/us/247/0350-01">38 S.Ct. at 353</a>; <em>see, </em>by contrast, <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co., </em><a href="/us/488/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="488 U.S. 336" data-case-ids="1495027" data-case-paths="/us/488/0336-01">488 U.S. at 344-46</a>, <a href="/us/488/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="488 U.S. 336" data-case-ids="1495027" data-case-paths="/us/488/0336-01">109 S.Ct. at 638-39</a> (“[Ijntentional systematic undervaluation” of comparable neighboring property shown by assessment of petitioner’s property at level roughly 8 to 35 times greater over more than ten-year period).</p>

Thus, the trial judge was not bound by the Board’s finding to ignore the evidence that the respective values of the land and improvements had been misallocated, and hence — since there was no proof neighboring properties had experienced similar misallo-cation — that the land component of the Post’s assessment was not in equalization. Indeed, Klugel testified that, whereas other assessments "were going up annually," the Post had <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>“slip[ped] through the cracks” because its property is "unique,” "a hybrid,” and a "misuse of the land,” so that there had been "a reluctanc[e] on the part of the assessing staff to try to properly value this property year-after-year-after-year.”</p>

Nor has appellant shown clear error in the judge’s acceptance of the testimony of Davis and Klugel over that of the Post’s expert Reynolds, who concluded that the Post’s <em>land </em>and neighboring lots had been assessed uniformly during the years in question but that the building assessments were not in equalization. For the reasons already discussed, the judge could reasonably reject computations that treated the Post’s land and building assessments separately. Moreover, the judge noted that Reynolds had made no inspections or appraisals of other properties in the area, and thus was "unable to provide with any reasonable degree of certainty an opinion as to the difference between the assessed value of other properties located near or adjacent to the [Post’s property] and their market values.” Reynolds did estimate (though not wanting to be held to the figure) that the neighboring properties were assessed at roughly 70% of their market value, a percentage that was higher than the Post’s assessment to value ratio for 1986-88, and equal to its ratio for 1985.</p>
