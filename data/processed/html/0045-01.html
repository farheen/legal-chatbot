    <p id="b76-9" data-blocks='[["BL_76.9",76,[218,1105,757,818]]]'>In an action for assessment of damages following a taking by eminent domain by the defendant, Town of West Warwick (the town), the plaintiff, Sun-Lite Partnership (Sun-Lite), appeals from a Superior Court judgment finding that the market value of the condemned property was $66,396.86. Sun-Lite argues that the trial justice erroneously rejected expert opinion testimony and substituted her own judgment for the value of the land. Additionally, Sun-Lite contends that the trial justice improperly averaged several comparable properties to determine the market value instead of accepting the value of the most similar property.</p>

In 1999, the town commenced eminent domain proceedings on the property as part of its project to revitalize the Arctic Redevelopment Area. The town council, acting as the tax increment finance commission, approved a declaration of eminent domain taking and valued the property at $63,500. The town then filed a petition in Superior Court seeking approval of the taking pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 32 of title 45. On August 13, 1999, the court entered an order granting condemnation and directing the town to deposit $63,500 in the Registry of the Court. Sun-Lite challenged the valuation of $63,500 by filing a petition for assessment of damages on September 30, 1999. In addition, on November 4, 1999, Sun-Lite filed a petition to authorize and direct the Registry of the Court to pay over the deposited sum of $63,500. The two petitions were heard together on November 19-20, 2001, in the Superior Court, and the trial justice issued a decision from the bench on November 20, 2001.</p>

He used eight recent sales of property that he considered comparable to determine a fair market value of the subject parcel. He asserted, however, that of all the sales he analyzed, one, identified as comparable # 5, was the “most comparable.” Gerard Roch, testifying on behalf of the town, employed seven sales of property for comparison purposes. Four sales, designated as #1, #2, # 3, and # 4, were used in common by both appraisers.</p>
    <p id="b77-7" data-blocks='[["BL_77.6",77,[896,263,753,769]]]'>In her bench decision, the trial justice determined that four of the sales upon which Faraone relied, #5, #6, #7, and #8, were not comparable to the subject parcel. Sale # 8 was not comparable because the parcel was located on a busy commercial street, and the other three sales were not comparable because Far-aone failed to provide credible evidence about the value of the structures on those lots. The trial justice specifically rejected Faraone’s contention that, because the town intended to raze the buildings located on those lots, the buildings had no value, or indeed, a negative value.</p>

She accepted Roch’s opinion that sale # 1 was not comparable because the parcel is located on a “busier commercial street than the corner on which the subject property is situated.” She found, therefore, that only comparables # 2, # 3, and # 4 were probative in determining the fair market value of the subject parcel.</p>
    <p id="b77-9" data-blocks='[["BL_77.8",77,[892,1619,757,557]]]'>With respect to comparable # 2, the trial justice rejected the adjustments that Roch had made because he believed that the purchaser (the town) had overpaid for the property in order to “reimburse the [sellers] for their pre-condemnation expenses.” She then found that Faraone’s “adjustments as to the sales and prices of parcels two, three, and four are credible, and assess[ed] damages consistent with his opinions.”</p>

However, the record indicates that the trial justice did consider Faraone’s particular reliance on comparable # 5 as being the most similar to the subject parcel because of its size, location, zoning, and date of sale. She rejected his opinion, however, because she did not find Faraone’s analysis credible. The parcel sold in comparable #5 had an income-producing apartment building on it when it was sold, but Faraone was unable to provide any specifics about the structure. The trial justice discounted his opinion that the building had no value because the purchaser (the town) intended to raze it, thereby incurring additional expenses, saying that she did not have “sufficient information about the nature and condition of the <em>structure.” Faraone </em>had no firsthand knowledge of the apartment building, and was unable to provide evidence that it lacked value.
