Michael was unresponsive, and Mrs. McBurrows heard her husband slap the child on both sides of his face. Mrs. McBurrows walked into the bathroom and heard the defendant repeat the question. This time, Michael replied that he was supposed to close his eyes. She saw her husband hit the child again. Defendant asked the question one more time and, again, Michael responded as before.

Mrs. McBurrows tried to intervene, but defendant raised the level at her, demanding to know what she wanted. Fearing for her safety, she backed down.</blockquote>

The trial court precluded wife from testifying regarding these observations finding they constituted a confidential communication under the marital privilege, and the State appealed. At issue was whether the marital privilege set forth in K.S.A. 6(M28(a) and K.S.A. 60-437 was limited to information directly and intentionally conveyed by words or included information derived by one spouse from observation of the acts of the other. The <em>Newman </em>court acknowledged the split within the jurisdictions on this issue. However, after considering the Kansas Code and the public policy interests involved, it concluded the statutory marital privilege does not extend to all observations of the acts of one spouse by the other. It found “[t]he marital privilege is limited to spoken or written statements or nonverbal signs or gestures seeking to transmit information from one spouse to another.” <em>Id. </em>at 266.

The facts reveal that shortly after Mrs. McBurrows arrived home from Abington Hospital, the Appellee drove her to an abandoned church in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. When Mrs. McBurrows was in the van, she noticed two plastic bags on the floor of the front seat. One of the bags contained two mason’s levels. Mrs. McBurrows was aware the Appellee had used one of these levels to strike the victim earlier that morning. The Appellee then stopped the vehicle, threw both mason’s levels over an abandoned fence and indicated he was donating them. Under a narrow interpretation of § 5914, we find Mrs. McBurrows’ observance of the Appellee’s act of disposing of the mason’s levels does not fall within the marital privilege.

Although the Court’s recitation of evidence in <em>Clark </em>does not indicate that a confidential communication was made at the time of the observed conduct, the absence of such a statement, in my opinion, creates a void rather than an inconsistency and therefore, it does not diminish the authority of <em>Clark. </em>Furthermore, the Majority does not address Judge Cercone’s reasoning that the observed conduct was privileged because it and the confidential communication both arose from the marital relationship. <em>See Clark, </em><a href="/pa-super/347/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="347 Pa.

The foregoing jurisdictions all have marital privilege statutes substantially similar to Pennsylvania’s section 5914. The rule adopted by these jurisdictions is consistent with the principle underlying Judge Cer-cone’s statement in <em>Clark; </em>the privilege applies to knowledge of facts acquired by reason of the marital relation. The rationale for this rule was most eloquently stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[221,1522,716,1173]],["BL_564.5",564,[1027,287,712,560]]]'>But it is not enough to throw protection over communications made in the spirit of confidence. The intimacy of the marriage union enables each to be daily and almost constantly witness of the conduct of the other; and thus in fact a confidence, reaching much farther than that of verbal communication, is forced upon each of the parties. What one may even desire to conceal from all human eyes and ears is thus almost unavoidably brought within the observation of the other.... The rule we deem a valuable one, and we view with apprehension any exception having a tendency, more or less direct, to promote cunning, or to generate distrust, where the best interests of society require that perfect frankness and confidence ought to prevail. If one exception be sanctioned, because, from the character of the criminal act imputed, the dissent of the witness from its commission must be presumed, others may follow, where the like presumption will be entertained, ... and there will be danger of our having no rule capable of general and steady application .... Moreover, the rule is not founded exclusively upon an actual voluntary confidence reposed by one of the married pair in the other, but also upon the unavoidable confidence which the intimacy of the marriage state necessarily produces.</blockquote>

Rather, I would hold that when a spouse observes conduct that is wedded to a confidential utterance made by the other spouse, then the observation and the statement are not severable. McBurrows’s statement that he was donating the levels coupled with his act of throwing them over the fence constitute a union that is inseparable. Thus, I conclude that pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5914, Wife is not competent to testify that she observed McBurrows throw the levels over the church fence.</p>

We cannot, however, be overcome by the tragedy of the events in this case. The Majority views the issue as one of an extension of Pennsylvania law. They would restrict the privilege to oral or written words, and actions intended to convey a message. I disagree. The issue is whether section 5914 derogates the common law rule to an extent so as to permit the admission of <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>Wife’s disputed testimony. <em>See Canole, </em><a href="/pa/222/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="222 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="959401" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0156-01">222 Pa. at 159</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.%201053" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="70 A. 1053">70 A. at 1055</a> (stating that at common law husband and wife were incompetent to testify against one another). Although the facts before us beg this Court to further erode the marital privilege at issue, I would decline to do so. In so doing, I am mindful that “[testimonial exclusionary rules and privileges contravene the fundamental principle that the public ... has a right to every man’s evidence.” <em>Trammel v. U.S., </em><a href="/us/445/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="445 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1777844" data-case-paths="/us/445/0040-01">445 U.S. 40</a>, 50, <a href="/us/445/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="445 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1777844" data-case-paths="/us/445/0040-01">100 S.Ct. 906</a>, <a href="/us/445/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="445 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1777844" data-case-paths="/us/445/0040-01">63 L.Ed.2d 186</a> (1980) (omission in original) (quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, I am compelled to acknowledge as valid the time-honored presumption of the common law that society’s interest in protecting the privacy and intimacy of marital relations outweighs the evidentiary needs of the criminal justice system. Hence, I respectfully dissent.</p>
