Cooper is the daughter of George Cooper, the intestate decedent, rather than his sister, and that she is therefore entitled to share in George Cooper’s estate. Before we reach that issue, however, we must resolve a jurisdictional question raised by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>following oral argument, namely, whether the trial judge’s decision in Mignon Cooper’s favor is an appealable final order.</p>

Mignon Cooper and Ms. McCloud further alleged that Mignon Cooper is the “natural daughter” of the decedent, and that Ms. Murphy had “purposely omitted” Mignon Cooper, in the Petition for Probate, from the list of persons having an interest in the estate.

They contemplate a “plenary proceeding,” § 16-3105, which is terminated by an enforceable judgment.

First, she contends that the judge’s factual findings in Mignon Cooper’s favor were induced by a misapprehension as to the burden the law imposes on an individual who seeks to qualify as one of a decedent’s heirs, but who failed to claim, until after the decedent’s death, a relationship with the decedent which would qualify her to participate in the estate. Second, she claims that the judge erroneously accorded decisive weight to what she regards as a seriously flawed birth certificate. Finally, she asserts that the judge failed to attach appropriate legal significance to Mignon Cooper’s failure to testify in a case in which she had been accused, in effect, of making a fraudulent claim, and in which she could also reasonably be expected to be familiar with critical material facts.

The judge’s oral decision does not explicitly reflect the traditional judicial concern regarding the danger of fraud where a claim of paternity has been made against an intestate decedent. The occasion for such a concern is surely at its zenith where, as here, both the claimant and her principal witness have significant criminal backgrounds.

This is particularly true where, as here, the birth certificate has been shown to be inaccurate in other significant respects. Although, as we have noted (and as the trial judge suggested) the proponent’s flawed birth certificate may trump the opponent’s lack of any birth certificate at all, a document with the irregularities which appear on the face of this one provides, at best, a problematic basis for a finding of paternity.</p>

The judge’s ruling in this case was predicated on the hypothesis that, although Mignon Cooper was raised by Pearl Cooper and regarded in the family as “Ma Pearl’s” daughter, she was in fact her granddaughter. The decision therefore rests on an assumption that the Coopers, or some of them, did not know what relationship they had to one another. According to Margaret Murphy, however, members of the Cooper family were well aware of their relationships to other members of the family. If Ms. Murphy’s testimony was correct, then the judge’s findings rest on an incorrect premise.</p>

I suppose that, contrary to my “bright line” views about such cases expressed in <em>Glover, </em>someone could posit facts where a claimant could establish paternity, after the father’s death, even though the putative father had not openly acknowledged fatherhood during his lifetime. But, in this case, where the trial judge found that George Cooper’s mother, Pearl Cooper, raised Mignon Cooper as her daughter, not as her granddaughter, and where there is no proffered reason (pertaining to Kathleen Hayes or otherwise) as to why George Cooper would not have acknowledged paternity of Mignon Cooper during his lifetime — if it were true — I see no basis for the trial court to find that Mignon Cooper was George Cooper’s daughter.</p>
