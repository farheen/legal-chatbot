The trial record was filed in this court on December 4, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b603-25" data-blocks='[["BL_603.26",603,[1011,645,752,528]]]'>In September 1980, both defendants filed motions which sought the dismissal of the indictment. The motions are an effort, in the light of our holding in <em>State v. Jenison, </em>R.I., <a href="/ri/122/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="405 A.2d 3" data-case-ids="5548492" data-case-paths="/ri/122/0142-01">405 A.2d 3</a> (1979), to challenge the composition of the grand jury which indicted them and the jury which heard the evidence. Arguments on the motions and the merits of the appeal were heard by us on October 6, 1980. Barton subsequently renewed his motion.</p>

In that order we emphasized that the only defendants who might benefit in any manner from the <em>Jeni-son </em>rule were those who, before trial, had challenged the composition of the grand or petit jury by filing a motion prior to trial pursuant to Super.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) and (3). Neither defendant invoked the rule, and their reliance on <em>State v.
