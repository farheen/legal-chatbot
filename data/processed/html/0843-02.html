Borgia’s damages from the accident exceeded $15,000, the limit of the liability coverage available under the policy issued by State Farm Insurance Company to the driver of the other vehicle. Borgia had insured his automobile through a policy issued by Nationwide Insurance Company, but had elected to waive both uninsured and un-derinsured motorist coverage (“UM” and “UIM” coverage, respectively).</p>

His father owned two automobiles that were covered under a separate policy of insurance issued by Appellee, the Prudential Insurance Company (“Prudential”). Lacking UIM coverage under his own policy, Borgia filed a claim for such coverage under his parents’ policy. Prudential denied the claim on the grounds that, <em>inter alia, </em>Borgia was not a named insured, and his car was not a covered vehicle. Borgia was unwilling to accept Prudential’s determination.</p>

That same day, Borgia filed a petition to appoint arbitrators and to compel arbitration. By order of November 7, 1995, the trial court (Bonavitacola, P.J.) granted Borgia’s petition and scheduled an arbitration hearing. Prudential, in its declaratory judgment action, filed a motion to stay arbitration. The trial court (O’Keefe, J.) denied the motion, and an arbitration hearing took place. The trial court subsequently denied Prudential’s motion for reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration (Bonavitacola, P.J.) and dismissed Prudential’s declaratory judgment action “without prejudice to be[ing] reopened when uninsured [sic] motorist provisions have been exhausted” <a id="p845" href="#p845" data-label="845" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*845</a>(Moss, J.).

Borgia filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award. In both the declaratory judgment action and the arbitration action, the trial court (O’Keefe, J.) entered orders denying relief to Prudential and confirming the arbitrators’ award. Final judgments in Borgia’s favor were entered in both actions. Prudential appealed from both judgments, and the Superior Court consolidated the appeals <em>sua sponte.</em>

The Superior Court agreed, reasoning that, regardless of whether the alleged agreement called for statutory or common law arbitration, the trial court’s first ta.sk, upon being presented with a petition to compel arbitration, was to determine whether the parties had in fact agreed to arbitrate. The relevant inquiry, according to the Superior Court, was not simply whether the insurance policy contained an arbitration clause, but whether the party who had petitioned to compel arbitration was one who, under the terms of the contract, was entitled to enforce such clause. If the petitioner did not meet the requirements of the contract in that regard, the Superior Court explained, there was no agreement to arbitrate between the insurer and the petitioner, and, accordingly, no basis for sending the parties’ dispute to arbitration. The Superior Court emphasized that “the question of whether a particular party may enforce the arbitration agreement is for the trial court.”.</p>

Borgia reasons that, since the arbitration clause at issue provided for arbitration of disputes concerning “policy coverages,” his substantive dispute with Prudential was necessarily arbitrable, and the arbitrators were therefore authorized to decide all matters necessary to the resolution of that dispute. Whether Borgia was a covered person under his parents’ policy was, he contends, one of the matters — perhaps <em>the </em>essential matter— that had to be resolved in order to dispose of his claim. Borgia asserts that the arbitrators resolved the issue in his favor, and in doing so they did not deny Prudential a hearing, nor was the arbitration process tainted by fraud, misconduct, corruption, or any similar irregularity that would warrant <em>setting </em>aside the award. In Borgia’s view, Prudential’s fundamental argument to the Superior Court was that the arbitrators erred as a matter of law when they found that Borgia was a covered person under the policy. A common law arbitration award is not reviewable for such errors, however, and therefore, Borgia contends, the Superior Court exceeded its scope of review when it vacated the judgments in Borgia’s favor.</p>

As noted earlier, the arbitration clause provides that “if [Prudential] and <em>a covered person </em>disagree on <em>policy coverages </em>or amounts payable, either party may make a written demand for arbitration” (emphasis added). Prudential contends that, pursuant to this language, a determination that the claimant is a covered person must <em>precede </em>arbitration of coverage disputes. Such a requirement is not apparent from the language of the arbitration clause, however. The quoted phrase does not draw a clear distinction between parties who are entitled to invoke arbitration and matters which may be arbitrated, and a common-sense interpretation suggests that the phrase “disagree[ments] on policy coverages,” denoting a category of arbitrable matters, would encompass a dispute as to whether a claimant was “a covered person” under the policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Significantly, although the status of “covered person” is purportedly a threshold requirement for arbitration, that crucial term is not defined anywhere in the policy. To complicate matters further, Prudential attempts to distinguish <em>Baverso </em>by arguing that the party who sought arbitration in that case had “a legitimate and colorable claim” to the status of “insured.” In so doing, Prudential implies that a mere “legitimate and colorable claim” to the status of “covered person” would be sufficient to authorize a claimant to demand arbitration under Part V of the Prudential policy.</p>

Pursuant to <em>Kuhn </em>and <em>Brennan, </em>such ambiguity is not to be resolved by inserting into the arbitration agreement a requirement for court proceedings to resolve the purported threshold issue, but by applying the settled principle that ambiguous language is to be interpreted against the drafter — in this case, Prudential. Thus, the arbitration clause, insofar as it specifies the scope of arbitration, must be construed broadly, with the result that whether Borgia was a “covered person” within the meaning of the policy was an issue to be decided by the arbitrators.

The policy issued to Borgia’s parents does not define the term “covered person.” Part 5 of the policy explains that, if the policyholder has purchased UIM coverage, Prudential "will pay up to our limit of liability for bodily injury that is covered under this part when an insured (whether or not occupying a car) is struck by an underinsured motor vehicle.” As for who is an insured, the policy provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the policyholder and "resident relatives” are insured while using the policyholder’s car, a "substitute car,” or a "non-owned car.” A "substitute car” is one which the policyholder has borrowed temporarily to replace a covered car that is being repaired or replaced; it cannot b.e a car that is owned by the policyholder or a household resident. A "non-owned” car includes rental cars, and the policy specifies that such a car must be used with its owner’s permission and in the manner intended by the owner. Prudential concedes, and the Superior Court acknowledged, that Borgia was a resident relative in his parents’ household. Nevertheless, the court agreed with Prudential's assertion that Borgia was not entitled to UIM benefits because his accident occurred while he was driving a vehicle that could not be deemed either a substitute car or a non-owned car under the policy.</p>

In this respect, the present case is distinguishable from <em>Baverso. </em>The policy in <em>Bav-erso </em>provided for the arbitration of disagreements concerning the insured’s legal entitlement to collect damages <em>from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, </em>or the amount of such damages. Arguably, such language limits the scope of arbitration to issues arising from the claimant's underlying tort action against the owner or operator of the other vehicle, and does not encompass a disagreement as to whether the claimant was in fact "an insured.” The policy in the present case,'in contrast, utilizes the broader, less specific term "policy coverages” to define the scope of arbitration, and that phrase is fairly read to encompass the claimant's asserted status as a "covered person.” Whether the Superior Court in <em>Baverso </em>improperly extended this Court's holding in <em>Brennan </em>is a question that is not before us in this case.

In other words, if the appellant does not meet the threshold requirement of the contract to be deemed a “covered person,” then there was no agreement to arbitrate between the insurer and the appellant and, therefore, no basis for sending the parties’ underlying coverage dispute to arbitration in the first place.

Borgia sustained damages in excess of $15,000. However, the car that hit his was only insured for damages to Borgia up to its policy limit of $15,000. This action arose because Borgia, who did not opt for uninsured motorist (UM) or underinsured motorist (UIM) protection under his own policy, sought to recover his damages in excess of $15,000 from his parents’ underinsured motorists policy coverage. Under the Prudential policy, as explained, <em>supra, </em>bodily injury to a resident relative such as appellant is covered only so long as the claimant is using a covered car.</p>
    <p id="b902-18" data-blocks='[["BL_902.19",902,[1026,1025,753,896]]]'>Thus, although Borgia was a resident relative of the insureds under the Prudential policy, he was not using any of the covered cars under the policy and he was not a pedestrian. Additionally, language in the UM/UIM section of the policy fails to accord “covered person” status to Borgia by virtue of the fact that, although he was a resident relative and was injured by an underinsured motorist, it was while in a car owned by him and not insured under the policy. In short, there is coverage only if a named insured or a resident relative is injured while driving a vehicle listed in the Declarations page, while he is a pedestrian, or if the vehicle involved in the accident is <em>not owned by the named insured or by any resident relative.</em>

This conclusion is not only pursuant to the express and unambiguous contract language, it is completely consistent with recent decisions of this Court upholding the "household exclusion” of UIM coverage for bodily injury suffered while not occupying a covered vehicle. Specifically, this Court upheld such provision in <em>Eichelman v. Nationwide Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/551/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="551 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="507777" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0558-01">551 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/a2d/711/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="711 A.2d 1006" data-case-ids="11829726,507777" data-case-paths="/a2d/711/1006-01,/pa/551/0558-01">711 A.2d 1006</a> (1998), where the sole issue was whether a person who, as here, voluntarily elected to forgo UIM coverage on his own vehicle is precluded from recovering UIM benefits from separate policies issued to family members with whom he resides as a result of contract language in the family members’ policy excluding such recovery when he is occupying his own vehicle. In upholding the exclusion, we noted that a claimant who voluntarily chose not to purchase UIM coverage received reduced premiums in return and was thereby required to be held to his voluntary choice. Additionally, we had certain instructive observations about the legislative intent behind the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL) in regard to such exclusions, notably:</p>
      <blockquote id="b903-27" data-blocks='[["BL_903.8",903,[977,1877,690,823]]]'>Allowing the "household exclusion" language to stand in this case is further bolstered by the intent behind the MVFRL, to stop the spiralling [sic] costs of automobile insurance in the Commonwealth. If appellant’s position [that a family member's UIM coverage should insure him when he is occupying his own, undeclared, car] were accepted, it would allow an entire family living in a single household with numerous automobiles to obtain underinsured motorist coverage for each family member through a single insurance policy on one of the automobiles in the household. If this result were allowed, it would most likely result in higher insurance premiums on all insureds (even those without family members living at their residence) since insurers would be required to factor expanded coverage cost into rates charged for underin-sured motorist coverage.</blockquote>
