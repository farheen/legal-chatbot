The imposition of a one-year suspension as a result of Smega’s Ohio DUI conviction, by operation of Section 1532(b)(3) of the Code and Article IV(l)(b) and (3) of the Compact, did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of either the Fifth Amendment or Article I, Section 10, of the Pennsylvania Constitution. First, because the imposition of the suspension flows automatically from Smega’s underlying DUI conviction, and the Department has no discretion as to whether to impose the suspension, there was no separate “proceeding” for double jeopardy purposes. <em>Martin v.

Second, the suspension of the operating privilege is a collateral civil consequence of Smega’s Ohio DUI conviction and is not “punishment” for double jeopardy purposes, since it serves the remedial purpose of protecting the general public from intoxicated drivers. <em>Krall v.

Ohio courts have interpreted the term “under the influence” to mean that a “defendant must have consumed alcohol to such an extent as to appreciably impair his ability to operate a motor vehicle.” <em>State v.

    <p id="b214-9" data-blocks='[["BL_214.10",214,[192,1214,757,1179]]]'>Although the majority concludes that section 434.01(A)(1) of the North Ridgeville Ordinance is substantially similar to section 3731(a) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a), the majority notes that the record in this case does not contain the complete Ordinance but only the subsection under which Smega was convicted. Based on the present state of the record, it is patently impossible for this court to determine whether or not this subsection of the Ordinance is a lesser offense as the New York and Maryland statutes were in <em>Olmstead v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em><a href="/a2d/677/1285-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="677 A.2d 1285" data-case-ids="7877574" data-case-paths="/a2d/677/1285-01">677 A.2d 1285</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1996), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em><a href="/pa/550/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="550 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="281259" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0578-01">550 Pa. 578</a>, <a href="/a2d/707/1144-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="707 A.2d 1144" data-case-ids="11863084,11863112,11863165,281220,281259,281286" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/1144-01,/a2d/707/1144-02,/a2d/707/1144-03,/pa/550/0577-01,/pa/550/0578-01,/pa/550/0579-01">707 A.2d 1144</a> (1998) and <em>Eck v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em><a href="/a2d/713/0744-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="713 A.2d 744" data-case-ids="11820045" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/0744-01">713 A.2d 744</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1998). Thus, the majority’s conclusion regarding the similarity of these statutory provisions is based squarely on the unwarranted assumption that section 434.01(A)(1) of the Ordinance is not a lesser offense of another subsection of the Ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b214-12" data-blocks='[["BL_214.15",214,[998,235,752,797]]]'>In addition, in determining that this subsection of the ordinance is substantially similar to section 3731(a) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, the majority relies on case law interpreting provisions of the Ohio Revised Code that contain language similar to that contained in section 434.01(A)(1) of the Ordinance. However, there is absolutely no support for the proposition that the language employed in these two distinct statutory provisions promulgated by two distinct legislative bodies has ever been interpreted in the same manner. Because I do not believe that it is proper to reverse the order of the trial court based on such unsupported conjecture and speculation, I would affirm the order of that court.</p>
