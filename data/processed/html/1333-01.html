She stated that in June or July 1978, Mr. Collin King, her immediate supervisor, came up behind her and rubbed his genitalia against her back. Complainant pushed him away and threatened to tell his wife about the incident. She also testified that approximately six weeks later, King walked into her office and attempted to kiss her.

She told Jameson that Key had said that the whole matter was a set-up of complainant. Jameson, however, told complainant that King and Doxie were within their rights to request a memorandum and he agreed with any decision to suspend her if she refused. Complainant reiterated her refusal to prepare the memorandum and stated that she would rather be fired than suspended. At her meeting with Jameson, she did not mention sexual advances by King. Following her meeting with Mr. Jameson, complainant was suspended without pay. Ms. Langhorne continued to refuse to prepare the memorandum and on March 19, 1979, she was terminated from employment.

As to Finding of Fact No. 44(a), the evidence in the record does not support a finding that the requested memorandum concerned an incident which “was blown out of all reasonable proportions” by King, Doxie, Washington, and Jameson. So long as King thought that complainant’s conversation with Key simply involved a routine client complaint, he suggested that complainant forget about the matter. It was only after King was told by Doxie that complainant had been rude in her conversation with Key that he requested that she write a memorandum about the conversation. Nothing in the record suggests that King was acting unreasonably in requesting a memorandum about possible rudeness to a client by one of his employees. Nor is there anything that suggests that King would <a id="p1340" href="#p1340" data-label="1340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1340</a>have anticipated that complainant would refuse to prepare a memorandum, thus bringing about a confrontation. Furthermore, it was after complainant refused his request to submit the memorandum that King wrote a memorandum to Washington reporting complainant’s insubordination. While King stated that he would not “tolerate this travesty,” he fairly reported complainant’s reasons for refusing to submit the memorandum and did not recommend any punishment for complainant. Thus, the incident was “blown out of proportion” by complainant’s persistent refusal to write the memorandum.</p>

Finding of Fact 44(c) that petitioner never investigated the conversation with Key is irrelevant as well. Her eventual termination was not the result of the supposed complaint by Dr. Key or her treatment of him on the telephone; rather, it was her continued refusal to write a memorandum, amounting to insubordination, which led to her dismissal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Finally, the record does not support the implication of Finding of Fact No. 44(d) that her insubordination was a minor infraction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>
