The subscription fee requirement of the Purchasing Agreement violates this right, they contend, and therefore creates an impediment to the free access to public records contemplated by Section 2.</p>

Although the Agreement clearly appoints PLCM as the exclusive agent of DGS for providing information concerning the Purchasing Program to municipalities, it does not have the effect of precluding DGS from responding to any proper Right-to-Know Act request from a citizen. In the absence of proof or even allegations to the contrary, this Court may rely on the time-honored presumption that public officials will perform their duties properly, <em>see Nason v. Commonwealth, </em>90 Pa.Cmwlth. 130, <a href="/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%20499" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="494 A.2d 499">494 A.2d 499</a> (1985), to conclude that DGS will continue to respond appropriately to proper Right-to-Know Act requests, even without resort to <a id="p1157" href="#p1157" data-label="1157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1157</a>the uncontradicted representations in the affidavit of the Deputy Secretary.</p>
    <p id="b1215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1215.4",1215,[180,371,751,897]]]'>The Associations also contend that the Agreement exceeds the legal authority of the contracting parties. Based on their view of the Agreement as burdening and impeding the free flow of Purchasing Program information, they assert that DGS lacks power to frustrate the intent of the Act establishing the program. They contend also that PLCM’s participation exceeds its authority under 53 P.S. § 451, which is restricted to matters involving the cities that comprise the league. Because PLCM is not itself a municipality or “similar general purpose unit of government” within the definition of “municipality” in Section 1 of the Act of July 12, 1972, P.L. 762, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 481, the Associations argue that PLCM has no statutory authority empowering it to engage in municipal governmental action.</p>

That Section expressly requires DGS to set terms and conditions of participation in the Purchasing Program. Therefore, DGS has not exceeded its authority.</p>

Further, although the Agreement is styled “Intergovernmental,” it does not require PLCM to perform functions different from those that might be requested of a private company engaged to manage the dispersal of this particular information. It does not require PLCM to act as a municipality, nor does it authorize PLCM to perform functions that must be performed by the state government, for example, the denial of a request to participate in a particular purchase.

I do not believe that section 2403(h) contemplated a situation in which, based on PLCM membership, municipalities would be treated differently in accessing contract information from DGS. Such a system adds another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, hinders the free flow of information from DGS to <em>all </em>qualifying municipalities in the Commonwealth, and runs contrary to the purpose of section 2403(h). As a result, I must dissent.</p>
