The Company’s motions, filed between the Phase I rate of return hearing and the <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>Phase II rate design hearing, requested that the rate schedules which the Company intended to propose in the Phase II hearings be implemented immediately on a temporary basis with excess charges refundable if different permanent rates were adopted, or in the alternative, that a nonrefundable temporary uniform surcharge be approved. Finding that either plan proposed by the Company would be impracticable, yet recognizing the Company was entitled to some form of interim relief, the Commission fashioned its own plan based on a formula for a surcharge intended to permit the Company to earn at the 8.8% rate of return authorized in Phase I. Its order was to be effective immediately (May 10, 1974), but the actual collection of the higher rate of return for the interim period was to be postponed until after the Phase II hearing and the establishment of permanent rate schedules to which it would be added as a surcharge in proportion to the increases approved for the various classes of users and amortized over a three-year period.</p>

In <em>Bebchick </em>the court explained its previous remand to make it clear that it had not intended that the Transit Commission could combine with its surplus period, involving illegally charged fares, the ensuing period when losses were suffered in computing the amount of excess revenue which was to be deposited in escrow. Although part of the losses occurred during the time a court order staying a proposed higher rate was in effect, the court held it to be a risk to be borne by the company even though the proposed increased rate was later affirmed on appeal. In holding that the surplus could not be diminished by offsetting losses that were incurred later, the court was dealing with retrospective, not prospective considerations.</p>

One of the reasons given was that if it stayed the fare increase the bus company would not be allowed to subsequently raise its rates to recoup the losses caused by the stay in the event the increased rates authorized by the Transit Commission were approved on appeal. Such recoupment would have necessarily entailed a hearing by the Commission subsequent to the appeal to consider specific past losses caused by the stay. In contrast to both <em>Bebchick </em>and <em>Democratic Central Committee, </em>the Commission in the instant case issued its order increasing revenues in order to compensate for an anticipated future deficiency in earnings. <em>Bebchick </em>and <em>Democratic Central Committee </em>entailed much more than merely deferred collection of a presently effective rate; the issue in those cases was whether or not the Transit Commission would be allowed to calculate future rates on the basis of known past losses.

In fashioning its interim relief proposal, the Commission was attempting to achieve a practical solution to the increasingly vexing rate regulation problem of regulatory lag. Order No. 5644 simply made an interim adjustment for extraordinary future lag which would become collectible at the conclusion of Phase II as an addition to the periodic bill of each user. Such a remedy is consistent with the rationale of the rule against basing future rates on past losses and does not guarantee the utility any particular level of earnings. Federal Power Commission v.

Whether or not the Company is able to maintain such a rate of return during the interim period depends on its own efficiency and the various risk factors which affect it as they affect any business. The risk of earning less than what is authorized is borne by the utility. The Company is not guaranteed a definite rate of return.</p>

    <blockquote id="b280-8" data-blocks='[["BL_280.9",280,[1041,879,715,1054]]]'>There is also the prospect of apparent discrimination among classes of customers even under the refunding procedures proposed by the Company. Only certain classes of customers and types of service would incur interim rate increases if the rates proposed by C &amp; P in its Motion were put into effect before the final Phase II order. The final Phase II order could distribute the revenue requirement differently than C &amp; P has proposed. Thus, the possibility exists that some ratepayers — those whose charges were not increased under an interim order — could be visited with increases under the final order. Since rate increases are not retroactive, these ratepayers would have been favored over those who have contributed to the Company’s revenue requirements meanwhile by paying increased interim rates. Other examples of potential inequities could also be cited.</blockquote>

However, the Commission found in this case that, while the present rates of the Company were not so low as to be confiscatory, the Company would certainly incur a substantial loss in revenue during the prolonged Phase II hearing. It concluded that interim relief was necessary if the Company was to maintain financial integrity, but it wanted to accomplish it in a manner which was fair to all of the interested parties. In light of the circumstances of this case, we do not find it was either illegal or an abuse of implied power for the Commission to exercise its discretion in granting the relief which it has ordered here. Implementing the Company’s proposed users’ rate structure on an interim rate basis without a hearing could have been grossly unfair to the government which was to shoulder a very substantial portion of the increase, a burden it considers unjustified. The Commission also felt that the Company’s alternate proposal of an unrefundable uniform surcharge on the present rate structure would not comport with even a cursory analysis of the current operational data.</p>
