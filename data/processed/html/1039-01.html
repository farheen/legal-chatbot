    <p id="b490-10" data-blocks='[["BL_490.10",490,[292,558,1233,43]]]'>In stating the nature of applicant’s construction, the board said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b490-11" data-blocks='[["BL_490.11",490,[244,628,1325,661]]]'>It is the usual practice in this class of machines to project 16 pictures per •second, see Keller, page 1, lines 68-70, and applicant follows the general practice in this respect. He proposes to gear the intermittent mechanism for moving the film so that the movement occupies 1/8 or 1/12 of the film cycle which means that, with 16 pictures per second, the movement of the picture takes place in 1/128 or 1/192 of a second and he uses a 4-blade shutter which makes a complete revolution during each film cycle, so that the movement of the film takes place during the passage of one blade and there are three obscurations of the light by the other blades while the picture is held stationary. It is explained in the brief that, as the shutter is moving with the film, the time required for making the change appears to be twice that of the periods of obscuration occurring while the film is stationary. The difference would therefore be equal to 1/8 of the cycle of movement, which is too small to produce any objectionable effect. The interruption of the light during projection of the picture tends to reduce the flicker effect but this is well understood in the art, see Power, page 1, lines 71-78.</blockquote>
    <p id="b490-12" data-blocks='[["BL_490.12",490,[290,1313,1062,42]]]'>Appellant states the nature of his invention as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b490-13" data-blocks='[["BL_490.13",490,[237,1381,1329,1028]]]'>The invention relates to a method for the projection of motion pictures having as an object the provision of the cycle to devote as great a proportion of its time for projection to obtain greatest brilliancy and minimum time in moving or framing of the series of pictures. It is contemplated that the movement of the series of pictures be at the rate of 16 per second and causing the interruption of the light during projection to accommodate the eye to the interruption when moving the pictures to and from the frame. Applicant proposes to gear the intermittent machanism for moving the film so that the movement of the film occupies one-eighth or one-twelfth of the cycle, which means that with 16 pictures per second, movement of a picture is effected in 1/128 or 1/192 of a second for a 4-blade shutter. It is a further object of the invention to interrupt the light during the time that the picture is stationary in order that the eye may become accommodated to the alternations which occur between the projection of the picture and the movement- of the picture. As obscuration occurs during the motion of the picture and this occupies one-eighth or one-twelftli of the time of the cycle, nonisochronous flickering during the time devoted to projection would be tiring upon the eye ■of the observer and cause a marked phenomena of flickering. As the time element for moving the picture and its effect in moving is relatively to not only the picture frame but the shutter, the alternation occurring between the last projection and the movement of the film is one at least one-third longer than any other alternation. Applicant has reduced the time of this last alternation to the point where the linear displacement of the film is not sensitive to the eye, nor is the difference in time of the last alternation .appreciably different from the alternation during projection.</blockquote>
