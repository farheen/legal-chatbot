For example, one child testified that he heard D.M. say “Get off me,” (N.T. Trial at 40), and another testified that “I know [Appellant] grabbed [D.M.]. ...” (N.T. Trial at 46). Others followed with similar testimony. In fact, no witness refuted that Appellant grabbed D.M., or that he wanted her to let go. Furthermore, Appellant herself testified as to these facts. (N.T. Trial at 90). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in believing the testimony of the complainant. It is not for this Court to overturn the credibility determinations of the fact-finder. <em>See DeJesus, supra. </em>The record does not support Appellant’s contention that her witnesses overwhelmingly refuted the complainant’s testimony; in fact, much of her witnesses’ testimony supported the complainant’s. Accordingly, we find that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. <em>See Widmer, supra </em>at 753.</p>
