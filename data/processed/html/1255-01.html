The ultimate issue on appeal is whether the HACC is required to pay contributions for its current employees’ purchase of credit for their previous service rendered to various state agencies under the State Employees’ Retirement Code (Retirement Code), <em>as amended, </em>71 Pa.C.S. § 5101 — 5956, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

[cjommunity colleges.” Section 1913-A of the Public School Code of 1949, <em>as amended, </em>added by Section 1 of the Act of July 1, 1985, 24 P.S. § 19-1913-A, also provides that “[a]ll ... employes of the community colleges in the Commonwealth shall be eligible for inclusion in ... the Pennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System.:.. ” Section 5303 of the Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. § 5303, allows every, active member of the Retirement System to purchase credit for “previous <a id="p1257" href="#p1257" data-label="1257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1257</a>state service” which is defined as “[s]ervice rendered as a State employee prior to his most recent entrance in the system.” Section 5102 of the Retirement Code.</p>

In 1999 and 2002, they purchased credit for their previous uncredited state service rendered to the Department of Education; the Department of Health and Welfare and the State Police; and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, respectively. The Retirement System then sent the HACC invoices for the employer’s contributions for its employees’ purchase of credit in the amount of $7837.92.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The HACC refused to pay the amount in the invoices and appealed to the Appeals Committee of the Retirement System.

In so arguing, however, the HACC did not dispute its obligation to pay the employer’s contributions to the retirement benefit funds for the service rendered by its current employees to the HACC.</p>

The hearing examiner concluded that the HACC is not “an agency” under <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20245.7" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pa. Code § 245.7">4 Pa. Code § 245.7</a> required to pay contributions for the purchase of credit for the previous state service. In support, the hearing examiner stated that unlike other state agencies folly funded by the Commonwealth’s General Fund, the HACC cannot request additional funds to cover the “buy back” provisions of the Retirement Code, and that it would be therefore unfair, absurd and unreasonable to require the HACC to pay contributions for its current employees’ purchase of the previous service rendered to other state agencies. The hearing examiner further concluded that even if the HACC is considered an agency under <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20245.7" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Pa. Code § 245.7">4 Pa.

The hearing examiner accordingly recommended that the Board sustain the HACC’s appeal. The Retirement System then filed exceptions to the hearing examiner’s recommendation.</p>

The Board accordingly ordered the HACC to remit the contributions for its employees’ purchase of the previous state service to the Retirement System.

In including employees of the Pennsylvania State University in the definition of “state employees,” Section 5102 of the Retirement Code specifically provides that “the university shall be totally responsible for all employer contributions under section 5507,” as the HACC points out. However, the fact that the definition in Section 5102 does not contain similar language for the State-owned educational institutions, community colleges and other state agencies does not affect the employer’s general obligations to pay contributions clearly set forth in Section 5507 of the Retirement Code.</p>
