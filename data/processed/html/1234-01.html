As shown in the drawings the surfaces which slope towards the lower end of the roadway are longer than the other or intersecting surfaces. This gives a series of alternate long and short tread surfaces, with the longer tread surfaces below the short surfaces. This construction affords elevations which are sufficient to engage the heel of a shoe and hinder the slipping tendency without causing the catching and holding the heel of the shoe so as to cause the pedestrian to trip and fall.</blockquote>

    <p id="b686-11" data-blocks='[["BL_686.12",686,[234,1667,1320,384]]]'>The object sought to be obtained by applicant and in the references, are, we think, the same, viz, to secure a foothold by persons or animals to prevent slipping. Appellant’s application relates broadly to pavements and more particularly to a ramp or inclined plane, that of Kay to an inclined plane or a level surface, and that of Rovedino presumably to a leveTsurface, although his specification is silent upon that subject, except as Ms drawings indicate a level surface.</p>
    <p id="b686-12" data-blocks='[["BL_686.13",686,[234,2069,1320,241]]]'>Appellant describes the purpose of his invention as affording in a ramp or inclined roadway “ an inclined tread surface which includes tread portions affording substantially level tread surfaces which assure a safe footing for pedestrcmis ”; a further purpose is described as providing drainage at all times.</p>

He describes a pavement composed of bricks or blocks, having the upper surface serrated, several forms being shown in his drawings in longitudinal and transverse sections. An inspection of the figures in said drawings show the surface to be made up of series of oppositely inclined surfaces merging into each other, more especially when continuously serrated blocks, as shown in Figure 4 of his drawings, are used.</p>
    <p id="b687-6" data-blocks='[["BL_687.6",687,[49,929,1323,344]]]'>Appellant contends that the tribunals of the Patent Office misconstrued Bovedino’s drawings in that they have construed the crests of the serrated blocks there shown as comparable to the flattened tread surfaces shown in appellant’s specification-. We think the serrated surfaces shown by Bovedino are comparable to the “ tread surfaces ” found in appellant’s claims, for they are all tread surfaces, including the serrated edges thereof.</p>
    <p id="b687-7" data-blocks='[["BL_687.7",687,[51,1282,1320,186]]]'>It is true that Bovedino shows, in addition to his serrated blocks, ends of the same cut and sloped toward the outer ends, but Figure 4 of his drawing shows a construction without this feature, which construction he calls “ continuous serrated. ”</p>
    <p id="b687-8" data-blocks='[["BL_687.8",687,[50,1484,1320,233]]]'>It is obvious that when Bovedino’s blocks are laid transverse to the roadway, a drain will result as described in appellant’s claims, and we think it is clear that Bovedino shows placing his blocks with the serrated edges or surfaces transverse to the going way of the road.</p>
    <p id="b687-9" data-blocks='[["BL_687.9",687,[49,1734,1330,696]]]'>We think appellant’s claims read directly upon the Bovedino patent, unless there be invention in applying the method therein disclosed to a ramp or inclined roadway. We are clear that there is no invention in so applying it. In the-first place, there is nothing in Bovedino’s application from which it could be inferred that he had only in mind a level roadway. His invention relates to paving blocks, and his object was to afford a secure foothold for horses and prevent the frequent occurrence of slipping. We must assume that he had in mind paved roadways, “ up hill and down dale, ” as well as upon the level. Certainly his pavement upon a hill would present-exactly the same general contour as appellant’s ramp or inclined roadway. But even if the Bovedino patent should be construed to be limited to a level roadway, we agree with the Board of Appeals that to apply his construction to a ramp would not involve invention.</p>
