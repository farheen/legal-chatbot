The presumption of legitimacy was not rebutted by non-access or impotency, and the blood test, which at that point was irrelevant, was the basis upon which the presumption was rebutted. In addition to estoppel applying in this case, whereby both husband and wife may not deny paternity of the child, the presumption of paternity that applies to the intact family prevents an Order by the court for a blood test or the use of one privately obtained to rebut the presumption.</p>

George moved out in July, 1991, <em>four months before </em>the child was born. Lisa testified at the time of conception, she was having an affair with King, and her husband George slept on the couch and she slept in the bedroom. Furthermore, George, at the time, was capable of conception. The husband filed for divorce <em>before the birth of the child, </em>upon learning Lisa was pregnant by King. King visited the hospital upon the child’s birth and continued to visit the child and to pay a stipend for her support for two years, until the support action was filed upon which the paternity issue was litigated.

The first attempts to equate children born out of wedlock with children born during marriage, before paternity has been established in the former. Appellant would have the child born out of wedlock, before determination of paternity, given equal protection consideration comparable to children of a marriage before and after separation as analyzed in <em>Curtis v. Kline, </em><a href="/pa/542/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="542 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="459017" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0249-01">542 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/a2d/666/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="666 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="12044378,459017" data-case-paths="/a2d/666/0265-01,/pa/542/0249-01">666 A.2d 265</a> (1995). This is specious at best. In <em>Kline, </em>the equal protection application came about between children as a class who at the outset were equal as they were children of a marriage. The equal protection application was implicated when children of divorced parents were given the right by statute to obtain college support by court action when children of intact families were not given the same right. Thus a child of divorce or separation was provided a legal remedy against his parents which would not be available to a child whose parents were living together. The inequity of this legislation is self-evident. There can be no equal protection analogy between children of a marriage presumed by law to be the child of the parties to the marriage, and children bom outside a marriage who have no standing until there is a legal acknowl-edgement or finding of paternity. Only after paternity is established is the out-of-wedlock child entitled to equal protection vis a vis the marital child to the same treatment. This argument is treated for purposes of the State Constitution under the incorporation doctrine in the same fashion as the Federal Constitution. The equal protection argument that a putative father, who is also a married man with children of his marriage, may be required to take a blood test in a paternity action, vis a vis another woman, which may result in the destruction of his marriage, misses the point. The thrust of the equal protection argument goes to the right of the child born out of wedlock to have the support of his father to the same degree as a child born during a marriage, even if the unfortunate result might be the destabilization of the father’s marriage. <em>See Gomez v. Perez, </em><a href="/us/409/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="409 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="6177847" data-case-paths="/us/409/0535-01">409 U.S. 535</a>, <a href="/us/409/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="409 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="6177847" data-case-paths="/us/409/0535-01">93 S.Ct. 872</a>, <a href="/us/409/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="409 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="6177847" data-case-paths="/us/409/0535-01">35 L.Ed.2d 56</a> (1973) (the law of Texas may not constitutionally grant legitimate children a judicially enforceable right to support from their natural fathers and at the same time deny that right to illegitimate children).

In his second equal protection argument as to the child (which he cannot sustain as he has no standing), the appellant poses the rhetorical question, “What is morally, ethically and legally proper?”, and answers it in a utopian fashion. “[T]he child has the right to know his true father, the courts and society have a right to have the trae, responsible party support the child, the various parties to the actions must have their constitutional rights protected and the court must use the best methods available to insure that the Due Process rights of all parties are protected.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 9.) In the real world, the children born of these unions are not conceived in moral or ethical relationships and frequently their lives are well underway before the issue of paternity comes to a head. It is ironic that the appellant would apply “moral” and “ethical” considerations in this fashion which across the wide spectrum of cases would have unpredictable and often catastrophic results to the child. The child has, in most cases, bonded to the persons who asserted their paternity or relationship and the destruction of that psychological identity is frequently devastating. In a substantial number of eases the alleged (biological) father wants to intrude despite the continuing intact relationship of the husband and wife and by law is considered not to have standing to do so even when proof of paternity is absolute. <em>See Michael H., supra.</em>

It held that although the California statute is phrased in terms of a presumption, it expresses a <em>substantive </em>rule of law declaring it to be generally <em>irrelevant </em>for paternity purposes whether a child conceived during and born into an existing marriage was begotten by someone other than the husband, based on the state legislature’s determination as a matter of overriding social policy that the husband should be held responsible for the child and the integrity and privacy of the family unit should not be impugned. Nor did the Supreme Court find the presumption infringed upon any constitutional right of the child, Victoria, to maintain a relationship with her natural father by a claim of equal protection on the basis she had no opportunity to rebut the presumption as did the parents. The state’s decision to treat Victoria differently than her parents has a rational basis in the legitimate end of preventing the disruption of an otherwise peaceful union by the reasonable means of not allowing anyone but the husband or wife to contest legitimacy. Since the child has no standing to rebut the presumption, no constitutional right to equal protection may be asserted on its behalf by appellant or a third party. <em>Michael H., supra </em>at 131, <a href="/us/491/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="491 U.S. 110" data-case-ids="6211101" data-case-paths="/us/491/0110-01">109 S.Ct. 2333</a>, <a href="/us/491/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="491 U.S. 110" data-case-ids="6211101" data-case-paths="/us/491/0110-01">105 L.Ed.2d at 111</a>.</p>

Traditionally, the answer to this question has been that the presumption applies if the child was conceived or born during the marriage. We now question the wisdom of this application of the presumption because the nature of male-female relationships appears to have changed dramatically since the presumption was created. There was a time when divorce was relatively uncommon and marriages tended to remain intact. Applying the presumption whenever the child was conceived or born during the marriage, therefore, tended to promote the policy behind the presumption: the preservation of marriages. Today, however, separation, divorce, and children born during marriage to third party fathers is relatively common, and it is considerably less apparent that application of the presumption to all cases in which the child was conceived or born during the marriage is fair. Accordingly, consistent with the ever-present guiding principle of our law, eessante ratione legis eessat et ipsa lex,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> we hold that the presumption of paternity applies in any case where the policies which underlie the presumption, stated above, would be advanced by its application, and in other cases, it does not apply.</blockquote>

Robert and Carol separated in October of 1995, immediately after learning that Robert was not the biological father of the child, albeit approximately thirteen months after the birth of the child.

In other words, we must view the particular facts of each case to determine whether the presumption of paternity should apply, without blind application of the presumption simply because the child was born during the marriage.

In light of the social and scientific changes in our modern society, the presumption appears archaic. No longer does a child born out-of-wedlock suffer the social (and economic) stigma of illegitimacy. Neither does divorce carry the social stigma it once did. Significantly, recent advances in blood testing can identify with a certainty the biological father of a child. I do not believe all parties concerned, including the child, should be prevented from knowing the identity of the true biological father, a fact which the mother often knows without blood testing, but which she may conceal, and, more importantly, a fact which has such significant psychological and economic impact upon all involved. The presumption of paternity should be abandoned in favor of the more flexible approach set forth in Justice Nigro’s concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Brinkley, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">701 A.2d at 182-183</a>, wherein he states:</p>
