However, the EPA did not abolish regulation of mercury emissions from oil- and coal-fired EGUs. Rather, it shifted the responsibility for the mechanics of the regulation to the states. To accomplish this shifting to the states, the EPA promulgated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (“CAMR”). <a href="/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028606" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="70 Fed.

CAMR was predicated on the Delisting Rule and it established a mercury emission budget for each state and required each state to develop a program to regulate the mercury emissions emanating from oil- and coal-fired EGUs. For Pennsylvania, the EPA allocated a mercury emission budget of 1.78 tons per year for the years 2010 to 2017. Starting in 2018, Pennsylvania’s mercury emission budget would fall to 0.702 tons per year.</p>

Thus, the court determined that the De-listing Rule was unlawful and vacated it, the effect of which was that EGUs remain listed under Section 112.

Judge Pellegrini reasoned that given the DC Circuit Court’s decision in <em>New Jersey, </em>the Delisting Rule and CAMR are invalid and EGUs remained listed under Section 112. Therefore, the Board did not have the authority to promulgate the PA Mercury Rule. Judge Pellegrini emphasized that his conclusion was not altered by the fact that the PA Mercury Rule was promulgated during that interim period between promulgation of the Delisting Rule and CAMR and the DC Circuit Court’s invalidation of those rules. He reasoned that because the DC Circuit Court had found that the Delisting Rule and CAMR were void <em>ab initio, </em>the EGUs must be deemed to have been always listed. Judge Pellegrini declared the PA Mercury Rule invalid and he enjoined the Commonwealth from continued implementation or enforcement of the PA Mercury Rule.
