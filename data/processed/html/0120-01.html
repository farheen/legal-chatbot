    <p id="b177-10" data-blocks='[["BL_177.9",177,[188,1074,752,848]]]'>Benjamin F. Button appeals from the entry of a summary judgment in the Superior Court (Oxford County, <em>Alexander, J.) </em>in favor of Peoples Heritage Savings Bank on Benjamin’s breach of contract action. Benjamin contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that a summary judgment was inappropriate because he had raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Bank breached its contract with him when it allowed redemption of a certificate of deposit issued in the joint names of Benjamin and his mother, Blanche Button. Because the dispositive issues in this case have been decided against Benjamin in a decision by the Oxford County Probate Court, he is collaterally estopped from relit-igating those issues in this action. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b177-11" data-blocks='[["BL_177.10",177,[190,1945,749,468]],["BL_177.11",177,[989,246,748,235]]]'>In July 1987, Oxford Bank &amp; Trust<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> issued a certificate of deposit with a face value of $30,000 in the names of Blanche and Benjamin Button.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In August 1987, the Bank was contacted by Wilbur Button, Blanche’s son and brother to Benjamin. Wilbur informed the Bank that Blanche wished both to redeem the certificate and obtain a check for its proceeds. In response to this request, the Bank prepared a cheek payable to “Blanche Button either/or Benjamin F. Button.” The Bank gave the check to Wilbur for delivery to his mother. The Bank did not contact Blanche or Benjamin prior to preparing the check and delivering it to Wilbur.</p>
    <p id="b177-15" data-blocks='[["BL_177.15",177,[987,521,750,468]]]'>The check subsequently was endorsed as follows: “Pay to the order of Ella T. Button /s/ Blanche H. Button.” Ella Button is Wilbur’s wife and was a daughter-in-law to Blanche. The check then was presented at Key Bank of Maine with this endorsement. Oxford Bank &amp; Trust, having determined to its satisfaction that the check was properly endorsed by Blanche, honored the check as drawee. Blanche died a few weeks later.</p>
    <p id="b177-16" data-blocks='[["BL_177.16",177,[986,1036,750,669]]]'>Following Blanche’s death, Benjamin filed a petition in the Oxford County Probate Court seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>to determine title to and proper disposition of the certificate of deposit. Benjamin alleged that the redemption of the $30,000 certificate of deposit was not his mother’s act, that her signature on the check had been forged, and, to the extent that she participated in the redemption of the certificate, that her actions were unduly influenced by her other son and her daughter-in-law. After a full hearing, the Probate Court <em>(Morton, J.) </em>decided those issues against Benjamin.</p>
    <p id="b177-17" data-blocks='[["BL_177.17",177,[985,1744,749,660]]]'>The court concluded that Blanche’s signature was not a forgery, that all of Blanche’s actions in arranging her financial affairs were “voluntary, free of duress or undue influence” and “the actions and decisions of a competent person.” The court found that Blanche, although originally investing in the certificate to benefit Benjamin, finally intended to cash it, thus terminating Benjamin’s ownership interest, and to use its proceeds to pay for her own long-term health care. The court determined that the proceeds were being held in trust by Ella Button and were assets of Blanche’s estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Benjamin argues that he is not prevented from proceeding on his breach of contract claim by the doctrine of collateral estoppel with respect to the determinations made by the Probate Court. First, he contends that the Probate Court decision is not a final judgment. Additionally, he argues that there are facts that are material and remain in dispute and were not addressed by or essential to the Probate Court decision: whether his mother ever issued a request for the certificate of deposit’s redemption; whether the endorsement by Blanche of the proceeds check was ever penned by her or, rather, was made by a stamp; whether Blanche was competent at the time the certificate was redeemed; and whether the issue of Blanche’s competence was ever litigated before the Probate Court.</p>

We disagree. It is clear that Blanche, as a joint owner of the certificate, had a right to redeem it and thus terminate Benjamin’s interest. Whether Blanche intended to redeem the certificate and thus terminate Benjamin’s interest was central to Benjamin’s petition in the Probate Court to determine title to the certificate. In that action he contended that Blanche did not endorse the proceeds check and that her actions were unduly influenced. The court concluded otherwise, finding that Blanche signed the check and was competent and free from undue influence. The court had to address those issues in order to determine that title to the certificate was in the estate, and not with Benjamin.</p>

Benjamin had his day in court. Accordingly, the Superior Court correctly granted the motion for a summary judgment.</p>
