We are called upon to review a report of the Board of Professional Responsibility (“Board”) directed to charges of professional misconduct against the Respondent, Joseph E. Funk (“Funk”), a member of the Delaware Bar. This Court temporarily suspended Funk from the practice of law on September 29, 1997. At that time, Funk had been charged by federal authorities with “serious crimes” and was incarcerated. This Court concluded that Funk “pose[d] a substantial threat of irreparable harm to his clients, prospective clients, other members of the public and the orderly administration of justice.” The Court of Chancery immediately appointed a receiver for Funk’s law practice.</p>
    <p id="b898-17" data-blocks='[["BL_898.17",898,[1006,947,751,1030]]]'>The Court has before it the Board’s Final Report (“Report”) and recommendation. The Board proceeding followed Funk’s plea of guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited user (an unlawful drug user) in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g)(3). In its Report, the Board concluded that Funk’s conviction for felony possession of a firearm constituted a “serious crime” under Board Rule 16(c) and was conclusive on the issue of a violation of the Delaware Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board further determined that, given the presence of substantial aggravating factors and the absence of any mitigating factors, the severity of Funk’s misconduct warranted disbarment. We agree with the Board’s conclusions and the recommendation of disbarment.</p>
