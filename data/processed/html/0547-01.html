Petitioner sought benefits for emotional injuries which she allegedly sustained while she was employed by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in a program in which she was assigned to work at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At the administrative hearing on her claim, petitioner asserted that stressful working conditions at the EPA had caused her severe physical and emotional problems, including depression, anxiety, headaches, and diarrhea, and had aggravated the hypertension from she was previously suffering. The DOES hearing <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>examiner concluded that there was “nothing unusual” about petitioner’s employment at the EPA which would have caused these ailments (or aggravated the existing hypertension) in an average person, that petitioner was “predisposed” to depression, and that only a person so predisposed would have been adversely affected by the work environment at the EPA. Consequently, the hearing examiner denied petitioner’s claim for benefits, and the Director of DOES affirmed that denial. Before this court petitioner contends that the hearing examiner and the Director misapplied the legal standard governing the compensability of employment-related emotional injuries, made inadequate factual findings, and misapplied the presumption of compensability contained in our workers’ compensation statute. Finding these contentions to be without merit, we affirm.</p>

Ms. Sturgis was assigned to the Chemical Screening Branch of the EPA’s Office of Toxic Substances. At the hearing below she testified that, from her first day on the job, the conditions of her employment at the EPA caused her to experience significant stress, which she attributed to a variety of sources. It stemmed, in part, from the fact that she was inadequately trained for her duties and was given work which she felt was demeaning. For example, she testified that on the day she began work the office secretary started a two-week vacation. As a result, Ms. Sturgis was left alone in the office with no guidance as to office procedures and was given responsibility for work ordinarily done by the secretary. Her stress also resulted, in part, from the fact that she was criticized for poor work performance. On this point she testified that the branch chief of her office frequently left notes on her desk which were unfairly critical of her work, spoke to her in a condescending fashion, and refused to give her work assignments commensurate with her job description and professional skills.</p>
    <p id="b599-7" data-blocks='[["BL_599.7",599,[1027,362,747,794]]]'>Ms. Sturgis testified that her health began to deteriorate after she had worked about six weeks at the EPA. In her view, the stressful circumstances of her employment caused a variety of emotional problems, such as depression, memory loss, exhaustion, “anxiety attacks,” and a general inability to “cope with anything.” This stress, she said, had physical symptoms as well, including headaches and diarrhea, and aggravated her existing hypertension. She attributed these problems entirely to the stress she felt while working at the EPA. She testified that, because of these problems, she has been unable to work since her separation from employment at the EPA.</p>

Written reports from all four of these persons were introduced into evidence at the administrative hearing.</p>

Dr. Gaitor did not express any opinion, however, as to whether there was any causal relationship between her condition and her employment at the EPA; indeed, he gave no opinion at all concerning the cause of her condition. Dr. Judith Nowak, a psychiatrist, concluded that Ms. Sturgis was suffering from a “major depressive disorder,” but concluded that this disorder did not arise out of her employment at the EPA. Another psychiatrist, Dr. José Marco T. Antonio, was of the view that Ms. Sturgis suffered from “anxiety-depressive reaction with poor coping mechanism,” coupled with “essential hypertension.” The hypertension, he said, “may have been aggravated by stress at work,” <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>but that stress was “not the cause of her elevated blood pressure reading.” Finally, Craig Uehiyama, a psychology intern at Howard University Hospital, opined that Ms. Sturgis exhibited symptoms of both depression and a delusional disorder, and concluded that she required “long-term ego-supportive psychotherapy.” Mr. Uchi-yama, like Dr. Gaitor, did not express an opinion as to whether there was any causal relationship between her condition and her employment at the EPA.</p>

Jack Everett, the field coordinator for the employment program at AARP through which Ms. Sturgis was placed at the EPA, testified about her performance problems at the EPA and the events surrounding her eventual termination. Also testifying on the employer’s behalf was Dr. Brian Schulman, a psychiatrist who examined Ms. Sturgis in July 1990 at the employer’s request. Dr. Schulman concluded that Ms. Sturgis was not clinically depressed, that she did not have any cognitive or mental deficiency, and that she was not “functionally or organically impaired,” <em>i.e., </em>that she did not suffer from an “active, acute psychiatric illness.” He did conclude, however, that Ms. Sturgis had “a volatile temper” and that she might have a “borderline personality disorder with paranoid features,” causing her to have “difficulty modulating her internal aggression and [to become] very angry and enraged with perhaps little provocation.” He testified further that “most of [her] intense visceral or behavioral, emotional reactions were generated out of her personality” and were triggered by normal everyday events of office life, “things that might happen in a busy office.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On the basis of these findings, he concluded that Ms. Sturgis’ work at the EPA did not, from a medical standpoint, cause the emotional problems about which she had testified.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Citing an earlier DOES case, <em>Dailey v. 3M Co., </em>H &amp; AS No. 85-259 (May 19, 1988), the examiner said that for an emotional injury to be compensable, whether it is a new injury or an aggravation of a pre-existing condition, “the claimant must show that the actual conditions of employment as determined by an objective standard, and not merely the claimant’s subjective perception of her working conditions, were the cause of her emotional injury.” After briefly summarizing the medical evidence, the examiner concluded that this evidence established that Ms. Sturgis “was predisposed to depression” and that “there was nothing unusual or uncommon about [her] work conditions which would cause a person not predisposed to become stressed.” Thus the hearing examiner held that Ms. Sturgis’ claim was not compensable because “her current condition did not arise out of and in the course of [her] employment.”</p>

She contends first that the findings are inconsistent and incorrectly interpret the medical evidence. This contention is based on the mistaken belief that the compensation order fails to reconcile Ms. Sturgis’ testimony that she was “harassed” with the examiner’s conclusion that “[n]othing unusual or uncommon happened at [Ms. Sturgis’] employment which led to her current depression.” The hearing examiner’s decision to credit the factual content of Ms. Sturgis’ testimony did not bind her to conclude that the things that happened to Ms. Sturgis at the EPA constituted “harassment.” In any event, whether the acts of which she complained amounted to “harassment” was irrelevant to the compensation decision because compensability does not depend on “the claimant’s subjective perception of [her] working condi<a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>tions-” <em>Spartin, supra, </em><a href="/a2d/584/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="584 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="7388904" data-case-paths="/a2d/584/0564-01">584 A.2d at 568</a> (quoting <em>Dailey, supra, </em>at 5).</p>

The employee asserted that, after the company for which he worked had merged with a larger firm, his job responsibilities grew to unmanageable proportions. He claimed that the pressure he experienced as a result of these new duties left him severely depressed, and that this depression manifested itself in suicidal thoughts, despondency, loss of memory, and an inability to concentrate. This court held that "emotional injuries" such as those suffered by Mr. Spartin were compensable under the workers’ compensation act under certain circumstances.

In any event, it is doubtful that Ms. Sturgis’ pre-existing conditions were in fact aggravated by the stress she experienced at work. Her medical evidence established that she suffered from depression, a type of personality disorder. Dr. Schulman testified that a personality disorder stays with a person throughout his or her entire life, so that work-related stress cannot, in a medical sense, aggravate it. The doctor said that stress may appear to aggravate a pre-exist-ing personality disorder because, "when people are under conditions of stress, deficits in their personality will manifest themselves. [However, the underlying] condition doesn’t get worse." Similarly, there was substantial evidence that Ms. Sturgis’ hypertension was not aggravated by the job stress she experienced. Dr. Schulman explained that hypertension is a disease and that, as such, it "is not made worse by life stress or by exacerbation; it's a blood pressure_ [T]here's no scientific evidence that the disease is either aggravated or accelerated in its progression by the course of — by any life event or stressful event."</p>
