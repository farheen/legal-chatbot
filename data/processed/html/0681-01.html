Pursuant to appellees’ summary judgment motions, the trial court either dismissed or deferred the complaints of appellants, Mary Taylor, Jimmy and Madeline Watkins, husband and wife, John F. and Kathleen Meehan, husband and wife, Robert and Margaret Riffert, husband and wife, and James and Pauline Yelloek, husband and wife. We hold that the trial court was correct to dismiss Ms. Taylor’s complaint and defer the Watkins’, the Mee-hans’, and the Rifferts’ complaints. We further hold, however, that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against the Yellocks pursuant to appellees’ oral summary judgment motion on the morning of trial without allowing the Yellocks adequate time to respond to the motion. Thus, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>

Decedent was employed at the Budd Company from 1944 to 1976 as a crane and fork lift truck operator. Decedent was allegedly diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases and pulmonary thickening on November 24, 1986. During his lifetime, decedent remained asymptomatic and the record indicates that as of April, 1987, after a pulmonary evaluation, William Fineman, M.D. detected no physical manifestations of asbestosis. Medical reports also established that decedent had a smoking history of approximately twenty-five to forty-five years. Four months later, on August 5, 1987, decedent died due to metastic bladder cancer, which was not related to the pleural thickening. Pursuant to appellees’ motion for summary judgment, on January 5, 1994, Judge Sabo dismissed appellant Mary Taylor’s complaint. <em>Appellants Jimmy and Madeline Watkins</em>

Appellant-husband was initially exposed to asbestos in 1954 when he worked as a longshoreman and later in 1960 when he worked for the Budd Company as a pressman until 1980. Appellant-husband was allegedly diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease on August 13, 1987 and in 1993, complained of shortness of breath when ascending two flights of stairs. A medical examination, however, diagnosed appellant-husband with pleural thickening, not asbestosis. The medical exam further revealed that appellant-husband is obese with high blood pressure and heart abnormalities. At the time of trial, <a id="p685" href="#p685" data-label="685" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*685</a>appellant-husband exhibited only shortness-of breath. On January 5, 1994, appellees moved for a deferral and Judge Sabo granted the motion.

During the course of appellant-husband’s employment at the Budd Company from 1965 to 1980, he was exposed to asbestos. Appellants allege that appellant-husband was diagnosed with asbestosis on December 9, 1987. According <em>to </em>Jonathan Gelfand, M.D., however, as of May 6, 1993, appellant-husband suffered only from pleural thickening rather than asbestosis. Appellant-husband currently suffers from shortness of breath. Furthermore, Dr. Gel-fand stated in a medical report that appellant-husband suffered head injuries and smoked for several years. But, it is unclear whether the shortness of breath is attributable to the head trauma, smoking, or an asbestos-related disease. On January 5, 1994, appellees moved for a deferral of the case pui’suant to <em>Giffear v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>and Judge Sabo granted the motion.</p>

Appellant-husband was initially exposed to asbestos in 1956 when he worked as an assembler for' I.T.E. Circuit Breaker and later from 1961 to 1980 when he was employed as a welder at the Budd Company. Appellants’ complaint sets forth that appellant-husband was diagnosed with asbestosis on July'31, 1987. The record, however, reflects that appellant-husband has no symptoms of asbestosis, not even shortness of breath and that appellant-husband suffers only from pleural thickening rather than asbestosis. <em>See </em>N.T. 1/5/94 at 10. Appellant-husband’s only medical problem is an obstruction of his lungs, attributable to his smoking habit which he continued as of January 5, 1994. Based on appellant-husband’s lack of physical symptoms, appellees moved for dismissal under <em>Giffear v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>on January 5, 1994.

Each of these appellants premise their argument on their belief that this Court wrongly decided <em>Giffear v.

Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>is affirmed by the Supreme Court, their cases do not fall under the standard set forth by that case. In the cases of the Watkinses and the Rifferts, however, the appeal relies solely on the premise that <em>Giffear v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>will be reversed and it is conceded that if that case is affirmed, their cases were correctly dismissed and placed on the inactive list. Furthermore, the Yellocks contend that the trial court erred in granting appellees’ motion for summary judgment. The Yellocks assert two arguments in support of this position; first, the trial judge incorrectly allowed appellees’ summary judgment motion to be heard because it was untimely and second, the trial judge erred in granting appellees’ motion because the motion was devoid of merit.</p>

Furthermore, appellees orally moved for summary judgment rather than <em>filing </em>the motion. This certainly does not comport with the Pa.R.Civ.P. 1035(a) requirement that a moving party <em>file </em>a motion for summary judgment. The Yellocks repeatedly requested the opportunity to depose witnesses and prepare affidavits in response to appellees’ motion. <em>See </em>N.T. 1/5/94 at 47, 48, 55, 56, 64-65. As a result of the trial judge’s refusal to allow the Yellocks to respond to appellees’ motion, the Yellocks were effectively denied notice and an opportunity to argue effectively against the motion. Certainly, it was not the intention of the drafters of Pa.R.Civ.P. 1035 to preclude a non-moving party a full and fair opportunity to respond to a summary judgment motion. Accordingly, we conclude that Judge Sabo erred by granting appellees’ motion for summary judgment with regard to the Yellocks.</p>
