They were domiciled in the District of Columbia before and after marriage, but were married in Virginia. In both Virginia and the District of Columbia the minimum age for marriage is 18 years for males and 16 years for females.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In order to obtain his father’s consent appellant falsely represented that appellee was pregnant, and in order to obtain the Virginia marriage license appellant falsely certified that he was 18 years of age and that she was 17 years of age. After marriage the parties returned to the District and lived together in their own home as man and wife for about six months and then separated. About nine months after the separation appellant, through his uncle as next friend, brought this action to annul the marriage on the ground that at time of marriage both parties were under the age of consent. The wife did not oppose the action. At trial appellant and his uncle were the only witnesses. After hearing the testimony the trial court ruled that appellant was not entitled to a decree of annulment, and this appeal is from that holding.</p>

The court held the doctrine of “clean hands” had no application, that the marriage was “void by law, and the courts have no alternative when the matter is presented, either directly or collaterally, in any matter in which it becomes an issue, but to declare it so.” This ruling was followed in Frey v.

In other words, the first class of marriages is void and the second merely voidable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus we have two classes of illegal marriages, one declared void from the beginning and without any standing in law, whose nullity may be shown and must be recognized in any proceeding. For the purposes of this case we may assume that a court has no discretion whatever, regardless of circumstances, in declaring such marriage void. Marriages of the second class, including the marriage here involved, although forbidden are not void until so declared by court decree. These marriages therefore have a degree of validity and the courts are not compelled under all circumstances to declare them void. For example, one, fully capable of contracting a marriage, who knowingly and willfully contracts a marriage with one under age or with a lunatic has no standing to have that marriage declared a nullity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> And if parties under age contract marriage and voluntarily cohabit after coming of age, such marriage will not be declared void.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
