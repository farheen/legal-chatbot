Goldsmith, appeals from his Superior Court jury convictions of possession with intent to deliver a narcotic schedule I controlled substance, possession of a narcotic schedule I controlled substance, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. It is defendant’s contention that his car was improperly stopped; that his car was searched in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section Six of the Delaware Constitution, and that the Trial Court erred by admitting evidence of drugs and evidence of a physical attack by defendant upon a witness subpoenaed for trial.</p>

On this occasion the detectives’ attention was focused on a Buick automobile which struck a car parked to its rear with such force that the officers observed the other car move in a rocking type motion. The driver of the Buick then abruptly pulled out of the parking space without stopping to check for damage. Suspecting that the driver was intoxicated the officers followed the Buick to determine if the driver was capable of operating it.</p>

Detective Sapp ordered the driver, Marcus Goldsmith, and the other male occupant, Michael Murray, out of the car. Being afraid that Murray may have placed a gun between the backrest and seat, he felt that for his safety and his partner’s safety he should determine what was there. As Detective Sapp tried to reach into the back seat, two of the three females remaining in the car pushed and pulled him away. After removing them from the car he reached into the back seat where he had observed Murray concealing an object and pulled out a plastic bag containing glassine packets. While performing a weapon pat-down of the defendant and Murray, Detective Sines found additional plastic bags containing glassine packets. All totaled, the bags contained 224 small glassine packets of a clear white powder later determined by the Medical Examiner’s office to be heroin.</p>

Thus, the permissibility of a particular law-enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Implemented in this manner, the reasonableness standard usually requires, at a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion is based be capable of measurement against ‘an objective standard,’ whether this be probable cause or a less stringent test. In those situations in which the balance of interests precludes insistence upon ‘some quantum of individualized suspicion,’ other safeguards are generally relied upon to asshre that the individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy is not ‘subject to the discretion of the official in the field,’ <em>Ca-</em>

But Detective Sapp testified that it had been his experience that a person under the influence of either drugs or alcohol has extreme difficulty in parking a car. The availability of alcohol in the neighborhood and the officer’s experience, together with the officers’ observation of defendant’s backing into a parked car and abrupt driving off without stopping to check for damage, were sufficient objective criteria to have given the officers an “articulable and reasonable suspicion” that defendant was intoxicated.
