Prince was also convicted of carrying a pistol without a license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Of the numerous arguments presented to us in the two appellants’ consolidated appeals, we address in detail only Prince’s claims that the trial court committed reversible error by denying his motion for severance of defendants, that the prosecutor improperly invoked the “missing witness” doctrine against him, that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and that he was improperly sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Although we find some merit in Prince’s contentions with respect to the “missing witness” issue, we conclude that, on the particular facts of this case, reversal is not required. We find Prince’s other principal contentions to be plausible but, on balance, unpersuasive, and Ms. Lemon’s claims to be meritless.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Accordingly, we affirm both appellants’ convictions.</p>

Many of the members of both groups had been drinking alcohol or using drugs or both. Unsurprisingly, there were numerous contradictions and incongruities in the testimony (most of them on collateral issues) which Prince’s appellate counsel was able to bring out skillfully in her brief. Nevertheless, the principal events of the night in question emerge with reasonable clarity from the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b1447-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1447.14",1447,[958,356,750,1123]]]'>According to the prosecution’s evidence, Ms. Lemon was at her sister's house on the evening of March 30, 1984 with her friend Pamela Givens. At about midnight, she left for a short period. Upon her return, she persuaded Ms. Givens to join her in riding around in a van with two young men, later identified as Prince and his friend Reginald Nelson. The four of them eventually drove to a service station, where they encountered five of the other six <em>dra-matis personae, </em>namely Phyllis Chesley, Beverly Portier, Garland Thames, Melvin Howard and Marion Foster. Following some discussion among the nine persons now present, of whom some knew each other and some did not, all of them trav-elled in the van for a few blocks to 242 Oakland Street, S.E., where Ms. Chesley, Ms. Portier and Melvin Howard all lived. They were met there by Melvin Howard’s brother James, and they all went into the hosts’ apartment, ostensibly to play cards, drink and socialize.</p>
    <p id="b1447-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1447.15",1447,[958,1507,752,896]]]'>The party had hardly been launched when Prince suddenly pulled out a pistol and appellants announced a stick-up. They ordered all of the persons (except for their two original companions) to strip. Prince fired a shot into the wall, hitting nobody. He also struck Thames, an elderly man, in the head with the butt of his weapon. Ms. Lemon went through the victims’ valuables and clothing, and she and Prince carried away a T.Y. set and a number of other items, including the victims’ clothes. Although there was some suggestion that they may have acted as lookouts, Ms. Givens and Nelson were for the most part depicted as passive spectators in the proceedings, neither participating in the intimidation and expropriation of the victims nor doing anything to assist them.</p>

After some incomplete sexual dalliances among the participants and the purchase and consumption of some cocaine, Prince gave the women the remaining proceeds of the robbery.</p>
    <p id="b1448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1448.5",1448,[199,677,750,739]]]'>The victims made no immediate report of the crime after the robbers had left. Early on the following afternoon, however, Ms. Portier and Melvin Howard saw the gunman operating the van in which they had travelled on the previous day and called the police. Officers responded and stopped two vans, only to learn from the witnesses that neither vehicle was involved in the robbery. After a third van was stopped, however, Ms. Portier and Howard identified both the van and the driver, who turned out to be Benny Prince. Prince was arrested, the identity of Ms. Lemon was subsequently ascertained, and both appellants were indicted, tried and convicted.</p>

She admitted participating in the robbery, which she described as having been unplanned, at least by her. She asserted that she was afraid of the gunman, and relied on a defense of duress. She admitted collecting and retaining the proceeds of the robbery and helping to carry them away. On cross-examination by the prosecutor, she positively identified Prince as the gunman.</p>
    <p id="b1448-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1448.12",1448,[999,446,746,557]]]'>Prince presented defenses of misidentifi-cation and alibi. Marion Foster, one of the victims of the robbery, testified that she was positive that Prince was not the gunman. She stated that she had never seen him before coming to court. Vincent Starks, a federal protective service officer, testified that Prince and one George Cole had arrived at the home of Starks’ girlfriend, Martina Smith, between 11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on the night in question and had remained there for several hours.</p>
    <p id="b1448-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1448.13",1448,[999,1032,746,558]]]'>Prince also testified in his own behalf.

Prince related that he then picked up George Cole and that they both visited the home of Martina Smith, where he remained until 2:30 or 3:00 а.m.

If the jurors believed that Ms. Lemon was in a drug-induced torpor during trial, such a belief would logically have reinforced Prince’s contention that her testimony against him was unreliable.

Prince did not file a motion in the trial court to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial.

The practical result of the failure to file such a motion is that we, as an appellate court, must decide the question without the benefit of findings by the trial judge, who had the case on his calendar for a significant period and must surely have had a better "feel” for it than is available from a cold record. A defendant demanding a speedy trial should not, of course, be content with moving for dismissal and should affirmatively request an early date. <em>See Graves, supra, </em>490 A.2d at 1098. The filing of a motion to dismiss at a time when the trial judge can meaningfully consider it will substantially improve the record available to this court, and is desirable for that reason.</p>
