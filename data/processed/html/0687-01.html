    <p id="b753-29" data-blocks='[["BL_753.25",753,[954,1923,756,181]]]'>The consolidated appeals presented before us for review are taken from a judgment entered against Eastern Engineering and Elevator Company (Eastern).</p>
    <p id="b753-30" data-blocks='[["BL_753.26",753,[954,2133,757,611]]]'>Eastern was a named defendant in an action brought by William and Paula Curran for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of a fall Mr. Curran sustained when a moving escalator on which he was riding in the Sands Hotel and Casino (Sands) came to a sudden stop. The Sands was also named as a defendant with Eastern, who was responsible for maintaining the escalator. A five day jury trial was held after which the jury returned a verdict. The trial court’s interpretation of the jury’s verdict forms the basis for issues presented in the appeals filed in this case.</p>
    <p id="b754-3" data-blocks='[["BL_754.3",754,[204,230,759,1376]]]'>
      <a id="p688" href="#p688" data-label="688" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*688</a>The verdict slip had been prepared with special interrogatories for the jury to consider and answer. The jury responded and found, in answer to questions numbered one and two, that Sands was negligent, but that the negligence of Sands was not a substantial factor in causing harm to plaintiffs. In answering questions numbered three and four, the jury determined that Eastern negligently breached its duties under the maintenance contract, and that Eastern’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs’ harm. The jury next found thát William Curran was not negligent. When asked what percentage of plaintiffs damages should be attributed to the causal negligence of each of the parties, the jury responded by attributing 30% to Sands, and 70% to Eastern. William Curran was assigned a zero percentage figure by the jury. The final question asked “[w]hat damages, if any, do you award plaintiffs?” Appearing next to William Curran’s name was the amount of $301,000.00. A zero was written in the line next to Paula Curran’s name. The trial court subsequently molded the verdict and entered judgment solely against Eastern in the amount of $210,000.00, representing 70% of the $301,000.00 verdict award, plus delay damages.</p>
    <p id="b754-4" data-blocks='[["BL_754.4",754,[203,1634,754,604]]]'>On appeal Eastern sets forth five issues questioning the sufficiency and weight of evidence to support the verdict, the trial court’s evidentiary rulings and the need for a new trial due to inconsistency in the jury verdict. The Currans, in addition to refuting these claims, have filed their own appeal alleging that the trial court erred in molding the verdict thereby precluding them from receiving the entire $301,000.00 verdict award, and that the court erred by failing to make an additur for Paula Curran’s damage claim based on loss of consortium.</p>
    <p id="b754-5" data-blocks='[["BL_754.5",754,[199,2273,756,466]],["BL_754.6",754,[1010,229,751,132]]]'>After reviewing the record in light of the issues presented, we conclude that all of the issues with the exception of those questions concerning the jury verdict, and the court’s action with respect to that verdict, can be readily dismissed. The trial court, in its opinion written in response to the parties’ post-trial motions, has thoroughly discussed these matters and, for the reasons provided therein, we conclude that the trial court correctly found the issues to be without merit. We turn now to the remaining matter of the jury verdict.</p>
    <p id="b754-7" data-blocks='[["BL_754.7",754,[1007,384,755,979]]]'>Eastern argues that the court’s decision with respect to the verdict should be reversed and a new trial ordered because the answers given by the jury to the specific interrogatories were inconsistent. Eastern maintains that these inconsistencies are irreconcilable, and demonstrate jury confusion on the issue of causation, thus necessitating a new trial. In response, the Currans and Sands argue that this claim was waived by Eastern when it failed to object at the time the jury rendered its verdict. While disputing Eastern’s contention that a new trial is warranted, the Currans nevertheless urge us to disturb the trial court’s decision which molded the verdict and allowed William Cur-ran to recover only 70% of the $301,000.00 jury award. The Currans suggest that a decision which precludes William Curran from recovering the entire jury verdict is in error.</p>
    <p id="b754-8" data-blocks='[["BL_754.8",754,[1006,1401,754,800]]]'>It is clear from an examination of the jury’s responses to the interrogatories that an interpretation of their answers is troublesome. However, whenever possible we must look to find consistency in a jury’s verdict. “It is well established law in Pennsylvania that there is a presumption of consistency with respect to a jury’s findings which can only be defeated when there is no reasonable theory to support the jury’s verdict.” <em>Giovanetti v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em><a href="/pa-super/372/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="372 Pa. Super. 431" data-case-ids="693703" data-case-paths="/pa-super/372/0431-01">372 Pa.Super. 431</a>, 440, <a href="/pa-super/372/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="372 Pa.

Thus, we must examine the jury verdict to determine whether this presumption of consistency may stand. A similar undertaking was conducted in <em>Goldmas v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/393/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="393 Pa. Super. 245" data-case-ids="877829" data-case-paths="/pa-super/393/0245-01">393 Pa.Super. 245</a>, <a href="/pa-super/393/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="393 Pa.

    <p id="b754-9" data-blocks='[["BL_754.9",754,[1001,2224,754,516]],["BL_755.1",755,[153,229,753,707]]]'>In <em>Goldmas </em>the jury determined that the defendant was negligent and that the defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiffs harm. It further found that the plaintiff was not contribu-torily negligent, but attributed defendant with 75%, rather than 100% of the causal negligence. The plaintiff was not assigned any percentage figure for causal negligence. The court found certain consistencies in the jury’s verdict. It ruled that there was “no <a id="p689" href="#p689" data-label="689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*689</a>question as to the jury’s finding that [the defendant] was negligent, and that the negligence of [the defendant] was a proximate cause of [the plaintiffs] damages.” <em>Goldmas, </em>at 252, <a href="/pa-super/393/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="393 Pa. Super. 245" data-case-ids="877829" data-case-paths="/pa-super/393/0245-01">574 A.2d at 104</a>. It farther found that there was “no confusion” concerning the jury’s finding that plaintiff was not contributorily neghgent. Because the jury consistently rejected the defense of contributory negHgence, the <em>Goldmas </em>court concluded that the 75% figure was “mere surplus-age” which had “no effect on the valid verdict rendered by the jury.” <em><a href="/pa-super/393/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="393 Pa. Super. 245" data-case-ids="877829" data-case-paths="/pa-super/393/0245-01">Id.</a> </em>The court thus permitted plaintiff to recover the entire award from the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b755-4" data-blocks='[["BL_755.4",755,[155,986,753,471]]]'>In the instant case certain inconsistencies are apparent when reading the jury’s responses to the interrogatories; however, it is equally apparent that other matters have been clearly determined by the jury. We can begin by noting that the jury found that Mr. Curran was not contributorily neghgent. Thus an award to William Curran cannot be reduced due to any contributory negHgence on his part.</p>
    <p id="b755-5" data-blocks='[["BL_755.5",755,[155,1499,753,652]]]'>The jury also specified the damages which Mr. Curran was entitled to recover. It found that he should be awarded $301,000.00 plus delay damages for his injuries. This factual finding cannot be disputed since it has been clearly set forth in the verdict rendered by the jury. A decision to alter this award, such as was made by the trial court when it reduced this figure, cannot be upheld because there is no confusion in the jury’s determination that Mr. Curran was entitled to recover the specific sum of $301,000.00 plus delay damages for the injuries he suffered as a result of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b755-6" data-blocks='[["BL_755.6",755,[156,2200,752,325]]]'>Finally, it is also evident that the jury found Eastern hable for Mr. Curran’s injuries. The jury was instructed in this case that the Currans had to estabhsh both negligence and causation in order to recover from the defendants. The court’s charge specifically advised the jurors:</p>
    <blockquote id="b755-7" data-blocks='[["BL_755.7",755,[194,2558,715,180]],["BL_755.8",755,[991,226,714,87]]]'>Now, in order for William Curran and Paula Curran to recover in this case they must show that the defendants’ neghgent conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, and that is what the law recognized as a legal cause.</blockquote>
    <p id="b755-13" data-blocks='[["BL_755.9",755,[955,331,339,33]]]'>N.T. 1/27/92 at 135.</p>
    <p id="b755-14" data-blocks='[["BL_755.10",755,[952,384,756,513]]]'>In accordance with this instruction the jury reviewed the evidence and specifically found that Eastern breached its duties under the maintenance contract and that this negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to Mr. Curran. These answers provided by the jury to the interrogatories submitted to them undisputably estabhsh that the jury concluded that William Curran is entitled to recover from Eastern for his damages.</p>
    <p id="b755-15" data-blocks='[["BL_755.11",755,[953,925,757,744]]]'>What is unclear from the jury’s verdict is the liability of Sands. Although the jury determined that Sands’ was neghgent, unlike Eastern, it was found that Sand’s negligence was not a substantial factor in causing Mr. Curran’s harm. Despite this statement that Sand’s negHgence was not the legal cause for Mr. Curran’s injuries, the jury found that 30% of the damages were attributable to Sands’ “causal negHgence.” The jury also assigned Eastern a figure of only 70% relating to “causal negHgence,” although Eastern was the only party found to be legally responsible for Mr. Curran’s injuries. The jury’s responses to these interrogatories cannot be reconciled.</p>
    <p id="b755-16" data-blocks='[["BL_755.12",755,[955,1696,757,1041]],["BL_756.1",756,[208,228,753,130]]]'>A similar situation existed in the case of <em>Ferrick Excavating v. Senger Trucking, </em><a href="/pa/506/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="506 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1790933" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0181-01">506 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="506 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1790933" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0181-01">484 A.2d 744</a> (1984). The jury in that case when responding to interrogatories found that the defendant was neghgent and that its negHgence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs damages. The plaintiff was found to be contributorily neghgent, but its negHgence was not found to be the proximate cause for the injuries. • As in the instant case, despite a finding that a party’s negHgence was not the legal cause of damages, that party was found to be responsible for a percentage of the damages. In the <em>Ferrick </em>case, the plaintiffs proximate negHgence was found to be 20%. The defendant was assigned an 80% figure for responsibility. When reviewing this verdict, our Supreme Court determined that the answers to the interrogatories “set up an irreconcilable inconsistency between the finding in 4 that Ferrick’s negHgence was not a proximate <a id="p690" href="#p690" data-label="690" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*690</a>cause of the injury and the finding in 5 that Ferrick’s proximate negligence was 20%.” <em>Ferrick, </em>at 187, <a href="/pa/506/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="506 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1790933" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0181-01">484 A.2d at 747</a>.</p>
    <p id="b756-4" data-blocks='[["BL_756.4",756,[204,381,757,694]]]'>Like in <em>Ferrick </em>we must find the jury’s answers to interrogatories to be irreconcilably inconsistent. We cannot explain how the jury could apportion damages between Sands and Eastern after determining that Sands negligence was not the legal cause for Mr. Curran’s injuries, and that only Eastern’s negligence was the substantial factor in causing harm to Mr. Curran. Under such circumstances, where we could do no more than guess at the jury’s thinking, we would ordinarily order a new trial to determine these unanswered questions of responsibility. However, in this case, there is a question of waiver.</p>
    <p id="b756-5" data-blocks='[["BL_756.5",756,[201,1111,758,658]]]'>In the instant case the jury returned its verdict, was polled and then dismissed. The jury was dismissed before any objections or requests for clarification of the obviously inconsistent verdict were made by any party. Immediately after the jury left the room the trial court asked counsel “what does this all mean?” Although counsel were permitted by the court to offer their interpretations and were advised that the court would accept written clarification of their positions regarding the jury verdict, no party, including Eastern who now seeks a new trial, acted before the jury was discharged.</p>
    <p id="b756-6" data-blocks='[["BL_756.6",756,[200,1790,755,219]]]'>Our Supreme Court in, <em>City of Philadelphia v. Gray and Williams v.

The jury’s response to these interrogatories found the SEPTA driver to be negligent, but his negligence was not found to be a substantial factor in plaintiffs accident. Another defendant, a city police officer, was found to be negligent in the operation of his vehicle, and his negligence was found to be a substantial factor in plaintiffs accident. The jury then indicated the percentage of causal negligence of both defendants assigning SEPTA a 25% figure and the city a 75% figure. The jury then went on to conclude that the plaintiff did not suffer a permanent loss of a bodily function and awarded her $20,000.00 in damages of which $18,000.00 was found to be for pain and suffering. The trial court rejected plaintiffs post-trial motions requesting judgment in favor of SEPTA or, in the alternative, a new trial. The trial court found that the jury made consistent findings with regard to SEPTA’s negligence and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff against the city,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and in favor of SEPTA against the plaintiff.</p>

The Supreme Court remarked that the plaintiff raised the issue of the inconsistency of the jury’s answers to the interrogatories for the first time in her post trial motions. Because the plaintiff did not object to the jury’s answers when the verdict was rendered, the court held that the plaintiffs request for a new trial based upon inconsistent verdicts was not preserved for review. Thus the court did not disturb the trial court’s decision refusing to award a new trial “notwithstanding the inconsistency of the jury’s answers to the interrogatories” <em><a href="/pa/534/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="534 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1839702" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0467-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/534/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="534 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1839702" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0467-01">534 Pa. at 478</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="534 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1839702" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0467-01">633 A.2d at 1095</a>. The judgment in favor of SEPTA and in favor of the plaintiff against the city for $2,000.00 was affirmed. This affirmance was based upon waiver despite the apparently inconsistent determination that SEPTA’s negligence was not a substantial factor in plaintiffs accident and the jury’s decision to assign SEPTA a 25% figure when asked to indicate the percentage of casual negligence responsible by the parties.</p>

As the supreme court noted in <em>Dilliplaine, supra, </em>the purpose of an objection is to call the alleged error to the trial court’s attention, and to allow the trial court “the chance to hear argument on the issue and an opportunity to correct error.” <a href="/pa/457/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="457 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="477868" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0255-01">457 Pa. at 257</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="322 A.2d 114">322 A.2d at 116</a>. In this case, the record shows that the trial court and the parties immediately recognized the problem with the verdict. The trial court expressly permitted the parties to save their arguments for the post trial motions, and specifically declined to “bind” the parties at that stage of the proceedings. Under the facts of this case, I do not see how the waiver argument can prevail. <em>See James v. Nolan, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="418 Pa.
