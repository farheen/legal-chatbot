Wietzel thereupon further appealed, thus bringing the question before this court.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[150,427,1321,349]]]'>The subject matter of the invention, which constitutes the issue, is a process for the production of a material called formamide, one of the uses of which is as a raw material in the production of hydro-cyanic acid much used as an insecticide for fumigating citrus trees, ships, rooms, etc. Hydrocyanic acid seems to have an extensive use which is constantly expanding. Formamide appears to have no use as an independent article.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[150,781,1321,749]]]'>We think the testimony in this case establishes the fact that Lacy, a chemist, connected for many years with the Roessler &amp; Hasslacher Chemical Co., and, as such, interested in the synthesis of hydrocyanic acid in the manufacture of which the said company is engaged, did at the time claimed by him in his preliminary statement conceive the invention. His interest in the matter was to produce formamide, not for itself, but for use. in making the hydrocyanic acid. To this end he made chemical studies and calculations which led him to conclude that formamide could be produced by the process of the counts. This conception he disclosed to an associate employee of the company, Dr. E. B. Peck, who is also a chemist. On January 27, 1922, Lacy and Peck collaborated in an experiment which is described with much particularity in their testimony. This experiment was successful and a few days thereafter the process was repeated and the article was again produced.</p>

They show the quantity of raw materials used, the hour and minute of the observations made while the work was proceeding, temperatures, fall in pressure, rate of reaction, rela-' tion between rate of reaction and pressure — in short, as we understand the testimony and exhibits, a practically complete record was kept, and has been filed in the case along with other exhibits.</p>
    <p id="b395-7" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[147,1941,1323,393]]]'>Doctor Lacey had kept copies of these various writings and they substantiate his testimony. He is further substantiated by the evidence of Doctor Peck, his collaborator, as to the activities in January and February, 1922. Dr. Sterling Temple, another of the company’s chemists, testifies that he was made aware of Lacy’s invention some time during January or February, 1922. He does not recall whether his first knowledge of it came from the written reports of Lacy or from Lacy by verbal disclosure.</p>

    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[227,376,1323,295]]]'>Bond’s testimony, taken as a whole, evidences the fact that after1 the disclosure to him, studies were made of different processes for producing hydrocyanic acid, including the use of formamide which involved studies of the production of the latter by the Lacy formula or plan and that in August, 1925, he began <em>“ </em>semicommercial ” production of formamide by such plan oí process.</p>

As a matter of fact the record discloses that there was no commercial use of forma-mide in 1922, nor had it been produced in commercial quantities in the United States, to any great extent, at the time of the taking of the testimony in this case in December, 1926, and January, <em>1921. </em>So far as the record discloses the only production in the United States having a commercial aspect was that by Lacy’s company, under the supervision of Bond, in the latter part of 1925 and early part of 1926.</p>

    <p id="b397-7" data-blocks='[["BL_397.8",397,[149,1349,1324,194]]]'>We do not think this record would justify a conclusion that Lacy had abandoned his invention or that he had secreted it in the sense in which that term is meant to be understood in the administration of the patent laws.</p>
    <p id="b397-8" data-blocks='[["BL_397.9",397,[149,1550,1326,643]]]'>Upon the contrary, the record fairly considered convinces us that the process of manufacturing hydrocyanic acid with formamide as an element was being constantly considered with- a view of determining whether the process involving the use of formamide was economically practicable as compared with other processes. The cost element was of importance, including, of course, the cost of producing formamide itself. The lack of commercial use of formamide undoubtedly had its bearing in causing delay in filing the application. There was no commercial demand for this product, except as it could be used as a raw material for the hydrocyanic acid with which the company, so far as the record shows, was chiefly concerned. Under these circumstances we think the record really affirmatively discloses that there was no abandonment.</p>

Doctor Temple, who had to do with the preparation of the patent application, states that he prepared a first draft about the middle of Octo<a id="p948" href="#p948" data-label="948" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*948</a>ber. He states that the decision to file the application was made “ coincident with the decision to have Mr. Bond put into practice the Lacy invention. This decision was made about August, 1925.” In answer to one question, he fixes the date of the first draft as October 18,1925, which appellant points out was a Sunday. From this appellant argues that the importance of speed was realized and urges the inference that the parties were being spurred by knowledge of the foreign patents to Wietzel. Doctor Temple, however, we think, makes it clear that his first information of any foreign patent to Wietzel was about the middle of November, 1925, and was derived from a title reference in the British Illustrated Journal in which the word “ formamide ” was used, but no process or details were given.</p>

For these reasons, he who first reduces to practice is <em>prima facie the </em>first <em>inventor; but </em>under the law the party first to conceive and disclose an invention may prevail, provided he couples his conception and reduction to practice through evidence of reasonable diligence, thus making the two, in substance and effect, a continuous act. <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Seybold, </em><a href="/f/55/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="55 F. 69" data-case-ids="7852417" data-case-paths="/f/55/0069-01">55 F. 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20C.C.A.%2033" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 C.C.A. 33">5 C.
