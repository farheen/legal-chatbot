We affirm the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b1200-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.17",1200,[1027,440,747,421]]]'>By complaint filed in the District Court, Division of Northern Cumberland, on January 10, 1983, the plaintiff alleged the defendant owed $2,905.31 for goods it had sold and delivered to the defendant, plus $581.10 in accrued interest. The defendant, answering <em>pro se, </em>stated the goods had been delivered late, and he was returning them to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b1200-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.18",1200,[1026,882,747,603]]]'>The plaintiff moved for summary judgment based on the pleadings. A hearing was held on the plaintiffs motion on May 25, 1983, at which both parties appeared, the defendant appearing without counsel. There is no indication in the record that either party requested a recording of the proceedings, pursuant to M.D.C.Civ.R. 76(a), and none was made. On June 7, 1983, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, awarding International Silver Company $2,905.31, plus interest and costs.</p>

The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding “no error of law appears on the record.”</p>
    <p id="b1200-20" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.20",1200,[1025,1811,747,365]]]'>The defendant has retained counsel for his appeal to this court, and argues, apparently for the first time, that the proper party defendant in this action is Slender-world International, Inc. and that the District Court erred in finding the defendant personally liable for that corporation’s debts.</p>

The Superior Court was therefore entirely correct in affirming the judgment.</p>
