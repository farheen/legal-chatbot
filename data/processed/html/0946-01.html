It grants diseretion-ary authority to the court to grant a privilege to a prisoner at the time of sentence or commitment or thereafter.

The statute further provides that the sheriff may refuse to permit prisoners to exercise their privileges to leave the jail for any breach of discipline or other violation of jail regulations.
