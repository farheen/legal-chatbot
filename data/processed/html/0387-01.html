This Court therefore decided that the <em>Halley </em>reasoning should apply. We presumed prejudice and, to afford the appellant the opportunity to pursue issues on appeal, remanded the case for the filing of a 1925(b) statement.</p>

Counsel then filed an <em>Anders </em>brief challenging the sentence. This Court found that we could not address the issue in the <em>Anders </em>brief because of counsel’s failure to preserve the sentencing issue or any other issues in the 1925(b) statement. However, following <em>Halley </em>and <em>West, </em>we remanded the case for the filing of a 1925(b) statement that would preserve issues for review so as to afford the appellant his direct appeal right. <em>Myers, </em><a href="/a2d/897/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="897 A.2d 493" data-case-ids="8425141" data-case-paths="/a2d/897/0493-01">897 A.2d at 496</a>.</p>

    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[217,624,754,889]]]'>¶ 20 The 1925(b) statement and the brief both challenge the sentence but they do so by presenting differing allegations of error. The statement alleges that, while Appellant’s minimum sentences are within the guideline ranges, the máximums imposed on him were “... not necessary to balance the need for punishment with rehabilitation of the appellant.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The statement also seems to complain that the court denied Appellant’s request for concurrent rather than consecutive terms for trespass. By contrast, the <em>Anders </em>brief raises the question of whether the court failed to consider factors relevant to sentencing. The 1925(b) statement therefore did not preserve the sentencing issue which was briefed.</p>

Admittedly, <em>Halley, West, Myers </em>involved situations where there was either no 1925(b) statement filed at all or where the 1925(b) statement listed no issues whatsoever. Moreover, we recognize that the <em>West </em>opinion indicated that it and <em>Halley </em>applied only where counsel completely failed to file a 1925(b) statement, thus resulting in the waiver of all claims. <em>West, </em><a href="/a2d/883/0654-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="883 A.2d 654" data-case-ids="8910086" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0654-01">883 A.2d at 658</a>. However, although counsel in this case did file a statement, the statement did not preserve any of the arguments pursued in the brief. We hold that there is no functional difference between the total absence of a 1925(b) statement <em>(Halley, West </em>and <em>Myers) </em>and one that completely fails to-preserve the issues raised on appeal. Both situations leave an appellant without any ability to pursue a direct appeal.</p>
