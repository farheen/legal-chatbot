Briefly, Allegheny Health, Education, and Research Foundation (“AHERF”), presently a debtor in liquidation under the United States Bankruptcy Code, is a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation which operated hospitals, medical schools, and physicians’ practices. From the late-1980s through the mid-1990s, AHERF management aggressively pursued acquisitions in furtherance of an integrated-delivery-system business model. Ultimately, this plan failed, precipitating the bankruptcy filing. Subsequently, a committee of creditors with authority conferred by federal bankruptcy law (the “Committee”) commenced various causes of action against officers, insiders, and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, LLP (“PwC”), as successor to AHERF’s auditor, Coopers and Lybrand (“C &amp; L”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

For example, the Committee contends that management overstated net income by more than $150 million and net unrestricted assets by more than $240 million in 1997.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> According to the Committee, the objective was to create the impression that management strategy was effective, thus concealing the corporation’s deepening insolvency and facilitating management’s continuation of a ruinous business strategy while thwarting essential, remedial intervention by the board of trustees. <em>See </em>Committee Brief at 14 (“Had Coopers performed its audits in compliance with GAAS, AHERF’s trustees and its creditors could and would have intervened and put a halt to a growth strategy that could not be afforded.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The core factual basis for its defense was the participation of AHERF officers in the asserted fraud, since they provided C &amp; L with false financial statements in the first instance. According to PwC’s theory, such fraud is properly imputed to the officers’ principal, AHERF. PwC then asserted that, regardless of whether or not C &amp; L’s own agents knew that the financial statements were false, where the culpability of the plaintiff (the Committee, standing in AHERF’s shoes) is at least as great as that of the defendant (PwC, standing in C &amp; L’s shoes), the action is barred by <em>in pan delicto potior est conditio defendentis </em>(meaning in a case of equal or mutual fault the position of the defending party is the stronger one). <em>See generally Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v.

In so ruling, the court relied in the first instance on a general rule, deriving from agency-law principles, that fraudulent conduct of a corporate officer is imputed to the corporation if committed in the course of the officer’s employment and for the benefit of the corporation. <em>See AHERF Creditors’ Comm. v.

The court reasoned that the preparation and presentation of financial statements, albeit false ones, to an auditor was within the course of the employment of AHERF’s senior management. Further, it determined that the corporation benefitted, at least in the short term, from the fraudulent conduct of its officers. <em>See AHERF Creditors’ Comm. v.

A principal assumes the risk that the agents it chooses to interact on its behalf with third parties will, when actual or apparent authority is present, bind the principal to the legal consequences of their actions. This is because the principal chooses its agents, has the right to control them, and determines how to characterize its agents’ positions and indicia of authority in manifestations made to third parties. A principal’s incentive systems and other practices may also have the effect of discouraging agents from reporting information that, after the fact, it would have been advantageous for the principal to have known. In contrast, when the third party whose legal relations with the principal are at issue has not dealt with the principal (either directly or through an agent) or has not dealt in good faith, the principal does not bear the risk that its agent may withhold relevant information to serve the agent’s own purposes or those of another person. A principal should not be held to assume the risk that an agent may act wrongfully in dealing with a third party who colludes with the agent in an action that is adverse to the principal. That is, the third party should not benefit from imputing the agent’s knowledge to the principal when the third party has acted wrongfully or otherwise in bad faith.
