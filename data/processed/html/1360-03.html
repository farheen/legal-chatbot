As the suppression court noted in its opinion, the Commonwealth’s witnesses (Lutz, Agent Feathers, Detective Young and Agent Wal-strom) each gave a different version as to what occurred after the task force officers arrived on the scene. Lutz testified that, while he was standing next to his vehicle and while he was sitting in the back of a police cruiser, he was questioned by Agent Feathers and Detective Young as to whether there were illegal narcotics in his vehicle. He also testified that, after being questioned, he told the officers that they could search the vehicle. He was unable to remember whether the vehicle was searched immediately or whether he was given <em>Miranda</em>

Agent Feathers testified that he gave <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Lutz prior to questioning him, that Lutz gave oral and written consent to search the vehicle and that the vehicle was searched after it was driven to the police barracks. Detective Young testified that Lutz was questioned and his vehicle was searched before he arrived on the scene. Accordingly, he was unaware of the circumstances surrounding Lutz’s consent or the search of the vehicle. Agent Walstrom testified that he questioned Lutz while Lutz was standing next to his vehicle. He indicated that he informed Lutz that he wanted to search the vehicle and that Lutz was not required to give his consent to search. He then testified that Lutz gave his consent. He and Agent Feathers searched the vehicle immediately, and the cocaine was seized. Agent Walstrom was unable to recall whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given to Lutz prior to questioning.</p>

He then informed the agents that he purchased the cocaine with money supplied by appellee. Several agents accompanied Lutz to his apartment and instructed him to contact ap-pellee. Lutz telephoned appellee and indicated that he had the cocaine at his apartment. Approximately twenty minutes later, appellee arrived at the apartment, received his share of the cocaine and then left the apartment. Appellee was immediately arrested by the police, and the cocaine was seized.</p>
