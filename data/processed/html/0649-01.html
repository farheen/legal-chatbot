On June 5, 1998, Claimant filed a Penalty Petition alleging that Employer “issued a Notice of Compensation Payable on April 21, 1998, although the injury occurred on September 17, 1994. Athough [Employer] finally issued a Notice of Compensation Payable, benefits were unilaterally cut off on March 2,1998.” On July 13, 1998, Employer filed an Answer denying the allegations in the Penalty Petition. Aso on July 13, 1998, Employer filed a Termination/Suspension Petition alleging that Claimant returned to light duty work on July 4, 1996 with no restrictions and no residuals and that she returned to full-duty work on January 4, 1997 with no restrictions and no residuals.

Claimant stated that, on September 17, 1994, she slipped and fell while walking down a flight of stairs. Claimant explained that she fell forward onto a concrete floor and hit her left hand and left knee. Claimant notified Employer, went to the hospital and was then paid injured on duty benefits for two days. The Employee Injury Report states, in relevant part, that Claimant injured her “left hand and elbow and left knee” and, under the “Part of Body Injured” section of the report, the boxes for “elbow”, “wrist”, “hand” and “knee” are checked. (Vesey Exhibit No. 1). The Emergency Department Record lists Claimant’s chief complaint as “fell, injured hand, knee” and lists the final diagnosis as “left hand/left ant[erior] foreleg contusion.” (Vesey Exhibit No. 1). Aso, a form titled “Referral to City Employee’s Compensation Clinic” states that Claimant fell down and hit her “left hand and elbow and left knee.” (Ves-ey Exhibit No. 2). Aterwards, Claimant returned to full-duty work. Claimant testified that, before this injury, she did not have any problems with her left knee.</p>

One of the inmates began chasing the other one up a flight of stairs, and Claimant was in pursuit. Claimant was at the bottom of the stairs when the inmate being chased pushed the other inmate down the stairs and onto Claimant. Claimant testified that she broke the inmate’s fall and that the inmate fell on the inside of her left leg and knee. Claimant notified Employer, sought medical treatment and missed a day of work. The Employee Injury Report states, in relevant part, that the inmate landed on Claimant’s “left leg on the inside from ankle to knee” and, under the “Part of Body Injured” section of the report, the boxes for “knee”, “lower leg” and “ankle” are checked. (Claimant’s Exhibit No. C-4). The Emergency Department Record states that the physician’s assessment was, in part, “no knee pain” and “knee non tender” and list the diagnosis as “contusion left leg.” (Exhibit D-Krum-2).

    <p id="b699-5" data-blocks='[["BL_699.6",699,[94,408,754,1234]]]'>Due to the nature of her work, Claimant was involved in several other altercations with inmates over the next two years that are not relevant to this case. In April of 1996, Claimant was assigned to be a “rover”. The rover in the prison continuously walks around the outside of the housing areas and the control booth. Claimant testified that this continuous walking and standing caused her left knee to hurt and she began to walk with a limp. On June 14,1996, Claimant experienced severe pain in her left knee and sought medical treatment. Claimant returned to work and her sergeant filled out a new injury report for her left knee and sent her to the City Compensation Clinic. At the clinic, a Dr. Diaz referred Claimant to Seth David Krum, D.O. Dr. Krum treated Claimant and performed physical therapy. Claimant received Injured on Duty benefits from June 14th, 1996 to July 5th, 1996 and then returned to light-duty work performing a job with no inmate contact.</p>

However, Claimant had to go back to the compensation clinic and get permission from Employer for the surgery. At the compensation clinic, Claimant did not see Dr. Diaz, who is the doctor that normally treated her. Rather, Claimant saw Robert Harrington Woodson, M.D., who did not approve the surgery recommended by Dr. Krum. Claimant testified that Dr. Wood-son did not examine her but rather “came into the room and he sat down for an hour and 45 minutes and just did nothing but write on a paper.” (N.T. 4/06/1999, p. 26). Claimant then took this paper to Helen C. Vesey, who is Employer’s Occupational Safety Administrator. Claimant testified that Ms. Vesey “wrote her order across the top canceling out what [Dr. Woodson] wrote and said that I was continued light duty pending second opinion.” (N.T. 4/06/1999, p. 28). A second opinion appointment was scheduled for Claimant, but she missed it because she was sick. Claimant attempted to reschedule, but was told that only the compensation services could reschedule the appointment. However, no one ever did reschedule another appointment.</p>

On March 5, 1998, Claimant went to see Ms. Vesey again and asked to go to the compensation clinic. However, she was informed that she had to have a second opinion appointment. Claimant testified that eventually she was given another appointment with Dr. Woodson and it was her understanding after speaking to a Ms. Streeter at the compensation clinic that she was going to get a referral to Dr. Krum. However, the appointment with Dr. Woodson was similar to the previous one and he released her to full duty. Claimant testified that: “I tried to question [Dr. Woodson] as to whether or not Ms. Street-er had spoke with him, like I was lead [sic] to believe it happened. And he said “no.” That he’s the doctor and nobody tells him what to do.” (N.T. 4/06/1999, pp. 34-35). Apparently, Claimant tried to make an appointment with another doctor, but that doctor would not schedule an appointment without Dr. Woodson’s original release paper and Dr. Woodson would not give Claimant the original. In March of 1998, Claimant was unable to continue working due to left knee pain. She saw Dr. Krum again in July of 1998 at which time her knee did not hurt as much because of her limited activity. Claimant further testified that she wants to return to work and that <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>she wants to undergo the surgery recommended by Dr. Krum.</p>

(N.T. 4/01/1999, p. 26). When asked whether Claimant has fully recovered from her injury, Dr. Woodson replied that:</p>

The WCJ also accepted the testimony of Dr. Krum as more credible and persuasive than the testimony of Dr. Woodson. Based on these credibility determinations, the WCJ found that Claimant sustained a work-related exacerbation of pre-existing joint disease of the left knee on September 17, 1994 and September 27, 1994 and that Employer failed to sustain its burden of proving that Claimant fully recovered from her work injury as <em>of </em>January 4, 1997. Further, the WCJ concluded that Claimant failed to prove that Employer violated the Workers’ Compensation Act (Act).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Accordingly, the WCJ denied the Penalty Petition and the Termination Petition and ordered Employer to pay Claimant total disability benefits beginning on March 6, 1998.

However, Employer failed to follow the mandates of Section 406.1 of the Act by not issuing a notice of compensation payable or denial. The problems in this case as to the nature of the injury and whether Claimant’s claim is barred by the three-year statute of limitations stem from this failure. By failing to immediately issue a notice of compensation payable or denial, the exact nature of Claimant’s injury remained undefined.

However, the principle set forth in <em>Commercial Credit </em>is meant to be used by employers as a shield to prevent claimants from alleging other unrelated injuries at the 11th hour in workers’ compensation proceedings in an attempt to stop benefits for accepted work-related injuries from being terminated. That is not what happened here. In this case, Employer is attempting to use this principle as a sword to stop Claimant from receiving benefits for her left knee which is, of course, part of the left leg which Employer has acknowledged as being injured.

    <p id="b703-5" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[96,781,753,923]]]'>Because Employer paid Claimant’s medical expenses, the statute of limitations was tolled through March of 1998. Thus, Claimant timely raised the issues regarding her work-related injuries when she filed the Penalty Petition in June of 1998, as this was less than three years after the most recent payment of compensation benefits by Employer in the form of the payment of medical bills. Therefore, Employer’s statute of limitations argument must fail. Therefore, we conclude that the WCJ did not err by denying the Termination Petition and ordering Employer to pay Claimant total disability benefits beginning on March 6, 1998, which is the day that Claimant could no longer continue working due to her left knee injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Employer also argues that the WCJ issued conflicting findings when she accepted the testimony of Claimant as credible but also found the testimony of Helen Vesey more credible wherever Claimant’s testimony was inconsistent with Ms. Vesey’s testimony. We fail to see any inconsistency. Ms. Vesey maintained Claimant’s safety file and she testified about the information in that file. The fact that the WCJ accepted the testimony of the custodian of that file as more credible than Claimant to the extent there was any inconsistency is of no consequence and has no bearing on the main issue in this case.</p>
