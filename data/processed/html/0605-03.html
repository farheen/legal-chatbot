Following a penalty phase hearing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance, that the murder was committed during the course of a felony (kidnapping),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and two mitigating circumstances, that Appellant had no significant history of prior convictions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and that he acted under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After weighing the aggravating circumstance against the two mitigating circumstances, the jury concluded that the former outweighed the latter. Accordingly, the jury returned a verdict of death against Appellant.

Appellant lived approximately two blocks away from the Miller residence in West York, Pennsylvania. Brenda Miller further testified that on January 17, 1995, she spent the evening at home with her boyfriend, Manuel, and Erica Miller. When Brenda Miller went to bed at around 9:30 p.m., Erica Miller was on the ■ couch in the living room, where she usually slept. After Brenda and Manuel went to bed, but before they fell asleep, Brenda heard Erica ask someone something to the effect of whether they or someone else would still be up. Brenda Miller testified that she assumed that her daughter was talking with someone on the telephone, since no one else was in the house and she didn’t hear anyone respond to Erica’s question. When Brenda awoke the next morning, her daughter was nowhere to be found. However, there was no sign of a forced entry into the home, and Erica’s cigarettes, lighter, and personal effects had been left sitting in the living room.</p>

Tom March told the police that he and his girlfriend, Cheryl Smith, had just discovered a body buried on their farm property. Tom March and Cheryl Smith led police officers responding to the call to a partially dug-up shallow grave located next to a barn on their property. The police continued the excavation initiated by Tom March and Cheryl Smith, and fully uncovered Erica Miller’s body. The body was gagged and nude. On March 3, 1995, the police discovered a shotgun shell casing and two shotgun shell waddings at the gravesite.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> An autopsy conducted by forensic pathologist Dr. Sarah Funke revealed that Erica Miller had been shot at close range twice in the back of the head.</p>

Charlie Miller, Erica’s brother, testified that he spoke with Erica on the telephone a few days before Erica’s disappearance and in their conversation, Erica confided in him that Appellant offered her a job guarding a female victim/witness in a safe house. According to Charlie Miller, Erica told him that Appellant needed a woman to do the job because the victim/witness was a woman. Additionally, Charlie Miller testified that Erica told him that she was not supposed to say anything about the job because she was going to have to take a lie detector test. Erica explained to her brother that she only told him about the job because they were so close and she knew he wouldn’t tell anybody. Similarly, Sharon Buckingham, a friend of the Millers, testified that a few days before Erica disappeared, Erica told her that she was going to get a job with the government for $15 an hour, that it was a classified position, and that she was not supposed to talk about the job. Finally, Todd Schulz, an acquaintance of Erica Miller’s, testified that a few days before her disappearance, Erica told him that a friend offered her a job guarding a safe house for $15 an hour.</p>

At trial, Tom March testified that in January of 1995, Appellant asked March if he could borrow March’s shotgun to go squirrel hunting since March’s shotgun had a longer barrel than his shotgun, which was more effective for hunting squirrels. March agreed to lend his shotgun to Appellant, and Appellant promised to clean March’s shotgun before he returned it. According to March, he lent his shotgun to Appellant on January 16, 1995, the day before Erica Miller disappeared, and Appellant returned the shotgun to him, fully cleaned, on January 18, 1995, the day after Erica Miller disappeared.

Appellant explained that he wanted to bury the box because it would help decrease his insurance payments. Tom March agreed to allow Appellant to bury his box and conduct a “prisoner exchange” on his property, but demanded that he do <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>so at the end of the driveway by the barn, because he didn’t want those things going on near his home and children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Cheryl Smith subsequently testified that at approximately 7:45 a.m. on the day following Appellant’s request to bury the box and conduct the prisoner exchange on the March/Smith property, she saw Appellant’s car next to the barn when she walked her daughter to the bus stop. At that time, Cheryl Smith did not see Appellant, but later that day, Appellant came to her home and told her that he was done with his business at the barn and she could return to that area.</p>

After they wrapped the deer meat, Appellant showed March a patch of freshly disturbed soil near the barn and told March that he buried his box under that soil. According to March, Appellant visited him much more frequently after Appellant showed him where he buried his box. Additionally, Appellant repeatedly asked March if anyone had been around where the box was buried, and asked March if he was going to lay stones over the area where the box was buried.</p>

On the way there, Appellant told March that someone had called a tavern near a hunting cabin that March and Appellant shared, and asked if anyone saw Appellant with a missing 19 year-old girl at the tavern.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Tom March found it extremely odd that someone would make such a telephone call, and told Cheryl Smith about his conversation with Appellant that same night. Cheryl Smith testified that upon hearing about the conversation, she recalled seeing a poster in the grocery store about a missing 19 year-old girl from the West York area. March, and especially Smith, became suspicious of the box that Appellant buried on their property, Cheryl Smith demanded that they dig up the box to discover its true contents. After arguing with Smith, March agreed to dig up the box. On the evening of March 2, 1995, the two drove to the barn and began to dig in the spot where Appellant told March he buried his box. Tom March eventually uncovered what he thought was a wrapping around the box and directed Cheryl Smith to get his razor blade so he could cut through it. In the meantime, March continued digging, and uncovered what he immediately recognized to be a human arm. Shocked at their discovery, March and Smith jumped into their truck, sped down the drive to their home and called 911.</p>

The Commonwealth also presented evidence that Erica Miller was ultimately found a substantial distance from where she was last seen — her mother’s home. In addition, the place where Erica Miller was ultimately found — next to a barn on the March/Smith property — could certainly be reasonably considered a place of isolation. Finally, there was evidence that Erica was stripped of her clothes and gagged before she was murdered, which further indicates that she was confined against her will in a place of isolation. Thus, the Commonwealth presented circumstantial evidence tending to establish that Appellant lured Erica from her home based on a deception, took her a substantial distance to an isolated portion of the March/Smith property, gagged and stripped her, dug a grave for her, placed her or forced her into the grave, and killed her.

Appellant additionally claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor's description of the shotgun waddings found at the crime scene as blood soaked.
