In 1991 Mary filed a complaint seeking a divorce, and a trial was held in February 1992.

In June 1992 the court entered a judgment of divorce and distributed the marital property. Mary promptly filed a motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court denied the motion, but on appeal the Superior Court remanded the case for further findings. In July 1993, four months after the remand, the District Court ordered the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. After the parties complied, the District Court adopted verbatim David’s proposed findings and conclusions. On Mary’s second appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the District Court judgment and this appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b1005-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1005.9",1005,[996,291,759,1180]]]'>In 1979 David began earning credits with the Teamster’s Union pension fund and continued earning credits after the couple married. The pension plan permitted four benefit choices that included a single life annuity option and three different survivor options. At the trial both parties offered expert testimony on the values of the marital and non-marital portions of the pension. David’s expert testified that the total present value of the pension was $29,000 and that the value of the marital portion was $9,200. Mary’s expert testified that because she was substantially younger than David, the values of the survivor options would be greater than the single annuity option. He testified that depending on the option chosen, the present total value would range from $36,000 to $52,-000, with the corresponding values for the marital portions ranging from $13,000 to $19,000. In its findings as proposed by David, the court explicitly stated that it accepted the valuation of Mary’s expert and found the total present value to be $52,000 and the marital portion to be $13,000.</p>
    <p id="b1005-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1005.10",1005,[996,1503,760,1039]]]'>A court’s determination of what property is marital or nonmarital is reviewed for clear error and will not be disturbed if there is competent evidence in the record to support it. <em>Williams v.

Although there is competent evidence in this record to support a finding that the marital portion of the pension was $13,000, there is not competent evidence to support a finding both that the total present value was $52,000 and that the value of the marital portion was only $13,000. By finding that the total present value was $52,000, the court necessarily adopted the most valuable survivor option. The only evidence of the value of the marital portion of this option was offered by Mary’s expert, who valued the marital portion at $19,000. The court’s finding that the value of this marital portion was only $13,000 is inconsistent with its finding that the total value was $52,000 and is, therefore, clearly erroneous.</p>

He <a id="p948" href="#p948" data-label="948" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*948</a>later borrowed $2,800 against the plan. At the time of the trial the gross value of the plan was approximately $10,000. A few weeks before trial, David borrowed an additional $4,100 against the plan. The loan cheek, however, was inadvertently delivered to Mary and she was still in possession of the uncashed check at the time of the trial.</p>

Not only had David not yet received the proceeds from the second loan, those proceeds were actually in Mary’s possession. Although David testified that the purpose of the loans was for payment of marital expenses, there is no evidence that the proceeds were used for that purpose. The court’s finding is, therefore, clearly erroneous. The result of this erroneous finding is that the value of the $4,100 cheek is not properly accounted for in the divorce judgment. From the judgment it appears that David receives only the 401(k) plan which the court valued at $4,000.</p>

Moreover, the court’s adoption of David’s assessment of the property distribution as “a one-sided distribution of property in [Mary’s] favor” indicates that these findings were not the product of careful deliberation.
