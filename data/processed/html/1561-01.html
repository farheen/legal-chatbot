The differently dimensioned openings in the rows are disposed in staggered substantially non-overlapping relation to one another. The resultant trim strip has the rigidity required in dry-wall constructions. Applicant’s slot array is such that projections of the slots in both rows into a base line extending the length of the trim member occupy substantially all of said line and thus it permits the formation of an effectively continuous line of joint cement bond with the underlying panels of <a id="p1565" href="#p1565" data-label="1565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1565</a>the dry-wall construction. Appellant asserts that the trim member permits the establishment of a far better bond than was possible in the prior art, and further that he achieves these results without detracting from the strength or rigidity of the trim member necessary to a satisfactory dry-wall installation.

See <em>Eibel Process </em>v. <em>Minnesota &amp; Ontario Paper Co., </em><a href="/us/261/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="261 U.S. 45" data-case-ids="6137018" data-case-paths="/us/261/0045-01">261 U.

    <p id="b889-5" data-blocks='[["BL_889.5",889,[225,974,1330,904]]]'>These problems arise in so-called “dry-wall” constructions, which are used in building construction and which are built up from preformed panels of gypsum rock, or the like, having cardboard of similar sheets secured to the outer surfaces thereof. When such panels are secured to the framing structure of the wall and positioned to form a corner, the corner must be protected and the joint between the panels must be filled with a joint cement. In the dry-wall art, prior to applicant’s invention, such a finished structure was produced by first nailing an elongated metal trim strip of substantially L-shaped section to the meeting w'allboard panels, using nails normally spaced some eight inches apart. “Joint cement” or filler material was applied over the heads of the nails and formed to have its outer surface lie in a plane flush with the rounded corner bead of the trim strip. The joint cement was tapered or flattened from the bead to blend smoothly into the surface of the wallboard adjacent the edge of the trim strip. The joint cement normally employed in dry-wall constructions is a relatively low strength material which is primarily used -to conceal the corner strip and nail heads.</p>

Claim 11, supra, directed to the trim strip itself, calls for a trim member comprising a pair of straight “substantially planar trim sections” joined by an elongated bead; specifies that each of the trim sections have “at least two substantially parallel rows of elongated slots extending length-wise of said trim section”; further states that the slots are so arranged that “projections of said slots on each trim section, onto a base line, which extends the length of said trim member [occupy] substantially all of said base line without substantial overlapping”; and further states that the trim member has <a id="p1566" href="#p1566" data-label="1566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1566</a>“substantial rigidity * * * both longitudinally and transversely”. The claims dependent upon claim 11 bring out further dimensional relationships between applicant’s differently dimensioned slots (claim 12); the positional relationships of such differently dimensioned slots with respect to the bead (claim 13); the positional relationship of certain nail holes to the slots (claim 14) ; the relationship of the area of the slots to the area of the nail holes (claim 15); and the filler capacity and positioning of certain relatively narrower and wider slots, relative to one another (claim 19).</p>

For example, claim 1 calls for at least two substantially parallel rows of openings, with certain openings of “lesser open area” overlying a cavity defined adjacent the junction of the wallboard panels; and with larger area openings “in the form of elongated slots” overlying the wallboard itself, rather than said cavity. Similiar limitations are found in the other combination claims: thus, claim 2 recites that both rows have elongated slots with the slots overlying the wallboard members “being narrower” than the slots overlying the wallboard cavity. Claim 3 calls for “at least two substantially parallel rows of differently dimensioned elongated slots” and recites the positioning of these “differently dimensioned elongated” slots relative to one another and to various portions of the over-all wallboard assembly. Even more specific recitations of the structure may be found in certain of the dependent claims: thus, claim 6 relates the length of the elongated slots to the width of the trim section; claim 7 relates the width of the elongated slots to the width of the trim section; claim 8 relates both the lengths and widths of the various slots to the width of the trim section; claim 9 recites the provision of an auxiliary row of bonding holes located between the rows of slots and the corner bead, and the positioning of said auxiliary holes relative to the elongated slots; and claim 10 defines the width and length dimensions of the slots in one row in relation to the length and width dimensions of the slots in a different row.</p>

He further asserts that what he has done represents an unobvious departure from the teachings of the references. The structural differences between the trim member claimed by appellant and the trim members of the prior art and the many attendant practical advantages <a id="p1567" href="#p1567" data-label="1567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1567</a>have been established in the record by affidavits of persons shilled in the art of dry-wall construction, and appellant urges these as evidence of the unobviousness of the present invention.</p>

Instead, as above pointed out, the claims are carefully drawn to define not “holes” but elongated slots <em>having particular sizes and relationships with each other. </em>These sizes and relationships are closely related to the over-all requirements of a trim strip suitable for dry-wall construction and were developed as the means by which to solve a persistent problem in this art.</p>

Clark does not even mention cracking or fracture problems of dry-wall assemblies, since Clark is concerned with a “wet-wall” structure which does not have the problem due to the greater structural strength of plaster (R. 31). Clark shows a corner bead construction intended for installation in a wet wall, and used as a skeleton or shaping device adapted to receive plaster.

After slits are formed, the metal is stretched laterally thereby to deform and off-set the narrow intervening strips so as to cause these strips to upstand from the original metal plane and produce a third dimension in the structure. This third dimension is clearly evident in each of the Clark patents, i.e., see the several cross-sections at R. 87, and see also Figure 2 at R. 91. Such a three-dimensional device clearly differs from the “planar trim sections” specified in each of the claims on appeal. Moreover, the existence of this three-dimensional configuration makes the Clark structures totally useless for dry-wall constructions since (a) Clark’s trim strip would be far too flimsy to provide proper structural support for the relatively weak joint cement; since (b) so much joint cement would be required to cover and conceal the three-dimensional trim as to render the installation uneconomical (joint cement being very much more expensive than plaster) ; since (c) the joint cement, even if applied to such a three-dimensional corner structure, would have to be feathered out far beyond the trim strip to merge <a id="p1569" href="#p1569" data-label="1569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1569</a>the cement smoothly into the adjacent wall-board; and since (d) so much joint cement would have to be provided as to result in severe cracking of the joint cement.</blockquote>

And it did so without weakening the rigidity of the construction. Other advantages to which the evidence of record refers are the attendant decrease in the time required for strip installation; ease in cutting of the strips to length; easier application of the joint cement; and better retention of the joint cement.</p>

Even though affiant employed hundreds of thousands of feet of corner bead and casing employing round holes in 1954, 1955 and 1956, it was not obvious to him that it would be advantageous to use slotted holes instead. In affiant’s opinion, it would not be obvious to replace the round holes of the McChesney structure with the elongated holes of the Schepis [Clark] structure since the McChesney structure was intended for use in dry-wall construction and the Schepis [Clark] structure and similar expanded metal lath structures which have been known since 1934 were only intended for use in wet-wall construction.</blockquote>
