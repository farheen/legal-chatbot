Basile filed a lawsuit against Block, alleging that, among other things, Block breached its fiduciary duty in connection with its “Rapid Refund™” program. The Rapid Refund program allowed individuals to receive their income tax refund within days after electronically filing their income tax return by receiving a short-term loan from Mellon Bank. Basile alleged that Block thus deceived customers because the customers did not know they were receiving a short-term loan from Mellon Bank and the fees imposed by Block were actually extremely high interest rates on the short-term loan. Basile specifically alleged that she believed she received an expedited refund because she electronically filed the return and was not aware it was actually a short-term loan.</p>

First, as stated previously, Block did indeed file a cross-appeal in the Appellees’ 1998 appeal from the summary judgment in its favor. In addition, as the prevailing party, Block was not required to file a protective appeal for every interlocutory adverse order entered prior to summary judgment in order to protect against the possibility that the Superior Court might reverse the summary judgment entered in its favor. Therefore, Block did not waive its challenge to class certification.

I do not mean to invoke language that is not presently in our rule. Rather, my intent is to point out that our present rule is ambiguous, as noted by the federal advisoiy committee and various commentators upon their review of the similar language previously used in Federal Rule 23. <em>See, e.g., </em>6A Fed. Proc., L.Ed. § 12:293 (2008). Indeed, well prior to the amendment to the federal rule, the United States Supreme Court and many other federal courts were reading former Rule 23's "decision on the merits” language as referring to final judgment. <em>See, e.g., Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em><a href="/us/437/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="437 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6181618" data-case-paths="/us/437/0478-01">437 U.S. 478</a>, 480 n. 6, <a href="/us/437/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="437 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6181618" data-case-paths="/us/437/0478-01">98 S.Ct. 2451</a>, 2453 n. 6, <a href="/us/437/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="437 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6181618" data-case-paths="/us/437/0478-01">57 L.Ed.2d 364</a> (1978). I find such an interpretation to be reasonable and consistent with the purposes of the rules and the appropriate administration of class action proceedings.</p>

The change also removes any inference from this language that class treatment not denominated as conditional must necessarily be considered permanent. I believe we would also be well advised to consider a similar change to our rules.</p>

Appellees also argue the common pleas court lacked authority to decertify tire class, since the Superior Court had ruled that the confidential relationship issue could be considered on a class-wide basis. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees at 18-19 n. 11. I differ with Appellees' premise, however, since the relevant Superior Court decision was explicitly a narrow one tied to the summary judgment inquiiy. <em>See Basile v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., <a href="/a2d/777/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="777 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="11077738" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0095-01">777 </a></em><a href="/a2d/777/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="777 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="11077738" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0095-01">A.2d 95</a>, 107-08 (Pa.Super.2001). Thus, and because the appropriateness of class treatment may depend on developing circumstances, I do not regará the Superior Court's decision as foreclosing further inquiry into the propriety of the certification.</p>

Although I agree with the Majority that protective cross-appeals are not required, I write separately to second Justice Saylor’s inclinations to deem protective cross-appeals impermissible. Concurring Op. at 424-25 (Saylor, J.). However, unlike Justice Saylor, I believe the Court should make that determination in this case. Given that the Superior Court premised its holding on H &amp; R Block’s alleged failure to file a protective cross-appeal, the issue of protective cross-appeals is squarely before us, allowing us to consider the validity, as well as necessity, of such appeals for the bench and bar according to our rules of appellate procedure.</p>

Additionally, the prohibition of protective cross-appeals eliminates the question of whether a non-aggrieved party filing a protective cross-appeal must raise every potential appeal-able issue for fear of waiver. I note, in closing, that to the extent permissive cross-appeals would deluge our courts, requiring every potential issue to be raised by a non-aggrieved party in a protective cross-appeal, on pain of waiver, would turn such deluge into a full-fledged tsunami.</p>
