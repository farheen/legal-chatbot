As noted previously herein, in other school districts, when employees have taken leave similar to Claimants’ for service with a union, only the standard school salary and not the salary for union service has been reported to and credited by PSERS for retirement purposes. The parties in this matter stipulated that prior to the 2000-01 school year, the School District reported salaries for Claimants to PSERS in line with the salaries Claimants would have earned for their regular school positions had they not taken a leave for service with their respective unions. Thereafter, the School District reported the salaries Claimants earned while working or serving full time with the unions which exceeded Claimants’ standard school salaries.

Claimants contend that there are four elements that must be satisfied in order to obtain retirement credit while engaged in service to a union: (1) application to the local school board for a leave of absence; (2) approval of the application; (3) payment by the local school board of the salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits to the employee during the entire period of the leave of absence; and (4) reimbursement by the union to the school board for such salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits paid to the employee during the entire period of the leave of absence. Claimants argue that the Board erroneously imports a fifth element by focusing on the words “as if’. Claimants contend that the Board erroneously adopted the position that an employee on an approved leave of absence with a <a id="p668" href="#p668" data-label="668" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*668</a>union may only receive retirement credit up to the salary of the position from which he or she is on leave. Claimants argue that the Board’s interpretation effectively freezes the member’s salary to that which he or she received immediately prior to the leave, and further removes the discretion of local school districts to adjust salaries and benefits commensurate with levels of responsibility during the periods of such leave.</p>
    <p id="b716-4" data-blocks='[["BL_716.5",716,[185,827,756,758]]]'>Claimants contend that the words “as if’ may equally refer to employees being paid in “the same manner” that they were paid prior to the approved leave but not necessarily in the same amount. Claimants argue that Section 8102 does not limit the retirement credit a member may receive to no more than the salary of the position from which the employee is on leave. Thus, Claimants contend that the General Assembly chose not to interfere with the local school boards’ discretion to set salaries for its employees, including those on approved leaves of absences to render service to a union.</p>

First, with respect to Claimants’ contention that at no point in 1992 or 1994 or at any other time did the General Assembly expressly limit the salary to be paid to union officials on leaves of absence under Section 8102, we point out that the General Assembly also did not expressly provide that the salary creditable for retirement purposes is that which the unions actually pay a member of PSERS on approved leave rather than the standard school salary. In addition, by amending the Retirement Code to include leave for service with a collective bargaining organization, the General Assembly did not explicitly remove a school district’s discretion to set salaries or direct that the salaries be frozen at any particular level. The plain language of the definition of “Leave for service with a collective bargaining organization” simply does not support such assertions.</p>

We recognize that the General Assembly amended the Retirement Code in response to the Attorney General’s Official Opinion that school employees on leave for service with a collective bar-gaining organization were not entitled to retirement credit. The parties in the matter do not dispute that the purpose of the 1992 and 1994 amendments to the Retirement Code was to permit members who are on approved leaves of absences to serve with a collective bargaining organization to receive retirement credit. However, the present provisions of the Retirement Code do not reflect an intent by the General Assembly to permit a member’s benefits to be enhanced because the salary the union pays for his or her service is greater than the standard school salary to which that member would be entitled if he remained employed by a school district. There is no indication that the intent of the General Assembly was to permit such members to receive an enhanced benefit because of their choice to serve with a collective bargaining organization rather than continue employment with a school district. To the contrary, the clear intent was to ensure that members serving with a union did not lose any benefits to which they would otherwise continue to be entitled to if they had remained in the employ of a school district.</p>

Therefore, the enhanced compensation received by Claimants should not be included in their final average salaries. As stated by our Supreme Court, “[t]he restrictive definitions of compensation under the Retirement Code ... reflect the Legislature’s intention to preserve the actuarial integrity of the retirement fund by ‘excluding from the computation of employes’ final average salary all payments which may artificially inflate compensation for the purpose of enhancing retirement benefits.’ ” <em>Christiana, </em>543 Pa. at 141, 669 A.2d at 944 (quoting <em>Laurito, </em>606 A.2d at 611).</p>
    <p id="b719-4" data-blocks='[["BL_719.4",719,[163,1022,754,806]]]'>Moreover, the fact that the Retirement Code does not define “standard salary schedule” or “enhanced compensation” is of no moment. The Retirement Code clearly defines the terms “compensation”, “school employee”, “final average salary” and “Leave for service with collective bargaining organization.” In reading the foregoing definitions in tandem, it is clear that the Board did not err in denying Claimants’ request to have the full compensation they received during their leaves for service with a union, which exceeded the standard school salary schedule, to be included as compensation for retirement purposes.</p>

Pursuant to that test, a claimant may rebut a prima facie severance payment by showing that the payment is in accord with the scheduled customary salary scale within the school district for personnel with the same education and experience qualifications. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, the record shows that the enhanced salaries paid to Claimants by the unions was over and above the standard or customary salary scale with the School District for personnel with the same education and experience qualifications.</p>
