On appeal Caulk contends that 1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the State violated the Interstate Compact on Detainers, 2) he was denied his constitutionally protected right to a speedy trial, 3) the trial court erroneously failed to impose the sanction of dismissal of the indictment for claimed discovery violations by the State, 4) certain evidence was erroneously admitted at trial, and 5) the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict of the jury.

Mrs. Nikki Cleveland had been murdered on July 13, 1981. She was a part-time real estate agent. Prior to July 13, 1981 she had listed for sale a secluded camp in North Yarmouth off Sligo Road. Mrs. Cleveland advertised the listed property in several local papers, giving her name and home and office telephone numbers. During the Fourth of July weekend in 1981 Mrs. Cleveland’s husband received a call at their home about the property from a person identifying himself as “a writer ... just passing through town,” and who refused to give his name. On the morning of July 12 while Mrs. Cleveland was out, Mr. Cleveland received a call from a male who stated he had called the previous week about the property and asking for Mrs. Cleveland. Again he refused to give his name. Also on that morning, an unidentified man called Mrs. Cleveland’s office about the listed property. Several hours later Mrs. Cleveland was at home when she received a telephone call and made an appointment to show the property at 1:30 on Monday the 13th. According to the telephone company records, toll calls were made on the morning of July 12 to Mrs. Cleveland’s residence and to her office from the East Boothbay residence of Caulk, where he lived alone.</p>

Approximately one hour later, at 1:30 p.m., she again heard the dogs barking and, though still on the telephone, walked over to the window of her kitchen to see a woman in a blue rain slicker, later identified as Mrs. Cleveland, walking down the dirt road toward the camp. Hoyt then went outside to request identification from the woman, but decided not to follow her down to the listed property because the road was too muddy. She was startled that the woman had chosen to walk down the road because, atypically, the gate was already open and she saw a gray car parked by the gate. Mrs. Cleveland was wearing a blue rain slicker on that day and <a id="p1368" href="#p1368" data-label="1368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1368</a>driving a gray Peugeot station wagon that was found parked by the gate of the driveway to the Sligo Road property.</p>

Instead of seeing a woman in a blue rain slicker walking up the road, Hoyt was surprised to see a blue-green car being driven quickly up the road. She ran outside, yelling for the driver to stop. He did not. The sole occupant seen by her in the car was a male driver, who turned toward her, waved and smiled.</p>

Hoyt could not, however, positively identify Caulk from a photo array. In 1981 Caulk was living in Boothbay Harbor under the name of William John Meskis. He worked at a boatyard in East Boothbay Harbor from May of 1981 to June 1982. He drove a blue-green Ford Maverick. He was then 34 and had a mustache and did not wear glasses. On Monday, the day of the murder, he left work at 11:30 a.m. and did not return to work until Thursday, the 16th. He offered no explanation to his employer for his absence.</p>

The spent bullet and other bullet fragments recovered from the body were identified as being fired from a revolver stolen by Caulk while in California prior to 1981. On August 8, 1986, an indictment was returned against Caulk charging him with “intentionally and knowingly causing the death of Nikki Cleveland” on or about July 13, 1981.

Caulk was then incarcerated in a New Hampshire prison. On August 26,1986, pursuant to the Compact, the State lodged a detainer against Caulk and requested that New Hampshire determine whether Caulk wished to waive extradition. On August 28 Caulk was notified of the murder indictment against him and was informed of his right to a speedy trial under the Compact. On that same date, New Hampshire informed Maine that Caulk chose not to waive extradition and made no formal speedy trial request. Maine then initiated temporary custody proceedings under Article IV to force Caulk’s appearance in Maine. On December 9, 1986, Caulk filed a writ of habeas corpus contesting his return to Maine. Pri- or to a hearing on that writ, Caulk, on January 12, 1987, made a written request for disposition of the Maine indictment and was transported to Maine on January 13, 1987. On January 14, 1987 Caulk was arraigned in the Superior Court, York County, and pleaded not guilty. The trial on the charge against Caulk commenced on June 29, 1987, well within the 180-day period required by Article III.

Here, the State argues that Detective Por-ras’s opinion was based on other admissions by Caulk and his investigation, not simply on “a belief’ that Caulk’s statement to him was false. The admissions of Caulk that might have supported Porras’s testimony were not in evidence, nor was Por-ras’s “investigation” of Caulk in this matter. <em>See </em>M.R.Evid. 602 (witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence introduced sufficient to support finding he has personal knowledge of matter). Moreover, the opinion was an invasion of the jury’s province to determine Caulk’s credibility on the evidence admitted during the course of the trial and its observations of him and cannot be said to have been “helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination” of the factual issue of the credibility of Caulk.</p>

We will disturb a conviction “only if no trier of fact rationally could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>State v.

He contends only that there was not sufficient evidence to convict him of the crime. The primary issue in this case was the identity of the murderer. The record discloses that the jury heard the following evidence: one of two telephone calls from an unidentified caller on July 12, 1981 to Mrs. Cleveland’s home and the call to her real estate agency office on that date inquiring about the listed property were traced to Caulk’s home, where he lived alone; without explanation Caulk left work before noon on Monday, July 13th and did not return until Thursday, July 16; Mrs. Hoyt identified the car that drove across her property on the 13th as being a “blue-green car”; Caulk owned a “blue-green car” on that date; Mrs. Hoyt also gave a generally accurate description of Caulk to the police following the murder; the State’s ballistics experts were “100 percent” certain that the bullet recovered from Mrs. Cleveland’s body and a bullet known to have been fired from the revolver that Caulk admitted he had stolen in 1980 and used in criminal activity had both been fired from the same gun. Based on this evidence a jury rationally could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Caulk had committed the crime with which he was charged.</p>
