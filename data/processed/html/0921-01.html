    <p id="b372-9" data-blocks='[["BL_372.9",372,[278,745,1335,1388]]]'>In its notice of opposition, appellee alleged that it was the owner of the trade-mark “ The American Girl ”; that it and its predecessor had continuously used its trade-mark on ladies’ and misses’ shoes since long prior to the year 1900; that on August 21,1906, a certificate of registration was issued to it — No. 56100; that opposer’s trademark has become associated in the public mind with opposer and its goods; that one of its predecessors, from which opposer derives title, entered into a contract with applicant, a part of which reads: “(1) The party of the first part hereby recognizes as valid and binding as between the parties hereto, their successors and assigns, and all persons claiming by, through or under them, the construction of the decree dated November 15, 1909, which permits the party of the second part, Hamilton, Brown Shoe Company, its successors and assigns, to use the name ‘American Lady,’ as applied to its shoes for women, provided that the said name ‘American Lady ’ is accompanied on its shoes themselves, with the name ‘ Hamilton, Brown Shoe Company,’ and the word ‘Makers ’; and the party of the first part agrees for itself, its successors and assigns, that it will not use, or authorize anyone other than the party of the second part to use the name ‘American Lady ’ as applied to shoes ”; that the marks “American Lady ” and “ The American Girl ” were confusingly similar, and that the registration of applicant’s alleged trade-mark would “create confusion to the damage of the opposer and will create confusion among the public as to the source or origin of goods bearing either of said marks, unless the applicant confines its use to that prescribed in the referred to contract, or, in other words, unless the applicant company clearly indicates with the words ‘American Lady ’ that the products bearing such mark are made by Hamilton, Brown Shoe Company.”</p>

It was alleged in the motion, among other things, that under the contract set out in the notice of opposition appellee was estopped from opposing the registration by appellant of its alleged trademark ; that it did not appear from the notice of opposition that op-poser would be damaged by the registration of applicant’s trademark; and that, by virtue of the contract referred to in the notice of <a id="p923" href="#p923" data-label="923" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*923</a>opposition, the registration of the mark “American Lady” would not interfere with the rights of the opposer.</p>

S. 251</a>, the Supreme Court held that the involved trade-marks, applied as they were to shoes, were confusingly and deceptively similar; and that, as opposer was the owner of the trade-mark “ The American Girl,” applicant had no right to use the words “American Lady” as a trade-mark on its products. The commissioner further pointed out in his decision that the involved contract granted to applicant the right to the use of the words “American Lady” as a trade-mark for shoes for women, provided those words were “ accompanied on the shoes themselves with the name ‘ Hamilton, Brown Shoe Company ’ and the word ‘ Makers,’ ” so that the public might not be confused as to the origin of the shoes of the respective parties.</p>

Obviously, if appellant has no right to the use of the words “American Lady ” as a trade-mark, unless accompanied by unregisterable language, it is not entitled to registration. Furthermore, the goods ■of the parties possess the same descriptive properties, and, as the mark “ American Lady ” is confusingly and deceptively similar to appellee’s mark — “ The American Girl ” — appellant is not entitled to have the words “ American Lady ” registered as its trade-mark.</p>
