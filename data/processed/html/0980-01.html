The trial court ruled that evidence could be admitted relating to the original drug transaction giving rise to the debt and to the demands for payment, but that no evidence could be presented that Bullock led a drug distribution organization or about the general rules of that organization, nor that Johnson was Bullock’s lieutenant and enforcer.</p>

In November of 1987, in a drug establishment called “Penny’s,” as Bullock stood by, Johnson handed “ten-packs” of heroin to Smith and the witness, Lenora Cole, to sell on the streets. Thereafter,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Smith sold heroin from a “ten-pack” to an acquaintance, Donald Fields, at the same time indicating to Fields a fear of Bullock — who was standing nearby during the transaction — and a desire to leave the drug-selling area without completing the sale of all of his drugs.</p>

Bullock made increasingly hostile demands of Fields to relay his request for money to Smith until, on January 15, 1988, the day before the killing, Bullock told Fields that he was “tired of talking,” that he wanted his money from Smith, and that Fields must transmit his demands to Smith. As Fields put it, Bullock’s demands “went from I want to see him to tell him I don’t have any rap for him, I want my money.”</p>
    <p id="b1048-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1048.11",1048,[1027,541,749,743]]]'>On January 16, 1988, the day of the murder, Fields told Smith about Bullock’s demands. About an hour later Bullock arrived at 11th and 0 Streets where Smith was stationed. Bullock was with Cole, from whom he was also seeking money owed him from the sale of drugs. On the way to 11th and 0, Bullock had asked Cole whether she had seen Smith, but she had lied and answered no. Just at that moment she saw Smith as she and Bullock neared the intersection, and they headed straight for him. As they approached Smith, Bullock ordered Cole to go around the block, find Johnson, and tell him to bring Bullock “his stuff.” Cole left to do so.</p>
    <p id="b1048-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1048.12",1048,[1024,1313,749,610]]]'>Zanton Brown testified that just before the murder, Bullock had threatened her (Brown) while he had his hand on a pistol in his belt. He told her to move on or else he would “kill [her] ass, too.” Frightened, Brown hastened away from the area. Linda Young stated that she heard Bullock threaten both Brown and Smith, demanding his money from Smith. According to Young, Bullock said to Smith: “He [presumably Fields] told me you was going to string me out. He said that but the time for talk is over now, man.”</p>

Meanwhile, Brenda Coates <a id="p983" href="#p983" data-label="983" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*983</a>approached Smith and Bullock intending to buy drugs from Smith, and heard Bullock demanding from Smith his “damn money” because Smith had “told [Bullock] the previous week that he would pay him and he ha[d]n’t paid him....” Bullock yelled at her to leave him and Smith alone, and Coates went across the street to stand in front of the liquor store. Coates, Young, Brown, Cole, and Fields all testified that they could hear Bullock yelling at Smith.</p>
    <p id="b1049-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1049.4",1049,[210,764,750,741]]]'>Coates testified that when she was over near Bullock, she had seen Johnson at the corner of 11th and 0 standing near the wall of a television shop. Fields, in an alley off 11th Street, stated that he also saw Johnson standing nearby during the altercation between Bullock and Smith. Fields testified that after Bullock threatened Smith, he saw Smith turn and begin to walk away from Bullock. As Smith turned, Johnson, the gunman, told Bullock to “step back.” Fields saw Bullock step back and raise his arm above his head. Johnson pulled a gun “from his coat” and fired at Smith, who flinched, turned back toward Bullock, and fell on the ground.</p>

      <blockquote id="b1050-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1050.9",1050,[1075,1750,685,449]]]'>You [the government] have to be able to show, for purposes of the motivation for this offense, that there was not just a street sale to Mr. Smith and he didn’t pay, but, rather, that there was an agreement as to how Mr. Smith was going to dispose of these drugs and then make the payment, but that doesn't mean that this whole organization comes in, because it is the fact of this sophisticated drug organization that would irreparably and unduly prejudice the jury against the two Defendants in this case.</blockquote>
      <p id="b1050-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1050.10",1050,[1043,2209,715,418]]]'>The court also mentioned several specific types of evidence that could come in under this category, including all evidence of: the November or December distribution to Cole, Fields, or Smith; the rules pertaining to the prospective sale of the drugs; and whether or not Smith left “his block” or sold "as many packets as he was supposed to under the rules, that is, he was supposed to sell ten packets, because that’s part of the drug sale and that’s part of the dispute over the drug sale.”</p>

In addition to an implied general objection to the <em>in limine </em>ruling, both appellants expressly objected at a number of points in the trial to the scope of the material allowed into evidence as Category C material. We assume, without deciding, the correctness of the exclusion of the category A and B material.</p>

We do not agree with appellant Johnson that the trial court "expressly prohibited” or failed to authorize the government to present any evidence of Johnson’s involvement in the drug operation. The trial court’s decision to admit other crimes evidence falling within the narrowly circumscribed Category C confines did not limit the drug evidence to that implicating only Bullock; rather, it only purported to limit the evidence to that pertaining to the November drug distribution to Smith and efforts <em>by both appellants </em>to recover their money for it, since all such evidence would prove both appellants’ motives to commit murder in January.</p>

The difficult discretionary task faced by the trial court was to admit sufficient evidence so that the jury could fairly understand the background and motivation of the crime itself without unduly prejudicing the appellants through the introduction of unnecessary details. That the trial court was aware of this responsibility is clear: “I’ll have to be particularly careful about what comes in and so will counsel, and I’ll hear objections when they’re pertinent." In a sense, what is at stake is presenting to the jury an adequate, but not prejudicially excessive, "explanation of the surrounding circumstances of the crime,” which the standard criminal instructions have recognized as a <em>Drew </em>exception. Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia No. 2.49(g) (3d ed. 1978). Our case law is unclear with respect to the circumstances under which such evidence may be admissible under <em>Drew. </em>As we recently pointed out, such evidence may come in without any limiting instruction only where it has a "close temporal relationship" with the crime itself. <em>Parker v.
