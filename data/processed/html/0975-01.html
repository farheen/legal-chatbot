    <p id="b1007-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.9",1007,[176,1221,752,791]]]'>This opinion addresses a motion to enjoin a vote of the stockholders of Toys “R” Us, Inc. (the “Company”) tomorrow to consider approving a merger with an acquisition vehicle formed by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (“the KKR Group”). If the merger is approved, the Toys “R” Us stockholders will receive $26.75 per share for their shares. The proposed merger resulted from a lengthy, publicly-announced search for strategic alternatives that began in January 2004, when the Company’s shares were trading for only $12.00 per share. The $26.75 per share merger consideration constitutes a 123% premium over that price.</p>
    <p id="b1007-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.10",1007,[174,2033,751,439]]]'>During the strategic process, the Toys “R” Us board of directors, nine of whose ten members are independent, had frequent meetings to explore the Company’s strategic options. The board, with the support of its one inside member, the company’s CEO, reviewed those options with an open mind, and with the advice of expert advisors.</p>
    <p id="b1007-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.11",1007,[173,2497,753,191]],["BL_1007.12",1007,[980,280,751,141]]]'>Eventually, the board settled on the sale of the Company’s most valuable asset, its toy retailing business, and the retention of the Company’s baby products retailing business, as its preferred option. It did so after considering a wide array of options, including a sale of the whole Company.</p>
    <p id="b1007-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.13",1007,[977,444,754,841]]]'>The Company sought bids from a large number of the most logical buyers for the toy business, and it eventually elicited attractive expressions of interest from four competing bidders who emerged from the market canvass. When due diligence was completed, the board put the bidders through two rounds of supposedly “final bids” for the toys business. In the midst of this process, one of the bidders expressed a serious interest in buying the whole company for a price of $23.25 per share, and then $24.00. The board decided to stick by its original option until that bidder made an offer to pay $25.25 per share and signaled it might bid even a dollar more.</p>
    <p id="b1007-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.14",1007,[972,1318,760,1054]]]'>When that happened, the board was presented with a bid that was attractive compared with its chosen strategy in light of the valuation evidence that its financial advisors had presented, and in light of the failure of any strategic or financial buyer to make any serious expression of interest in buying the whole Company — even a non-binding one conditioned on full due diligence or a friendly merger — despite the board’s openly expressed examination of its strategic alternatives. Recognizing that the attractive bids it had received for the toys business could be lost if it extended the process much longer, the “Executive Committee” of the board, acting in conformity with direction given to it by the whole board, approved the solicitation of bids for the entire Company from the final bidders for the toys business, after a short period of due diligence.</p>
    <p id="b1007-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.15",1007,[972,2397,753,292]],["BL_1008.1",1008,[176,288,752,442]]]'>When those whole Company bids came in, the winning bid of $26.75 per share from the KKR Group topped the next most favorable bid by $1.50 per share. The bidder that offered $25.25 per share did not increase its bid. After a thorough <a id="p980" href="#p980" data-label="980" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*980</a>examination of its alternatives and a final reexamination of the value of the Company, the board decided that the best way to maximize stockholder value was to accept the $26.75 bid. That was a reasonable decision given the wealth, of evidence that the board possessed regarding the Company’s value and the improbability of another bidder emerging.</p>
    <p id="b1008-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.5",1008,[172,754,754,740]]]'>In its proposed merger agreement containing the $26.75 offer, the KKR Group asked for a termination fee of 4% of the implied equity value of the transaction to be paid if the Company terminated to accept another deal, as opposed to the 3% offered by the company in its proposed draft. • Knowing that the only-other bid for the company was $1.50 per share or $350 million less, the Company’s negotiators nonetheless bargained the termination fee down to 3.75% the next day, and bargained down the amount of expenses the KKR Group sought in the event of a naked no vote.</p>
    <p id="b1008-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.6",1008,[172,1526,755,749]]]'>In their motion, the plaintiffs fault the Toys “R” Us board, arguing that it failed to fulfill its duty to act reasonably in pursuit of the highest attainable value for the Company’s stockholders. They complain that the board’s decision to conduct a brief auction for the full Company from the final bidders for the toys business was unreasonable, and that the board should have taken the time to conduct a new, full-blown search for buyers. Relatedly, they complain that the board unreasonably locked up the $26.75 bid by agreeing to draconian deal termination measures that preclude any topping bid.</p>
    <p id="b1008-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.7",1008,[173,2299,750,190]],["BL_1008.8",1008,[975,287,750,738]]]'>In this opinion, I reject those arguments. A hard look at the board’s decisions reveals that it made reasonable choices in confronting the real world circumstances it faced. That the board was supple in reacting to new circumstances and adroit in responding to a new development that promised, in its view, greater value to the stockholders is not evidence of infidelity or imprudence; it is consistent with the sort of difficult business decisions that corporate fiduciaries are required to make all the time. Having taken so much time to educate itself and having signaled publicly at the outset an openness to strategic alternatives, the Toys “R” Us board was well-positioned to make a reasoned decision to accept the $26.75 per share offer.</p>
    <p id="b1008-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.9",1008,[973,1056,752,851]]]'>Likewise, the choice of the board’s negotiators not to press too strongly for a reduction of the KKR Group’s desired 4% termination fee all the way to 3% was reasonable, given that the KKR Group had topped the next best bid by such a big margin. To refuse to risk a reduction in the top bid, when the next best alternative was so much lower, can hardly be said to be unreasonable, especially when the board’s negotiators did negotiate to reduce the termination fee from 4% to 3.75%. Furthermore, the size of the termination fee and the presence of matching rights in the merger agreement do not act as a serious barrier to any bidder willing to pay materially more than $26.75 per share.</p>
    <p id="b1008-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.10",1008,[973,1930,749,142]]]'>For these and other'reasons that I discuss below, the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.</p>

Given that the plaintiffs’ central claims were based on <em>Revlon, </em>rather than on any failures in disclosure, their explanation that the proxy statement for the merger vote was not final until May rings hollow.</p>
    <p id="b1009-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1009.7",1009,[180,949,750,946]]]'>The plaintiffs have not, as is sometimes the case in suits like this, offered a competing bid for the company that has been forestalled by a recalcitrant board of directors. Rather, they say they are simply shareholders, supposedly intent upon receiving top-dollar value for their shares. I say “supposedly” because despite their stated belief in the inadequacy of the merger consideration at issue — $26.75 per share — the plaintiffs both sold substantial blocks of their Toys “R” Us shares in the market after the merger announcement, for prices below the per share price offered in the proposed merger. The Iron Workers sold 5,210 shares, or 39% of their holdings at an average price of $25.80; Jolly Roger sold 103,800 shares, or 22% of its holdings at an average price of $26.01.</p>

      <em>Global Toys </em>— This division operates the Company’s famous toy stores both domestically and internationally, with the exception of Japan. By far the largest of the divisions, Global Toys accounted for more than $9 billion of the Company’s $11 billion in total annual sales, and operates the bulk of the Company’s stores. Entering 2004, the problem for Global Toys, particularly in the U.S. market, was its declining profitability, in the face of intense price competition from Wal-Mart, Target and other more diversified “big box” retailers.</blockquote>

Babies “R” Us operates over 200 specialty retail stores that sell a full range of products for expectant mothers and babies. The division has experienced impressive growth in recent years and has higher profit margins than Global Toys. By one measure, Babies “R” Us contributed approximately half of the Company’s operating earnings in 2004.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1009-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1009.13",1009,[1016,1436,715,396]]]'>
      <em>Toys Japan </em>— This division operates a chain of toy stores in Japan under the Toys “R” Us brand name. The Company only owns 48% of this chain. The parties in this case generally agree that Toys Japan comprises only around $1.00 per share of the Company’s overall value.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1009-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1009.14",1009,[976,1883,754,510]]]'>The operating relationship among the divisions is important to understand. As might be expected, the Company had tried to capitalize on economies of scale by using common distribution networks, information systems, and other back-bone services to operate the three divisions. Therefore, although the Company reported the divisions’ results separately, they did not in fact function with operational autonomy.</p>
    <p id="b1010-3" data-blocks='[["BL_1010.4",1010,[182,287,755,1005]]]'>
      <a id="p982" href="#p982" data-label="982" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*982</a>One critical implication of that reality for present purposes is its effect on the value of Babies “R” Us. The Company’s public filings likely understate the extent to which Babies “R” Us has been subsidized by Global Toys. That subsidy consists of overhead that Babies “R” Us uses but that is actually charged to the Global Toys division, a practice that results in an inflation of the Babies “R” Us division’s profits to the corresponding detriment of the profits of Global Toys. In this same vein, it is notable that in 2004 Babies “R” Us contributed only $245 million to the Company’s total of $787 million in EBIT-DA. For these reasons, the Company’s management and board do not consider Babies “R” Us to be equally as valuable, either in terms of assets, revenues, or profits, as Global Toys.</p>
    <p id="b1010-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1010.5",1010,[180,1315,755,753]]]'>Another important implication of the operational entanglement of the various divisions is its effect on the practicability of selling them as separate units. Babies “R” Us was not positioned to operate independently immediately upon a sale. Any buyer would be dependent for some substantial period on transitional services to be provided by the Company. And, of course, once Babies “R” Us acquired the functional capacity to conduct all of its required operations autonomously, its ongoing costs of operation would increase materially, perhaps by more than $100 million annually.</p>

The board retained an investment banking team from the retail group of Credit Suisse First Boston (“First Boston”) to help it develop and evaluate its options. In connection with that review, the board focused on an important part of the value of the Global Toys division — its real estate. Although the operations of Global Toys were suffering, that division owned many of the properties on which its stores operated. Those properties were very valuable in a hot real estate market, a fact which presented the Company with the options of: selling off its real estate portfolio entirely; closing its least profitable stores and selling the properties on which they were located, and thereafter operating a lower cost toy retailing business; or marketing Global Toys to buyers who might be well-equipped to execute on either of those strategies. To get a handle on the. true value of Global Toys, the board decided to get updated information on the value of its real estate holdings.</p>

As a result, the Executive Committee decided to put the idea of a Babies “R” Us spin-off on hold pending the outcome of the sales process. Among the reasons for that decision was the recognition that any buyer of the Global Toys business would expect to negotiate the terms on which Global Toys would provide transitional overhead services (like distribution, information systems, etc.) to Babies “R” Us after a sale. Another obvious reason was that there would be no need for a spin-off of Babies “R” Us if Global Toys was sold, because Babies “R” Us would then exist as a standalone company owned by the Company’s existing stockholders anyway.</p>

To the directors, it seemed entirely possible that the remaining bidders, who had invested in months and months of due diligence, and had submitted two rounds of multi-billion dollar “final bids,” might not tolerate the further delay that would result from a new market canvass and the inclusion of new parties who would have to do due diligence from scratch.</p>

This would give the board a chance at its March 16 meeting to either proceed with a sale of Global Toys, knowing that was the best alternative, or a sale of the whole Company.

The $26.75 per share bid also avoided serious execution and tax risks that the Company would have had to overcome in order to make the strategy of selling Global Toys, and continuing to operate Babies “R” Us generate a comparable, much less a superior, rate of return.

They are well-positioned to act impartially and better positioned than outside directors to act expertly. Such is also the case for directors who might, by affiliation with key industry partners of the company, or the company’s bankers, or by virtue of some other status, be deemed non-independent, but who may have the sort of expertise that is invaluable in shaping and implementing a profitable business strategy. Simply put, to be an inside or nonindependent director is not a crime, it is a status. And that fact cannot be forgotten by those who apply, or those who make, corporate law. To do otherwise is to risk boardrooms devoid of the very members with the best capacity to help management craft and implement a sound business plan.</p>

And, of course, First Boston is said to have undermined the board’s pursuit of the highest value by, among other things, failing to indicate in autumn 2004 that several of the parties interested in Global Toys had said they also were interested in looking at a purchase of the whole Company. Up until the time when Cerberus offered $25.25 per share on the evening of March 7, 2005, First Boston did not advise abandonment of a focus on selling Global Toys and, if anything, urged the Company to stay the course and put the Global Toys deal to bed.</p>

Those risks included the possibility that Wal-Mart would come after infants next, and squeeze the margins of Babies “R” Us; the difficulty and cost of ending Babies “R” Us’s dependence on Global Toys; and the difficulty of figuring out how to dispose of the controlling, but not majority, interest in Toys Japan. To get the value depicted on First Boston’s chart, particularly the very top value, the Company had to successfully navigate all these risks.</p>
    <p id="b1040-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1040.16",1040,[1035,1263,751,590]]]'>There is no guarantee that Babies “R” Us will command a control premium later. It must first demonstrate its earnings capacity on a stand-alone basis. As alluded to above and as presented to the board on March 16, Babies “R” Us was heavily subsidized by Global Toys’ infrastructure. The board received information bearing on the separation expenses indicating that that corporate allocation of expenses to Babies “R” Us would be $85 million in 2005, and could increase further.</p>
    <p id="b1040-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1040.17",1040,[1034,1877,752,643]],["BL_1041.1",1041,[119,291,753,788]]]'>Second, plaintiffs’ model assumes that the most optimistic “up to” $15.75 value alluded to in the First Boston chart is a lock. It is not. That value comprised not just sale proceeds, but also a distribution of additional debt to be taken on by the surviving Babies “R” Us entity. Moreover, the possible profit from the Global Toys sale becomes jeopardized by the very act of signaling that Babies “R” Us would be marketed and sold after Global Toys was disposed of. With only Global Toys on the market, a buyer of Global Toys <a id="p1013" href="#p1013" data-label="1013" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1013</a>knew that it was getting a cooperative partner committed to working out shared infrastructure concerns over time in a way that best advantaged both companies. If Babies “R” Us was also to be sold, the potential buyer of Global Toys would price into its offer the fact that its infrastructure partner was unknown, and might potentially be uncooperative. Worse, the potential buyer of Global Toys might be compelled by contract to provide a competitor with infrastructure services during a contentious and extended workout — a condition that reasonably might cause a discount in bids. Potential purchasers of Babies “R” Us, of course, would face similar concerns.</p>

Once Global Toys was sold, the Company’s stockholders would own shares in a corporation that was functionally Babies “R” Us. Those shares would trade on a minority basis in the marketplace. Under that scenario, Company stockholders would not have access to a control premium on Babies “R” Us until it was sold, in an indefinite time frame sometime in the future. The board, of course, had looked at valuation analyses — the First Boston and Duff &amp; Phelps valuations — that examined whether the $26.75 per share for the whole Company (including Babies “R” Us) was attractive in light of the control premiums paid for comparable companies in acquisitions. By this comparison, the $26.75 per share looked like an excellent, value-maximizing deal.</p>

The improbability of that scenario is deepened by another business reality. The sales process for Global Toys had revealed that financial buyers thought there was a value to the synergistic operation of Global Toys and Babies “R” Us. Those synergies would not be sold under this scenario — a new, higher cost Babies “R” Us operation would be.</p>
    <p id="b1041-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1041.9",1041,[918,1315,752,1230]]]'>But even if that business might have fetched a healthy control premium, the board’s choice to sell the whole Company for $26.75 cannot be second-guessed as unreasoned. In this regard, I note my demurrer from First Boston’s indication that its valuation of Babies “R” Us did not include a control premium in the first place. It is not my understanding that a DCF valuation conducted using the Gordon growth model, as First Boston’s updated DCF did, embeds a minority discount. Rather, that value is a value of the entity itself. Adding a control premium on top of a DCF is not, to this mind, intuitively or theoretically logical. Indeed, because a DCF model of the kind I have described is not infected by a minority discount, it is the model most consistent with what the Company’s stockholders would receive in an appraisal, their pro rata share of the Company’s value. For this reason, the board of Toys “R” Us had before it precisely the kind of information our Supreme Court has said it should have.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_57" id="ref_footnote_1_57">57</a>

This fear, Subramanian points out, is further exacerbated by the common circumstance that first bidders often have superior information on the target, and presumably know when to say when.

Notably, the plaintiffs have dropped any claim that the merger vote ought to be enjoined because the proxy statement is materially misleading.

In working back to the DCF implied value, I have assumed 226,000,-000 outstanding shares. Combined with the DCF high-end value of $2,375 billion, this implies a per share value of $10.51, or 38&lt;t more than the high-end value produced by the composite range.

On March 16, 2005, the board voted unanimously to amend the Company's 1999 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, clarifying that options granted under that plan would immediately vest in the event of a change of corporate control. The timing of this amendment, mere hours before the board actually voted to turn over control of the Company, may seem questionable at first blush. But because the Company's policies concerning employee stock options also called for immediate vesting upon change of control, the March 16 amendment simply confirmed that the non-employee directors and employee directors would receive equal treatment. In view of the many hours the independent directors devoted to the strategic process, it is unsurprising that even the plaintiffs do not argue that this was actually unfair.</p>

Commentators on corporate governance have expressed the belief — and Delaware courts have concurred — that stock options, when used and designed prudently, can help align insiders’ interests with those of public shareholders, because it gives insiders an incentive to increase the value of the company’s shares. <em>See, e.g., In re Oracle Corp., </em><a href="/a2d/867/0904-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="867 A.2d 904" data-case-ids="9028529" data-case-paths="/a2d/867/0904-01">867 A.2d 904</a>, 930 n. 115 &amp; 116 (Del.Ch.2004) (citing authorities), <em>aff'd, <a href="/citations/?q=872%20A.2d%20960" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="872 A.2d 960">872 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=872%20A.2d%20960" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="872 A.2d 960">A.2d 960</a> (Del.2005) (Table). Those incentive effects, alas, can also exacerbate the worst instincts of poorly motivated insiders, and perhaps dull the monitoring incentives of independent directors, whose beguilement at rising stock prices (which might simply be the result of accounting gimmickry) might distract them from a concentration on sound financial practices and the need to produce genuine profits through the sale of actual goods and services ... but that, as they say, is a whole nother story.</p>

By stating this, I do not want to be perceived as making a bright-line statement. One can imagine a process When a board decides to sell an entire division or the whole company, and when the board obtains a commitment from its financial advisor to provide a certain amount of financing to any bidder, in order to induce more bidders to take the risk of an acquisition. These and other scenarios might exist when roles on both sides for the investment banker, would be wholly consistent with the best interests of the primary client company. In general, however, it is advisable that investment banks representing sellers not create the appearance that they desire buy-side work, especially when it might be that they are more likely to be selected by some buyers for that lucrative role than by others.</p>

Based on what appears-to be a very simplistic and incomplete understanding of the facts, McAfee fails to see the rationale for a variety of tactical choices made by the board and its advisors. But McAfee did not seriously evaluate the real world situation the board faced and then opine that he, knowing the actual risks that alternative decisions involved, would have acted differently. I illustrate later in this section just one of the many forks in the road that McAfee did not precisely describe, much less choose between.</p>

In his affidavits, Subramanian, over a period of days, presented different calculations of the average percentage of equity and enterprise value that termination fees constituted in a sample of public company deals. In his most recent affidavit, Subrama-nian claimed that he and other scholars had been relying on inconsistent calculations from a leading source of data. There is no way for me, or the defendants, to stop the injunction clock and conduct a rational exploration of this midnight-hour contention. The reality that even distinguished scholars often have to refine their initially published arguments and policy recommendations, even though they have a more leisurely period of tíme to come up with them in the first place, might suggest that more empathy is due to fiduciaries who must, by business necessity, make difficult choices in the faster-moving context of real world commerce. This is not to say that scholarly work should not inform a fiduciary’s, or the judiciary’s, thinking. It should, but in a measured way that recognizes the necessarily imprecise and arguable nature of most "social science” research.</p>

In so venturing, I never indicated that this court could strike down such measures as final relief on a paper record involving disputed facts. Moreover, there is a good deal to be said for the notion that this court should simply enjoin a merger agreement’s closing preliminarily if it finds that the deal protection measures threaten the irreparable preclusion of materially higher bids or the coercion of a stockholder vote. That creates an incentive for acquirors to be more modest in the first instance, as they risk more if they overreach, and also leaves to the proper parties the opportunity for a new round of bargaining. This case, however, does not require me to decide between the various remedial approaches that might be warranted in any particular case.</p>
