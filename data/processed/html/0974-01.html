    <p id="b1011-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1011.6",1011,[114,1083,754,1097]]]'>¶ 5 Appellant here argues that the definition of <em>abuse </em>specifically limits the application of the statute to conduct that occurs “between family or household members, sexual or intimate partners or persons who share biological parenthood,” and that his relationship to appellee does not fit within any of those described relationships. We disagree. Here, both appellant and appel-lee have a direct blood relationship to the child, and by extension are inextricably linked to each other by that relationship.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In fact, the parties are more directly related by consanguinity than the in-law relationship that was deemed adequate to invoke the protection of the Act in <em>McCance v.
