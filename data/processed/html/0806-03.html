This trend has been marked by a move away from a tutorial and habilitative emphasis, toward more punishment and correctional oriented policies for juvenile offenders. Many states have removed certain categories of serious offenses from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and placed them within the jurisdiction of the criminal court. The recent amendments to Pennsylvania’s Juvenile Act are a reflection of these societal and legal trends. With this background and the above-stated principles in mind, we review the pertinent provisions of the Juvenile Act.</p>

The juvenile is the party in the best position to produce evidence to the contrary, which, most often, will include lay testimony by family members, teachers, or other adult acquaintances, and expert psychological and psychiatric testimony. Federal due process guarantees are not impinged on where the Legislature requires, by way of a rebuttable presumption of the type in § 61, ..., <em>supra, </em>that the juvenile assume the initial burden of producing evidence that he is not dangerous and should have his ease remain within the juvenile justice system.</blockquote>

A juvenile is not even constitutionally entitled to a hearing before transfer to adult court. In light of this history, we conclude that a legislature may completely exclude certain serious offenses from juvenile court jurisdiction. The legislature may also place the burden of proof on the juvenile to rebut the strong presumption of unfitness for juvenile treatment created by the statute. We conclude that this classification scheme is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. The legislature may quite rationally assume that a juvenile who has committed a serious crime poses a danger to the community and probably may not be amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile system.</blockquote>

Although the issues raised by appellant do not directly challenge the filing of the charges in this case in adult criminal court, we nonetheless find that they do implicate the issue of jurisdiction. The question of transfer is ultimately a determination of whether the criminal court or the juvenile court will exercise jurisdiction over a juvenile’s case. As such, the waiver doctrine is inapplicable. In any event, the plea agreement specifically reserved to appellant the right to appeal the denial of the constitutional issues raised in his petition for habeas corpus. <em>Commonwealth v.
