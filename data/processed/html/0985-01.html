On the way back to the arcade, Corley gave W.P. a ring and kissed her. Corley later told W.P. that he had to return a backpack to a friend’s apartment nearby and asked her to join him. W.P. testified that she was apprehensive about the sojourn, but accompanied Corley at his insistence.</p>

W.P. told Corley that he was “moving too fast” and that she “just wanted to be friends.” N.T. 5/19/92, at 15. Corley continued his advances in the hallway outside of the apartment and W.P. resisted again, still proclaiming that she wanted to be friends. Corley then told W.P. that since his friend was not home, he wanted to put the backpack in the laundry room next door. He also asked her to go into the room with him because he wanted to talk to her. W.P. acquiesced and Corley turned off the lights and shut the door. He then propped W.P. on top of a dryer and forcibly removed her clothes. He began licking W.P.’s chest and she began to cry. Corley told her that if she screamed or cried loudly, he would “break her fucking neck.” According to W.P., he then masturbated, ejaculated on her leg, twice performed oral sex on her, attempted to coerce her to perform oral sex on him, and had intercourse with her.</p>

She then asked Corley to have sex, to which he responded that he had a wife and would not philander. He claimed that W.P. began to cry at this point, that he tried to console her, and that he regretted having gone too far. He denied that he stripped W.P. of any clothing or forcibly performed oral sex on her. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts, making it apparent that the jurors lent more credibility to W.P.’s account of the events than it did Corley’s.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The trial court’s instruction, insofar as it referred to Corley’s prior criminal activity, was error because it did not explain why the evidence was admitted and, furthermore, allowed the jury to conclude that Cor-ley was convicted of prior rapes — an improper use of the statements no matter how one looks at it.</p>

[T]his testimony if’it be accepted by the jury, that is to be believed, must be used for the sole purpose it was offered. That was to show why the will of [the victim] was overcome to make that act of intercourse and possibly later involuntary deviate sexual relations without her consent_ The general rule is that evidence of prior criminal acts cannot be considered by a jury in determining guilt for the act of that which defendant is presently being tried. On the other hand, although this evidence was generally inadmissible it was permitted to be received because it may tend to prove, if believed, one of the necessary elements that the Commonwealth must establish beyond a reasonable doubt for both the offense of rape and involuntary deviate sexual relations. That is, taking the act that it is claimed or acts that are claimed to be performed as to whether or not the will of the defendant [sic] was overcome ... [t]he testimony of the defendant’s alleged prior involvement in a rape is to be considered only for what affect [sic] it had on a person <a id="p990" href="#p990" data-label="990" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*990</a>of reasonable resolution to determine whether or not that by itself or with the other acts* the pointing of the gun if that occurred, the physical force if that occurred, or whatever it was that overcame her resistance, if it did, would have done so as to a person of reasonable resolution.

Here, the trial court allowed W.P. to testify regarding Corley’s statement about the prior rapes and did not caution the jury during her testimony that the evidence had a limited use. Defense counsel, however, sat silently. During the jury charge, likewise, counsel did not ask for a specific <em>Claypool </em>instruction, nor did he seek to narrow the scope of the trial court’s “impeachment” instruction.
