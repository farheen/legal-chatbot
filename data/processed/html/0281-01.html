She commenced the instant custody action on December 23, 1994 by filing a complaint for custody and a petition for special relief in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The petition for special relief was granted on an emergency basis <em>ex parte </em>and on December 23, 1994, the Montgomery County court entered an order awarding custody to Mother “on a temporary basis, without prejudice” pending further order of court. Service upon Father of the complaint for custody and the petition for special relief, accompanied by the court’s order, was accomplished on January 16, 1995.

We agree with the trial court that Belgium meets the UCCJA definition of home state, since the children had lived there for their entire lives prior to December, 1994. However, this court has frequently made it clear that the determination of “home state” does not end the inquiry.

Mother has alleged that Father intends to move from Belgium to Turkey at some time iñ the near future. In support of this allegation, she testified that Father has purchased a home in Turkey, maintains a bank account there, and has forced the family to associate primarily with other Turks in Belgium and to maintain and promote Turkish culture in the home to the exclusion of American culture. Father did not deny his intention to move to Turkey or his preparations to do so, but testified that he does not intend to move immediately and that the preparations he has made in Turkey were to facilitate the family’s move there if at some time in the next few years he should lose his NATO job due to reductions in force. He also testified that while he encourages his children to learn about Turkish culture, he does not prevent them from speaking English, viewing American videotapes, or having American or English friends.

Their mother was born in Pennsylvania and resided here until her marriage. Moreover, the children themselves have been physically present in Pennsylvania since December of 1994 and have attended school in Pennsylvania since January, 1994.

It is also available in Belgium. However, if, as Mother alleges, Father intends to leave Belgium in the near future, the significance of the records available in Belgium as a factor in determining jurisdiction is substantially weakened. In that situation, the Belgian records would apply only to the children’s <em>past </em>care, protection, training and personal relationships, and would have little probative value on issues relevant to the children’s welfare in Turkey or some other country where they might reside in the future.</p>

They resided for much of their lives on the NATO base, an international community set apart from the mainstream of Belgian society. The schools that they attended were also affiliated with NATO and were not part of the Belgian school system. The children do not speak French, the primary language of Belgium, and their friendships in Belgium, like those of their parents, were mostly with individuals of Turkish, American or British citizenship.

The grant of a stay pending appellate review to ensure that the trial court’s jurisdictional determination was correct and that the children’s custody would be adjudicated by the court best able to determine their best interest was thus entirely in keeping with the public interest in this case.</p>

Section 5348(g) of the UCCJA provides that “[i]f it appears to the court that it is clearly an inappropriate forum, it may require the party who commenced the proceedings to pay, in addition to the costs of the proceedings in this Commonwealth, necessary travel and other expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by other parties or their witnesses.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 5348(g). In light of our discussion both of <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>Mother’s appeal and of the supersedeas issue raised by Father, it is apparent that this case is not one in which Pennsylvania is “clearly an inappropriate forum.” The unusual facts of this case make the determination of jurisdiction a particularly thorny issue. We thus cannot conclude that, despite the trial court’s resolution of the jurisdictional issue in Father’s favor, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that the resolution of this case was not so clear as to justify an award of costs to Father.</p>

    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[242,901,754,647]]]'>In light of the above discussion, we vacate the portion of the order which determined that jurisdiction of this custody dispute properly lies in Belgium, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with our discussion of Mother’s appeal. We affirm the portions of the trial court order granting the supersedeas and denying Father’s request for costs and fees. Pending a redetermination of jurisdiction on remand, the emergency order granting mother temporary custody, entered by the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas on December 28, 1994, is reinstated.</p>

Although this motion is referred to in the transcript of the March 6 hearing and Mother has included a copy of the motion in her supplemental reproduced record, the original record certified by the trial court does not include the motion and the trial court docket entries do not reflect that such a motion was filed. It thus appears that although the motion was served on the trial court and the opposing party, it was never properly filed with the Prothonotary. However, since the trial court granted relief on the basis of the petition, we will overlook this procedural defect and review the trial court’s grant of the motion on its merits.</p>

The agreement provided that she would not begin divorce proceedings in the United States, that she would return the children to Israel, and that custody of the children would be decided by an Israeli court. Mrs. Hovav’s actions in retaining the children and seeking a determination of custody were thus clearly wrongful. Mrs. Dincer, in contrast, violated no express agreement by remaining in the United States and instituting a custody action in Pennsylvania. Moreover, she testified that she did not leave Belgium with the intention of remaining in Pennsylvania with the children, but rather that she decided that she could not return to the marital home after she arrived here. Her actions, while unexpected and perhaps not commendable, thus were not clearly wrongful.</blockquote>

Here, as will become clear in the discussion below, the allegations that Mr. Dincer intends to leave Belgium are central to a proper consideration of Pennsylvania's connection with the children and thus to a proper determination of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

The trial court's finding that the March 1 Belgian order granting custody to Father was a predetermination of custody which must be given comity is clearly in error. The March 1 order entered by the Belgian court was "provisional” pending further hearings, and was not that court’s final determination of custody based upon a full consideration of the children's best interests. This temporary order of the Belgian court, entered <em>after </em>a similar emergency order by the Montgomery County court, thus need not be given the deference due to a final determination.</p>
