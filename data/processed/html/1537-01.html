After conviction, he applied for release under <em>habeas corpus </em>and was discharged. The city appealed and claimed that the tax in question was-against the purely, local business done within the City of Miami and did not apply to the interstate commerce business of the said telegraph company in which said agent was engaged. It was held that the tax as imposed was not excessive or unreasonable as being a tax upon the intrastate business conducted in the City of Miami, and that a State or Municipal government in the State could tax as a franchise or privilege the doing of domestic business by a telegraph company which was also engaged at the same time and place in conducting interstate commerce business; but the Court clearly indicated that if such tax could be held as a matter of law to apply as a burden upon interstate commerce business,, the ordinance imposing the tax would be invalid.</p>

In the Pembina case, a corporation, incorporated under the laws of Colorado for the purpose of doing a general mining and milling business in that State, had an office in Philadelphia for "the use of its officers, stockholders, agents and employees.’’ The State of Pennsylvania through its proper officers assessed a tax against the corporation for "office license,” which the company resisted.

Appellant maintained its principal office in Missouri, where it kept its books and bank accounts, and from which it paid its employees within and without the State, purchased supplies, employed labor, maintained telephone and telegraph lines, entered into contracts for transportation of crude oil and carried on <a id="p1549" href="#p1549" data-label="1549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1549</a>various other activities connected with and in furtherance of its pipe line operations.

Freight moneys collected, after deducting commissions, were remitted to the owners or charterers. As such agent, the transport company’was authorized to solicit cargo and quote freight rates and to issue! receipts in the name of its principal for cargo delivered on the wharves.
