The informant described Brown as a white male, age 27 to 28, standing 5'9" to 5'11", and weighing 150 to 160 pounds. He also stated Brown would be carrying a gun and driving a mid-1990s Ford Taurus with a specific license plate number. Officer McDonnell went to the intersection at the specified time and observed Brown, who matched the informant’s description, driving the vehicle the informant described. He watched Brown leave the vehicle empty-handed, return several minutes later, place a brown paper bag in the trunk, and drive away.</p>

After obtaining a warrant to search the vehicle, officers discovered various other prescription drugs and a handgun in the trunk, as well as a notebook entitled “Thomas Brown money list” in the glove compartment. Brown was charged with possession with intent to deliver prescription pills and other offenses arising from the stop. Brown filed a pretrial motion to suppress all physical evidence seized. At the suppression hearing, Officer McDonnell testified he “used” the informant before, but gave no specifics as to the informant’s reliability; Brown presented no evidence.

Listing an informant’s history is one way to give credence to the information — a common way to be sure — but it is not the only way. Moreover, leaping to the conclusion that the information was never found to be reliable is not warranted. The record indicates the 13-year veteran police officer previously used the informant. Logically, if the information was <em>“not </em>ever found to be reliable,” the officer would <em>not </em>have followed up on his information here. <em><a href="/a2d/735/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="735 A.2d 87" data-case-ids="11533687,56811" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0087-01,/pa/557/0570-01">Id.</a> </em>The fact the officer did so bespeaks some measure of confidence in the information, not the contrary.</p>

Simply because the officer did not delineate reasons to find the informant credible beyond a prior unde-tailed “usage” does not render the informant the legal equivalent of anonymous.

The informant in this case was not anonymous, and the tip consisted of more than mere description.
