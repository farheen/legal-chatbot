If the hollowed out portion in the bracket were all that is involved we would agree with the board, but the application discloses also a hole through the bottom or center of the depression extending forwardly through the bracket. Having in mind the rule that the counts must be given their broadest reasonable interpretation, we think that the depression, together with said hole extending through the bracket, responds to the words of the counts, “ having an opening near the lower end ” of the bracket.</p>

We think the board is correct in this holding. Assuming that the member described in the application is a trunnion, it is clearly not rigid with the base, but it is adjustable, the means of adjustment being a nut on the end of the member. While it is true that in one position it is rigid, it is made so only by the use of the nut, and it remains rigid ■only -so long as this nut holds its place.</p>

Furthermore, the specification of said application describes the member serving the purpose of a trunnion as “ adjustably mounted in an opening,” and it states that the member “may be adjusted to shift the joint axially of the bracket A and to vary the tension of the spring B.” We think it would be an unreasonable interpretation of the counts to hold that the application disclosed a “ trun-ion rigid with said base.”</p>

We may add, however, that count 2 describes a <em>“ </em>tie rod extending through said opening.” Upon this point the Board of Appeals said:</p>

"We do not see how with any interpretation of the language of count <em>2 </em>it can be said of the serial No. 341887 construction that the tie rod 16 extends through an opening.</blockquote>

In count 5 the description is: “A base having projections formed on the edges thereof and extending laterally therefrom.” For the reasons'stated in our discussion of this, element in other counts we agree with the board that application of serial No. 341887 does not support this feature of count 5.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[130,689,507,41]]]'>Count No. 6 reads in part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[86,757,1323,73]]]'>In an automatic train pipe coupling, a base having a projection extending laterally from each side thereof near its lower end.</blockquote>
    <p id="b611-7" data-blocks='[["BL_611.7",611,[87,856,1323,194]]]'>The Board of Appeals held that while application serial No. 341887 responded to all the other portions of said count 6, it did not respond to the feature therein above quoted. In its holding, however, it considered counts 4, 5, and 6 together and said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b611-8" data-blocks='[["BL_611.8",611,[88,1078,1324,158]]]'>Bach of these counts includes in some form or other the limitations to a projection or projections extending from an edge or edges of the base. This we think is not disclosed in application serial No. 341887. While the parts 9 and 10 constitute projections broadly, they do not project from an edge.</blockquote>
    <p id="b611-9" data-blocks='[["BL_611.9",611,[89,1261,1325,693]]]'>The board failed to note that count 6 makes no reference to the edge or edges of the base, but describes a base “ having a projection extending laterally from each side thereof near its lower end.” We think, however, that the use of the word “ side ” in this count conveys the same idea as the word “ edge ” in the other counts that we have discussed. While the specification in said application serial No. 341887 refers to the lower end of the bracket being provided with transversely extending lugs or bosses, it is nowhere shown or intimated that they extend from each side of the base. The descriptions in the specification are somewhat conflicting as to what constitutes the bracket or base, but the fair construction is that the projections, if any may be so termed, there shown are either independent of the1 base or a part thereof. In any event, they do not extend “laterally from each side thereof near its lower end.”</p>
    <p id="b611-10" data-blocks='[["BL_611.10",611,[93,1961,1323,434]]]'>Counts 7 and 8 will be considered together for they each contain the element of a trunnion rigid with the bracket. This element has been fully discussed in our consideration of interference No. 51124, in which this same feature was involved in the counts there in issue. We there held that application serial No. 341887 does not disclose a trunnion rigid with the bracket, and of course it follows that we come to the same conclusion as to this feature of counts 7 and 8. In view of this holding it is unnecessary to consider other features of said counts 7 and 8.</p>
