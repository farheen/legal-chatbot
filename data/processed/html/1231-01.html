Mrs. Field’s body was wrapped in a rug and the cause of her death was blunt force trauma to the head. State police investigating . the crime learned that in mid-1999, when the victim was first reported missing by her mother, Field enlisted the help of a friend to remove a rolled-up rug from his house in Lehigh County and take it to his jewelry store in Northampton County. Field told his friend that his wife had left him.</p>
    <p id="b1270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1270.9",1270,[196,1656,757,873]]]'>¶ 3 Police ultimately filed a criminal complaint against Field in Northampton County charging him with the murder of his wife. Following a, preliminary hearing at which Field was held for court, he filed a pretrial omnibus motion alleging, among other things, that his case should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Field specifically asserted that “all evidence within the possession of the Commonwealth indicates and suggests that the victim, Theresa Field, was killed within the County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania and not within the County of Northampton, Pennsylvania, and as a result, jurisdiction is properly within the County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania.</p>

The medical examiner stated that the blows the victim sustained probably would have caused her death within seconds to minutes, and likely in less than an hour. Noting the Commonwealth’s concession that the blows occurred in Lehigh County, as well as testimony regarding the time it takes to drive to Northampton County, Field argued that the victim’s death must have occurred in Lehigh County.</p>

Section 102’s plain language sets, out the circumstances under which criminal defendants may be subjected to the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania courts. The law provides that a person may be convicted in the Commonwealth if, among other things, 1) his conduct, which is an element of the offense or the result of which is such an element, occurred within the state. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 102(a)(1).

In so finding, the trial court relied on <em>Commonwealth v. Kirkland, </em><a href="/a2d/700/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="700 A.2d 482" data-case-ids="11899901" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0482-01">700 A.2d 482</a> (Pa.Super.1997) and <em>Commonwealth v.

We find neither case helpful to our analysis of this homicide matter and rely instead on the specific statutory provision, 18 Pa.C.S.A. 102(c), addressing homicide cases.</p>
    <p id="b1271-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1271.9",1271,[925,1183,753,555]]]'>¶ 12 In <em>Bradfield, </em>the panel held that trial was proper in the county in which the body was found and noted that the presumption in § 102(c) was not rebutted “merely because [the victim] was last seen alive in [another] county.” <em>Bradfield, </em><a href="/pa-super/352/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="352 Pa.

Where, as here, the exact time of death is unknown, the Commonwealth must be permitted to bring charges in the county in which the body is discovered. Because the victim is dead, the specific facts surrounding the murder may never be ascertained.

Our decision does not prevent Field from seeking to have this case tried in Lehigh County based on his claim that the evidence tends to establish that the crime occurred there. Indeed, this precise claim was the basis for Field’s motion to dismiss the charges altogether. When the prosecutor stated on the record that he would not oppose (and in fact would join) Field’s request for a change of venue to Lehigh County, Field’s counsel stated that he had no pending request for a venue change and would not seek one. This position, when considered against Field's previous claims that Lehigh County was the proper county for trial, is difficult to understand. It was followed by the Commonwealth seeking appellate review based on double jeopardy concerns.</p>
