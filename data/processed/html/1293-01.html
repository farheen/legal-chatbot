      <em>Smith </em>involved a multi-count indictment charging appellant with bribery, threats and obstruction of justice. The jury acquitted him on the bribery and threats counts, and hung on the obstruction of justice count which the government sought to retry.</p>

This question was not before the <em>Smith </em>court and we think the answer is patently clear. We know of no differences in the elements of proof required for conviction under the two counts of second degree murder and the government has been unable to cite us to any. At trial, the court and both counsel agreed that convictions on both counts could not stand, with which view we agree.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/432/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="432 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6177531" data-case-paths="/us/432/0137-01">432 U.S. 137</a>, 154, <a href="/us/432/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="432 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6177531" data-case-paths="/us/432/0137-01">97 S.Ct. 2207</a>, 2218, <a href="/us/432/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="432 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6177531" data-case-paths="/us/432/0137-01">53 L.Ed.2d 168</a> (1977). Therefore, I agree with the majority that the jury’s verdict of not guilty of second-degree murder as a lesser-included offense of felony murder is a bar to retrial for second-degree murder as a lesser-included offense of premeditated murder.</p>
    <p id="b1356-19" data-blocks='[["BL_1356.21",1356,[1000,1773,749,420]]]'>I further note that it was improper to instruct the jury to consider second-degree murder under both the premeditated murder and felony murder counts. <em>United States v.

The problem we have here should be avoided in the future by allowing the jury to consider only one count of second-degree murder.</p>
