On November 3, 1992, Didi Dessaints, a clerk for Hardie, claims that she orally ordered a boom truck for two days at $330.00 per day from Inquipco at the request of Rodney Hysell, a maintenance foreman for Hardie.</p>
    <p id="b581-16" data-blocks='[["BL_581.16",581,[198,2056,1121,310]],["BL_582.1",582,[209,278,1118,130]]]'>Robert Cancellieri, of Inquipco, promptly directed his office to prepare an “Equipment Rental Agreement” (“the Agreement”), and to deliver the equipment. The Agreement was prepared by Inquipco, and was physically divided into parts separated by horizontal solid lines. The top portion consisted of a written contract containing terms and conditions and a reference to the reverse side for more terms and conditions. The top portion also <a id="p1400" href="#p1400" data-label="1400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1400</a>embodied a signature line. The bottom half allowed space for the entry of contractual terms specific to the parties involved. It also included a “Delivery Inspection by” signature line.</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.4",582,[207,413,1120,494]]]'>Wes Watson, an Inquipco employee, promptly delivered the truck to Hardie. Gary Gottula, a superintendent for Hardie, happened to meet Watson at the guard gate and told Watson to leave the truck there and he would receive it. Gottula claims that after he inspected the vehicle, Watson put a document (now known as the Agreement) before him. Without reading it, Gottula signed on the line indicating his inspection and receipt of delivery of the truck. Gottula testified that he thought the document was a “packing slip.” He claims he did not assent to any of the terms on the document, and that he intended his signature only to be evidence that he had inspected and received the equipment.</p>
    <p id="b582-5" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[204,912,1121,437]]]'>Gottula also testified that he was unaware that Dessaints had ordered the truck before it arrived, and that he did not accept the truck in his capacity as a superintendent. He claims that anyone, even the guards or secretaries, can receive deliveries, but are not authorized to sign equipment rental agreements. He also testified that he did have the authority to rent equipment, but was not exercising that authority in this case since Hysell rented this particular equipment. Gottula also testified that at some time prior to the oral agreement, he must have given Hysell approval to order the truck.</p>
    <p id="b582-6" data-blocks='[["BL_582.6",582,[204,1364,1120,221]]]'>On November 5, 1992, the truck was damaged while being operated by Hysell. Hysell died in the accident.

    <p id="b582-7" data-blocks='[["BL_582.7",582,[202,1592,1122,355]]]'>Larry Cox, the general manager of Inquipco, testified that Inquipco had the means to repair or replace the vehicle immediately, but chose to wait until February 28, 1994, almost sixteen months after the accident, to accept insurance proceeds and replace the vehicle. He claims they waited because Hardie’s counsel told him that the truck was defective, so he did not want to disturb the evidence. He also wanted Hardie to admit responsibility before repairing the truck.</p>

However, Inquipco withdrew its claim for property <a id="p1401" href="#p1401" data-label="1401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1401</a>damages after it accepted reimbursement from its insurance carrier and recommissioned the vehicle for use on February 28, 1994.</p>

The district court entered judgment in favor of Inquipco for lost rental damages of $43,200.00, transportation damages of $1,100.00, investigation damages of $3,150.00, attorney’s fees of $29,500.00, and court costs of $1,154.14. It was further ordered that the judgment bear interest beginning on November 5, 1992. This appeal ensued.</p>
