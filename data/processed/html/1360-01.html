Jackson, III (“Jackson”), was convicted of two counts of Murder First Degree, Burglary Second Degree, Conspiracy Second Degree, Robbery First Degree, and three counts of Possession of a Deadly Weapon during the Commission of a Felony. Following a sentencing hearing, the jury unanimously found that the State had established two statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and, by a vote of 11-1, found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances found to exist. 11 <em>DelC. </em>§ 4209(c)(3). The Superior Court judge, undertaking the required statutory analysis, reached the same ultimate conclusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> 11 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4209(d).

We find no error with respect to the guili/innocence phase of Jackson’s trial and therefore affirm his convictions. However, we conclude that Jackson’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, was violated by the introduction of taped conversations between Jackson and a state agent into evidence during the sentencing hearing. We cannot conclude that this constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the sentences of death are vacated and the matter is remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</p>

During the afternoon of April 3, 1992, Jackson and Anthony La-chette (“Lachette”) decided to burglarize a house in order to obtain money to buy marijuana. Lachette suggested they break into the home of Elizabeth Girardi. Lachette was familiar with the residence since he was acquainted with one of Mrs. Girardi’s children. No one was at home when the two broke into the house through the back door. Jackson wore a pair of gardening gloves he had brought with him. Once inside, the two gathered property that included jewelry, rare coins, compact discs, firecrackers, and a camera. After placing the stolen property in paper bags, Jackson and Lachette left the house the way they entered. As they headed toward the driveway, where Jackson had parked the car, they saw Mrs. Girardi, who had arrived home and was walking towards Jackson’s car. Lachette decided to flee despite Jackson’s attempt to persuade him to stay. Lachette then dropped his bag and ran off, leaving Jackson behind.</p>
    <p id="b1429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1429.5",1429,[162,1505,754,1036]]]'>After Lachette ran off, Jackson grabbed an ax from a shed and confronted Mrs. Gir-ardi in the driveway. A struggle ensued, during which Mrs. Girardi fell to the ground, whereupon Jackson struck her several times in the face with the ax. Jackson then loaded his ear with the stolen property. Before leaving, Jackson noticed that Mrs. Girardi was still alive. He struck her several more times in the face with the ax, killing her, and then left the scene. Shortly thereafter, Jackson found Lachette walking along the road and picked him up. Jackson then told La-chette that he had killed Mrs. Girardi. La-chette noticed blood on Jackson’s gloves and pant legs. Over the course of the next week, Jackson watched television news reports and spoke with Lachette and James Burton (“Burton”), his roommate and longtime friend, about the Girardi murder. During that time, Jackson told Burton that he had killed Mrs. Girardi.</p>

Pawn shop owners in the area had been alerted by the police to be on the lookout for certain pieces of property stolen from the Girardi residence. The pawn shop owner contacted the police, who, following an investigation, obtained warrants authorizing the search of Burton’s and Roca’s residences and also authorizing the police to take Burton and Roca into custody to obtain clothing, fingerprints, and hair and blood samples from their persons.</p>
    <p id="b1429-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1429.8",1429,[961,734,757,1570]]]'>When the police arrived at Burton’s residence, they learned from his parents that he had moved out and was living with Jackson. Conducting surveillance in the area near Burton’s and Jackson’s apartment, police observed Burton and two companions enter a car and drive off. The police followed, eventually stopping the car for two motor vehicle violations. Lachette was driving, Jackson was in the front passenger seat, and Burton was in the rear seat. Upon opening the driver’s door, the police observed a 14-inch metal pipe partially concealed between the driver’s seat and door. After Lachette exited the vehicle, the police folded the driver’s seat-back forward to allow Burton access to the door. Upon doing this, a plastic bag containing marijuana was discovered in the folding area where the seat-back and cushion meet. All three of the vehicle’s occupants, including Jackson, were then arrested for carrying a concealed deadly weapon and possession of marijuana. Before placing Jackson in a holding cell, the police, pursuant to standard procedures, removed certain articles of property and clothing from his person, including his sneakers. Later that night, when police discovered that Lachette and Jackson were involved in the Girardi burglary/homieide, the sneakers were seized as evidence. The sole of one of Jackson’s sneakers was later determined to be consistent with foot prints found at the murder scene.</p>

Since the trial judge is the ultimate sentencer under Delaware’s revised death penalty statute, 11 <em>Del.

Accordingly, Jackson concludes, he was improperly demed a trial by an impartial jury of a cross-section of Ms peers. Jackson acknowledges that tMs Court rejected an identical argument in <em>State v.

When police later learned that Jackson was involved in the Girardi murder, the sneakers were seized as evidence. The evidentiary value of the sneakers was twofold: they had spots of human blood on them, and the sole of one of the sneakers matched a footprint left at the murder scene. Jackson argues that police did not have probable cause to arrest him on the weapons and drug charges, and therefore, the sneakers, fruit of an illegal arrest, were improperly admitted into evidence.

In <em>Di Re, </em>the United States Supreme Court, applying a New York statute somewhat similar to 11 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 1904, found no probable cause existed to arrest the defendant, on whose person counterfeit gasoline ration coupons were subsequently found. There, police had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was going to buy counterfeit gasoline coupons from one Buttitta at a certain place. The police located Buttitta’s car at the designated place and found Reed in the back seat holding gasoline ration coupons which later proved to be counterfeit. Upon being asked, Reed said he obtained them from Buttitta, who was in the driver’s seat. Di Re was in the front passenger seat and was not implicated by Reed. There was no indication that any contraband was located in the automobile itself, apart from that on the person of one of its occupants. Di Re was nonetheless arrested, and on his person police found counterfeit gas ration coupons. He was subsequently convicted on federal charges stemming from their possession.</p>

Two days later, Jackson told Taimo that he wanted Burton killed, and was attempting to arrange for bail in order to facilitate the murder plot. On September 21, Detective McClaren interviewed Taimo, presumably at Gander Hill. While the record is unclear, it appears that Taimo told McClaren that he was keeping a diary and had been given a photo of Burton and a map to his residence, but eventually Jackson took back <a id="p1370" href="#p1370" data-label="1370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1370</a>the photo and map. Apparently, McClaren did not ask Taimo to elicit information regarding the Girardi murder, but did ask Tai-mo to obtain information about the plot to kill Burton.</p>

The next day, the State abandoned its plan to obtain a wire tap on the telephone of Jackson’s mother, and instead decided to accept Johnson’s offer of assistance. Taimo was apparently placed “on a back burner” at that time, in part because the amount of his bail had been increased and he was still in custody. In late February 1993, Jackson sent Taimo a letter with a map to Burton’s residence and, in code, asked Taimo to have Burton killed. Taimo again made contact with the State and was ultimately provided with recording equipment by Detective McClaren and asked to record his telephone conversations with Jackson. Taimo taped two phone calls from Jackson in March 1993, during the early phase of Jackson’s trial, and turned the tapes over to the State.</p>

The Court observed, in its only mention of the Sixth Amendment, that "no charges had been filed on the subject of the interrogation, and our Sixth Amendment precedents <em>[Massiah, Henry, </em>and <em>Moulton </em>] are not applicable." <a href="/us/496/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="307" data-cite="496 U.S. 292" data-case-ids="12122654" data-case-paths="/us/496/0292-01">496 U.S. at 299</a>, <a href="/us/496/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="308" data-cite="496 U.S. 292" data-case-ids="12122654" data-case-paths="/us/496/0292-01">110 S.Ct. at 2398</a>.
