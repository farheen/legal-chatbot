On April 14, 1998, Mr. Bethea, Appellee herein, delivered 12 grams of crack cocaine to a confidential informant in exchange for $400. The exchange occurred at a business establishment known as “All That Stuff’, located at 3 North Earl Street, in Shippensburg, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. As a result of this incident in Cumberland County Appellee was arrested on August 21,1998 and charged with delivery of a controlled substance, 35 P.S. § 780-113(30), and conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 903.

In his statement of matters complained of on appeal, he raised three issues, all of which challenged the ineffective assistance of trial counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ap-pellee argued that trial counsel was ineffective for 1) failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence at the preliminary hearing; 2) failing to challenge the evidence by filing a habeas corpus or suppression motion; and 3) failing to object to improper <em>venue. </em>The trial court found all three ineffectiveness claims to be without merit. As to the final issue challenging venue, the trial court agreed that venue was not proper in Franklin County. However, the court went on to consider whether Appellee had suffered prejudice by having the matter tried before a jury chosen in Franklin, rather than Cumberland, County. The court observed that Appellee failed to assert any specific claim of prejudice stemming from the location of the trial. Further, the trial court noted that Franklin and Cumberland are neighboring counties and that the residents share similar socioeconomic backgrounds. In conclusion, the trial court found that Appellee suffered no prejudice from trial counsel’s failure to object to venue. (Opinion of Walker, J„ filed 1/4/2000, p. 3).</p>

C.S. § 110. Looking at the circumstances in the present case, the Superior Court majority found that, since the drug charges and the habitual offender violation were not part of a single criminal episode, the charges could not be consolidated under § 110, and the reasoning in <em>McPhail </em>was not applicable. <em>Bethea, </em><a href="/a2d/761/1181-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="761 A.2d 1181" data-case-ids="11163317" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/1181-01">761 A.2d at 1183</a>.</p>

Therefore, where there is only one criminal episode, the question is one of venue, not jurisdiction.

This error by the Superior Court led it to incorrectly review the present legal challenge as one involving subject matter jurisdiction, when in fact the issue is purely one of venue. Finally, when viewed as a question of venue, and specifically as a claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge venue, the claim fails, as Ap-pellee cannot establish prejudice.</p>

Appellee does not believe the Superior Court erred in deciding this case as one raising a claim of subject matter jurisdiction, since venue is a question of subject matter jurisdiction. The error in venue reflects a unilateral action by the prosecutor to alter the venue of this case without having to show good cause for its action. <em>Commonwealth v.

Yet, in the present case, the two charges have absolutely nothing in common.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> They arise out of entirely different types of conduct that took place on two different occasions in two different counties. Thus, there is no relationship between Appellee’s criminal conduct and the county where he is being tried, as nothing links Franklin County (and, consequently, the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County) to Ap-pellee’s drug charges. In fact, there is no evidence that Appellee did anything in Franklin County to warrant prosecution on drug-related charges in that county. Even so, the rationale of the Majority allows the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County to adjudicate Appellee’s guilt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> As I pointed out in <em>McPhail, </em>this analysis is intrinsically flawed, because it disregards the well-established “locus of the crime” principle and facilitates prosecutorial forum shopping.</p>
