The claims stemmed from nearly seven hundred demonstrably unrecoverable loans, which were made by Boll-ing's agents as$ertedly in derogation of the organization’s policy. Rather than commit the resources necessary to investigate these claims and defend a resultant lawsuit,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Cumis offered a settlement. Bolling agreed, signed a release dated February 7, 1980, and accepted payment of $250,000.

The majority’s reading of the release gives no effect to this language. Moreover, if, as the majority suggests, this release was intended to encompass claims arising from losses that accrued both before and after the date of its execution, I would charge Cumis with responsibility for articulating and bargaining for language that made clear this exceedingly broad purpose. Such a purpose could easily have been memorialized by simply referring to all claims arising both before and after the release date with respect to loans made by a specified group of employees. Thus, the flaw in the majority’s analysis is twofold: first, it violates a cardinal principle of interpreting contracts by rendering meaningless one of the terms expressly included by the parties, Restatement (Second) of ContRacts § 203(a) (1979); and, second, it reads the release to have an expansive meaning which the parties easily could have expressed but did not.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
