Because the religious schools are not participating in this case, those issues are not central to our decision-making. However, it is possible to envision that there may be conflicts between state curriculum, record keeping and anti-discrimination requirements and religious teachings and religious practices in some schools. These conflicts could result in significant entanglement of State education officials in religious matters if religious schools were to begin to receive public tuition funds and the State moves to enforce its various compliance requirements on the religious schools. This concern to avoid excessive entanglements provides a rational basis to maintain the funding limitation in section 2951(2).

However, there is no question that the issue presented for decision by this action is a question of great public concern and an issue that repeatedly arises for parents of children attending high school in communities that tuition their high school students to other public and private high schools. Thus, this case appropriately proceeds under generally recognized exceptions to the mootness doctrine. <em>See Consumers for Affordable Health Care, Inc. v.

Indeed, until the early 1980s and prior to the existence of section 2951(2), which was enacted to comply with the then current understanding of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, section 5204 allowed tuition payments to parents who chose to send their children to sectarian schools.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">20</a> Although <em>Locke </em>states that there is some “play in the joints” between what is permitted by the Establishment Clause and what is required by the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution, <em>Locke, </em><a href="/us/540/0712-01" class="citation" data-index="284" data-cite="540 U.S. 712" data-case-ids="8897994" data-case-paths="/us/540/0712-01">540 U.S. at 718-19</a>, <a href="/us/540/0712-01" class="citation" data-index="285" data-cite="540 U.S. 712" data-case-ids="8897994" data-case-paths="/us/540/0712-01">124 S.Ct. 1307</a>, the overt and broad discrimination in education mandated by section 2951(2) goes far beyond the limited restriction on funding for ministry training sanctioned by the Supreme Court in <em>Locke, </em>and constitutes more “play in the joints” than was recognized as legitimate in <em>Locke. </em>The prohibition on payment of tuition for sectarian secondary schools is not required by the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, and <em>Locke </em>should not be read as providing authority for the discriminatory language found in section 2951(2).</p>

The enactment of section 2951(2) was based solely on the conclusion that it was necessary to ensure compliance with the Establishment Clause. That was the <em>only </em>reason advanced by the State in <em>Bagley </em>to justify the discrimination in section 2951(2). <em>Bagley, </em><a href="/a2d/728/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="289" data-cite="1999 ME 60" data-case-ids="11618134" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0127-01">1999 ME 60</a>, ¶ 56, <a href="/a2d/728/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="290" data-cite="1999 ME 60" data-case-ids="11618134" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0127-01">728 A.2d at 144</a>.

If it does provide such aid, however, it should not be able to exclude private schools that also happen to have a religious affiliation.
