The sole issue in this case is whether the police officer had a reasonable belief that Stahr was operating his vehicle in violation of Section 3802 of the Vehicle Code, <em>as amended, </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3802 (relating to driving under the influence of alcohol), in order to request a <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>chemical test. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the trial court’s decision and reinstate Stahr’s operating privileges.</p>

The record indicates that the accident took place in a rural area with no street lights; and Stahr claims the accident occurred when he tried to avoid hitting a deer. He was unable to remove his car from the guardrail, and was picked up by passing motorists who dropped him off at his house.</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[119,1043,751,495]]]'>Thereafter, a Pennsylvania State Police trooper (state trooper) came across the unoccupied vehicle, traced the license plate, and went to Stahr’s house. The state trooper took Stahr back to the accident scene. Stahr claims he had consumed alcohol when he returned home after the accident, and that he informed the state trooper accordingly before being returned to the accident scene.</p>

Brown (Officer Brown) had been called to the accident scene and arrived after Stahr had been brought back by the state trooper. The state trooper informed Officer Brown that Stahr was not on the scene when the state police arrived, and that the trooper located Stahr at his home using vehicle registration information. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 16A. When Officer Brown questioned Stahr about the accident, Stahr admitted that he had been driving the car. At this point, Officer Brown smelled alcohol and noticed that Stahr’s gait was unsteady and his speech slurred. Stahr also admitted to Officer Brown that he had been drinking, although Officer Brown testified that Stahr did not inform him that Stahr’s drinking took place at home after the accident. Officer Brown further testified that there was nothing about the accident itself that suggested the accident involved driving under the influence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Officer Brown presented Stahr with a form explaining the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical test and further advised Stahr regarding the same. Stahr refused to submit to testing, and signed the form acknowledging that he was knowingly and intelligently refusing to be tested. Notably, Stahr was never formally charged with driving under the influence.</p>

Reasonable grounds exist when a person in the position of the police officer, viewing the facts and circumstances as they appeared at the time, could have concluded that the motorist was operating the vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. In determining whether an officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a motorist was in ‘actual physical control’ of a vehicle, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the location of the vehicle, whether the engine was running and whether there was other evidence indicating that the motorist had driven the vehicle at some point prior to the arrival of the police. Whether reasonable grounds exist is a question of law reviewable by the court on a case by case basis.</blockquote>

In other cases where the Court found a police officer had or did not have reasonable suspicion of DUI, where the arrestee was not found in his car, a timeframe between the arrestee’s operation of the car and subsequent arrest, or some other evidence, such as witness accounts of the DUI, were established in the record. <em>See Hasson v.

We cannot, therefore, conclude that Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion that Stahr was in control of his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
