Boudwin described a planned meeting with Borzelleea on June 26, 2003 at Barnaby’s, a restaurant located in Havertown, Delaware County. Boudwin told Roberts that Borzelleea owned a Subaru automobile and Boud-win anticipated that Borzelleea would travel in this car from his Montgomery County residence to the meeting at Barnaby’s on June 26, 2003. Detective Roberts confirmed that a 2002 Subaru automobile was owned by Borzelleea and was registered to him at his Montgomery County address.

At 4:00 PM, Borzelleea called Newell to arrange the sale of two ounces of cocaine to Newell for $1900. Borzelleea told Newell that he and Mike wanted to meet at Barnaby’s to make the sale. At 4:30, Mike called Newell to ask him to ‘front’ the money. Newell was to ride with the Defendants back to Montgomery County.</blockquote>

Newell contends that Fithian gave Bor-zelleca three bags of cocaine, and that Borzelleca handed two bags of cocaine to Newell.

Nolan was first arrested in Lackawanna County and charged with various crimes relating solely to crimes that took place in Lackawanna County. Subsequently, Nolan was arrested and charged with crimes that took place solely within Luzerne County. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Nolan pled guilty in Lackawanna County to nine counts of receiving stolen property and one count of theft. From the transcript of the plea hearing, it was evident that there had been coordination between the prosecutors from the two counties. The Lackawanna County proceeding resulted in an aggregate sentence of 30 to 60 years’ imprisonment, based partly on the court’s labeling Nolan as a “career criminal.” In the Luzerne County case, Nolan, who had initially signed a guilty plea, revoked the plea and requested a jury trial. His counsel also moved to have all charges dismissed based upon double jeopardy grounds and on the compulsory joinder rule. In response, the trial court dismissed all charges that overlapped with the Lackawanna County prosecution, but after the jury trial was held on the remaining charges, Nolan was found guilty of six counts of theft by unlawful taking and five counts of receiving stolen property.

In fact, Nolan’s PCRA proceedings, including this Court’s review, were finalized prior to the enactment of the amendment.

The meeting at Barnaby’s in Havertown between Detective Newell and the Defendants] is the only activity that occurred exclusively within Delaware County. The phone calls between officers and Borzelleea and Fithian clearly occurred when the two Defendants were at locations in Montgomery County. Further, there was no evidence submitted to the Court that Detective Newell’s phone calls originated in Delaware County. Prior to the meeting, Borzelle-ca and Fithian spoke to one another and met in Montgomery County and discussed the plans to buy cocaine. Detective Newell requested the Defendants to come to Delaware County even though they told him that the supplier of the cocaine was in Montgomery County and they needed to go to his [the supplier’s] location to pick it up. The evidence, although subject to other interpretations, suggests that Newell sought to bring the Defendants to Delaware County to form a basis for a prosecution in that County. Barnaby’s is located a short distance from an exit on Route 476, a highway that is easily accessible in Montgomery County.</blockquote>

Fithian left his vehicle at Barnaby’s and rode with Borzelleea. Newell followed them to a bar in Montgomery County to allow the Defendants an opportunity to secure money for the cocaine purchase. Defendants told Newell that the supplier was located in Montgomery County.

The majority of the activity occurred in Montgomery County as set forth <em>swpra. </em>The conduct that occurred in both counties was part of the same criminal episode and formed a single transaction among the participants. Montgomery County gained jurisdiction over the conspiracy to purchase the two ounces of cocaine to deliver to Detective Newell when the Defendants agreed while in Montgomery County to sell to Newell and thereafter committed the overt acts, described above, in pursuance of that agreement in Montgomery County. The law is well settled that a prosecution for criminal conspiracy may be brought in the county where the unlawful combination or confederation was <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>formed, or in any county where an overt act was committed by any of the conspirators in furtherance of the unlawful combination or confederation. <em>Com. v.

Therefore, the conspiracy to sell two ounces of cocaine to Newell “occurred within the same judicial district as the former prosecution ...” and there was no information presented to this Court that the Court in Montgomery County had ordered a separate trial of this offense. Montgomery County officials elected to prosecute for the one ounce of cocaine seized in [the] traffic stop on Route 476. They either expressly or tacitly agreed to allow Delaware County [to] prosecute the balance of the Defendants’ criminality. This arrangement is prohibited by § 110.</blockquote>

The facts reveal that the only event that occurred in Delaware County was the meeting at Barnaby’s. As noted by the trial court, “[i]t is well settled that prosecution for criminal conspiracy may be brought in the county where the unlawful combination was formed, or in any county where an overt act was committed by any of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.” <em>Moyers, </em><a href="/pa-super/391/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="391 Pa.

Thus, even if we were to conclude that the unlawful combination was formed at the meeting at Barnaby’s in Delaware County, overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were committed in Montgomery County, establishing jurisdiction in Montgomery County to prosecute both defendants on all charges. The trial court’s discussion on the subject is quite telling and reinforces this Court’s position that a single prosecution in Montgomery County was the proper method to deal with the crimes committed by both Bor-zelleca and Fithian. The trial court further stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b287-8" data-blocks='[["BL_287.7",287,[983,541,716,1867]]]'>The Delaware County connection to the crime is the meeting that took place at Barnaby’s between Defendant’s [sic] and Detective Newell. There is no evidence in the record that the phone calls to or from Detective Newell occurred in Delaware County. The record establishes that the Defendants in Montgomery County received phone calls from New-ell. The Defendants met with each other in Montgomery County to carry out the plan to purchase cocaine. After meeting at Barnaby’s, the Defendants told Newell that they needed to drive to Montgomery County to complete the purchase. They stopped in Montgomery County to secure money to make the purchase and then drove to Philadelphia County to complete the transaction. The money and cocaine were not exchanged in Delaware County. Detectives from both counties were involved in the investigation and cooperated with one another. Both counties knew that the purchase of cocaine occurred in Philadelphia County and the Montgomery County detectives knew that Defendants arranged the sale to Newell. The evidence suggests that Montgomery County chose to arrest the Defendants in Montgomery [County] for the cocaine in their possession and allowed the Delaware County authorities to prosecute the conspiracy to sell to Newell as the investigation originated with Delaware County authorities.</blockquote>

Most importantly, there is an absence of any reason why the prosecution in Montgomery County could not have consolidated all charges against Borzelleca and Fithian. As hinted-to by the trial court, it appears that at least an implicit agreement between the counties was reached, possibly at the outset. Moreover, the evidence needed to convict the defendants would not have been different for each trial, and the one ounce of cocaine versus the two ounces of cocaine would not have confused the issues. In fact, both the one ounce and two ounce amounts were purchased at the same time and were discussed as a part of the conspiracy. The separate sale of the two ounces to Newell, which Delaware County claims is the basis for its proceeding, and the intended sale to a third party, which was the basis for the Montgomery County charges, are an insufficient reason to have two separate trials in two separate counties. The crimes committed were all part of the same criminal episode, which mainly took place in Montgomery County, and could have all been prosecuted in Montgomery County.</p>

That distinction rests concretely on the apparent and real distinction between what constitutes a “single criminal episode.” In <em>Nolan </em>the facts revealed that no single criminal episode occurred, while here the opposite was acknowledged by the Commonwealth. This materially distinguishes the facts of the two cases. Moreover, merely because a meeting took place at Barnaby’s rather than at a bar down the street, the two-fold purpose of the compulsory joinder rule, <em>i.e., </em>to protect a defendant from government harassment and to assure finality without unduly burdening the judicial process, would be contravened. <em>See Schmidt, </em><a href="/a2d/919/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="919 A.2d 241" data-case-ids="8325446" data-case-paths="/a2d/919/0241-01">919 A.2d at 245</a>.
