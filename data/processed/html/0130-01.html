The President of plaintiff suggested to defendant that this practice was not correct, and in the Bank’s Federal tax return for the fiscal year 1962 defendant changed the practice in a manner which eliminated the six-month lag. At the time the change was made defendant failed to obtain the consent for such change from the Secretary of the Treasury, or his delegate, as required by Section 446(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

The document put plaintiff on notice of an alleged tax deficiency which resulted from defendant’s failure to obtain the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Through the notice plaintiff, for- the first time, became aware of defendant’s failure to secure the necessary consent.

At that time plaintiff was given a period of ninety (90) days to file a petition with the Tax Court before action would be taken to collect the assessment. Plaintiff settled the claim in March, 1970, and this action was filed on September 28, 1971.</p>

    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[188,715,751,175]]]'>The sole question in this appeal is when the three-year period commenced to run, that is, when the cause of action “accrued”.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[182,952,755,665]]]'>The general law in this State is that the statute of limitations here involved begins to run at the time of the wrongful act, and, ignorance of a cause of action, absent concealment or fraud, does not stop it. The leading Delaware case on this point is Mastellone v. Argo Oil Corp., Del.Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%20379" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="82 A.2d 379">82 A.2d 379</a> (1950). In that case, plaintiff’s stock certificates were wrongfully but non-fraudulently converted on defendant’s books. Plaintiff did not know about this conversion until after three years had passed. In holding the statute applicable, the Court stated:</p>

Some principles of fairness appear at first view to commend that argument, but precedent saves us from a serious problem. It is well established in common law jurisdictions generally that ignorance of the facts is in the ordinary case no obstacle to the operation of a statute of limitations. There are, of course, certain well defined exceptions, such as infancy, incapacity, certain types of fraud, or concealment of the facts which would have disclosed the tort; but plaintiff has not pointed to any authority, and we have found none, indicating that this case falls within any of the known exceptions to the rule. . . .”</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b170-10" data-blocks='[["BL_170.10",170,[1028,853,712,278]]]'>“ . . . Furthermore, the fact that the individual plaintiff was unaware of the mistake in question at the time it was made does not, under the circumstances of record, stand in the way of the running of the statute”.</blockquote>
    <p id="b170-12" data-blocks='[["BL_170.11",170,[990,1166,747,377]]]'>And in Leibowitz v.

    <p id="b170-13" data-blocks='[["BL_170.12",170,[986,1581,749,422]]]'>In so holding the Court of Chancery relied on the general rule announced in Mas-tellone and followed in Artesian Water, Leibowitz and other cases that an action sounding in tort accrues at the time when the tort is committed, that the statute of limitations begins to run at that time, and that ignorance of the tort does not toll the operation of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b170-14" data-blocks='[["BL_170.13",170,[984,2043,748,372]]]'>We agree with that general rule, but, as the Court stated in Mastellone, there are exceptions, and certain well defined ones were stated. That list of exceptions, however, is not exhaustive. A recent decision by this Court in a medical malpractice case provides a guide for defining another exception.</p>
    <p id="b170-15" data-blocks='[["BL_170.14",170,[982,2469,748,233]],["BL_171.1",171,[200,243,750,270]]]'>In Layton v.

The Court considered the ef-<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>feet of a different limitation statute, 10 Del.C. § 8118, (which refers to the time when “injuries were sustained”) and concluded that an injury was sustained when its effects were felt or produced.

    <blockquote id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[234,558,714,858]]]'>“Upon the bases of reason and justice, we hold that when an inherently unknowable injury, such as is here involved, has been suffered by one blamelessly ignorant of the act or omission and injury complained of, and the harmful effect thereof develops gradually over a period of time, the injury is “sustained” under § 8118 when the harmful effect first manifests itself and becomes physically ascertainable. Translated in the terms of this case, we hold that the limitations period commenced to run when the plaintiff first experienced pain caused by the unknown foreign object. Since that event occurred in 1965 and this action was filed in 1966, the action is timely”.</blockquote>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[192,1484,753,668]]]'>In our view, the facts of this case are so analogous to <em>Layton </em>that we follow its rationale. As in <em>Layton </em>plaintiff’s ignorance of defendant’s failure to obtain permission of the Secretary of the Treasury was “inherently unknowable”, until such time as it was put on notice of a deficiency by the IRS letter of November 14, 1967. Implicitly the relationship was one of confidence and reliance by plaintiff on the expertise of defendant, not only in the field of general accounting, but also as to tax problems involved. As the Court below stated in its unreported opinion: ■ .</p>

This approach has obvious application to a taxpayer who does not know he has suffered a loss until the taxing authority asserts a claim. In such a triangular situation it would clearly work an injustice to expect Artisans’ to anticipate, or even be aware of, a possible injury. This is, in effect, merely a refinement of the so-called rule of discovery and is particularly appropriate here because the discovery in this situation does not arise in a client-accountant relationship but in the client-taxing authority relationship.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b171-8" data-blocks='[["BL_171.8",171,[997,753,755,666]]]'>California applies to a malpractice action against an accountant a “time of discovery” rule similar to the rule followed in a medical malpractice action.

App. 2d 361" data-case-ids="2198966" data-case-paths="/cal-app-2d/256/0361-01">256 Cal.App.2d 361</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2055" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="64 Cal. Rptr. 55">64 Cal.Rptr. 55</a> (Ct.App.1st Dist., 1967). There in May, 1963 a C.P.A. sued his client for a fee; the client counterclaimed alleging that as a result of a negligently prepared tax return in 1956, he was assessed some $19,000, by the IRS. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim on the basis of the statute of limitations, but the Court of Appeals reversed and adopted the “discovery rule”.</p>

The Court reasoned that the special obligation of a professional is exemplified by a duty not merely to perform work with ordinary care but to use the skill, prudence and diligence commonly exercised by practitioners of the profession. In addition, of course, is the inability of a layman to detect a professional’s negligence.</p>

The Court stated that in the relationship of accountant and client the trust and confidence that client places in the professional person places him in a vulnerable position should that trust and confidence be misplaced. Further the Court indicated that it is the policy of the law to encourage such trust and confidence, and likewise it is the duty of the law to protect the client from the negligent acts of the professional person.
