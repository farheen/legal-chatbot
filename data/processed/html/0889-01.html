Preferably, the secondary reflector is formed on a portion of an incandescent bulb of spherical contour.</p>

It resides in the transmission of the highest possible amount of light rays from a minimum candlepower source of illumination, avoiding the projecting of hazardous heat rays. It further resides in focusing light in a highly compact device — that is, where the light-source condensing lens and film are in very close proximity — with the minimum aberration.</blockquote>
