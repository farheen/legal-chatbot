Therefore, DOES denied the appeal as untimely, noting specifically that petitioner had failed to address the reason for the untimeliness of the appeal, that the record reflected proper certification that the decision was mailed to her on June 17, 1988, and that petitioner filed the appeal in person on July 5, 1988.</p>
