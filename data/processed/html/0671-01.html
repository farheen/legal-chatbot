White Deer Township filed a complaint for declaratory judgment challenging the validity of an ordinance providing health insurance to retired township supervisors and their families that was enacted by supervisors just before they retired. Charles Napp, Helen Napp, Leonard Car-is, Doris Caris, Charlotte Hartranft and Donald Bird (collectively Retirees) responded with preliminary objections that were sustained by the Court of Common Pleas of the 17th Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Union County Branch (trial court). This Court reversed and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to enter judgment in favor of White Deer Township.

However, the Supreme Court observed that Section 606 is “designed to curtail decision making by local supervisors on matters affecting their own self-interest” and, further, that “the legislative intent to limit self-interested decision making by supervisors is, again, manifest.” <em>White Deer Township, </em><a href="/pa/590/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="590 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="3852022" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0300-01">590 Pa. at 306</a>, <a href="/pa/590/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="912 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="3852022,8444034" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0300-01,/a2d/912/0781-01">912 A.2d at 785</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a>

The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in concluding that Section 606(c) authorized supervisors to confer post-retirement medical insurance benefits upon themselves. Further, because Section 606(c) pertains to what supervisors may receive while in office or while in the employ of the Township, the Supreme Court noted that “Section 606(c) does not <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>operate to control the conferral of post-retirement medical insurance benefits ....” <em>Id. </em>at 307, <a href="/pa/590/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="912 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="3852022,8444034" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0300-01,/a2d/912/0781-01">912 A.2d at 785</a>.</p>
