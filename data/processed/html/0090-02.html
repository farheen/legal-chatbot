After stating that the outcome of the case turned on the issue of adverse possession, the court indicated that “either a whole parcel adverse possession claim or a prescriptive easement claim would lie here.” The requirements for establishing an easement by prescription are similar to the requirements for acquiring title by adverse possession, with the additional element of acquiescence to the use by the record owner. <em>Baptist Youth Camp v. Robinson, </em><a href="/a2d/714/0809-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="1998 ME 175" data-case-ids="11716497" data-case-paths="/a2d/714/0809-01">1998 ME 175</a>, ¶ 14, <a href="/a2d/714/0809-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="1998 ME 175" data-case-ids="11716497" data-case-paths="/a2d/714/0809-01">714 A.2d 809</a>, 814. There is no evidence of acquiescence to the Loavenbrueks use by Rohrbach or his predecessors on this record. More importantly, the primary issue in this case, whether the Loavenbrueks can include within then-possessory period the time during which the Town of Rockland owned the land, is disposi-tive of both issues, adverse possession, and easement by prescription.</p>

Our holding in <em>Cary, </em>that the period during which a sovereign held record title cannot be counted in the prescriptive period against a subsequent grantee, is consistent with the principle adopted by the majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue. <em>See e.g. Pines, Inc. v. Bossingham, </em><a href="/idaho/131/0714-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="131 Idaho 714" data-case-ids="1601658" data-case-paths="/idaho/131/0714-01">131 Idaho 714</a>, <a href="/idaho/131/0714-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="131 Idaho 714" data-case-ids="1601658" data-case-paths="/idaho/131/0714-01">963 P.2d 397</a>, 400 (Ct.App.1998) (holding that a plaintiff could not include the time of a state’s ownership in its calculation of the prescriptive period); <em>Herbertson v.

Courts have also held that where land was previously owned by the government and is currently held by a private individual and a claimant adversely occupied the land during the entire time, the period of adverse possession against the government is not counted in determining the validity of the claim.”) (footnotes omitted). A large number of jurisdictions have adopted this principle in the context of tax liens. <em>See </em>J.H. Crabb, <em>Tax Sales or Forfeitures by or to Governmental Units as Interrupting Adverse Possession, </em><a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.L.R.%202d%20600" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="50 A.L.R. 2d 600">50 A.L.R.2d 600</a>, 604-06 (1956 &amp; Supp.1999) (majority view is that when a governmental entity obtains title to tax-forfeited lands the statute of limitations for claims related to real property is tolled until title is conveyed again by the government). For example, the court in <em>Fred E. Young, Inc. v. Brush Mountain Sportsmen's Association, </em><a href="/a2d/697/0984-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="697 A.2d 984" data-case-ids="12021389" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/0984-01">697 A.2d 984</a>, 992 (Pa.Super.1997), explained that</p>

Appellant therefore cannot rely upon the activities of the [adverse possessors] or their lessees during the period in which it was owned by the county <em>... to </em>establish adverse possession....

The Loavenbrucks, unpersuasively, attempt to distinguish <em>Cary </em>by arguing that disseizin requires both dispossession of the record owner plus an intent to oust the owner, and that they only dispossessed the Town. Thus, they claim that they can include within their prescriptive period the time during which the <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Town had record title because they did not effectuate a disseizin of a governmental agency, which is all that is prohibited by <em>Cary. </em>If the Loavenbrucks and their predecessors did not intend to oust the Town, then they have not satisfied the requirement that a disseisor must occupy the land “under a claim of right.” <em>See Striefel, </em>¶ 14, <a href="/a2d/733/0984-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="1999 ME 111" data-case-ids="11550456" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/0984-01">733 A.2d at 991</a> (party claiming title through adverse possession must prove that the use of the property was "under a claim of right” which means that "the claimant ‘is in possession as owner, <em>with intent to claim the land as [its] own, </em>and not in recognition of or subordination to [the] record title owner' ”) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 248 (6th ed.1990)) (emphasis added).</p>
