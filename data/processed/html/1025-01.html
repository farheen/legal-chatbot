According to the Commonwealth, Norris engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with one of his 14-year-old female students from March through June of 2007. Norris and the student engaged in sex on three occasions during this period, and Norris also allegedly supplied marijuana and cocaine to the girl. During the police investigation of Norris, a search warrant of his residence was conducted on February 9, 2009.

      <em>Miller </em>is an 83-year-old decision that, upon our reading, bears little relevance to the instant situation. <em>Miller </em>involved a Pennsylvania State Trooper who improperly withdrew charges against an individual accused of driving under the influence of alcohol, and then released the violator. The court examined the question as to whether the trooper could be considered a public officer liable to prosecution and conviction for the crime of malfeasance in office, or whether the trooper was a mere employee. Ultimately, the court found that because the trooper was invested with some of the powers and functions of the government, and was not merely clerical or an agent or a servant, the trooper did qualify as a public officer. Aside from the fact that it is not interpreting the present statute, <em>Miller </em>is inapposite because it involved the interpretation of who qualifies as a public officer or official as opposed to a mere employee. The instant statute, however, by its plain wording, is not aimed at just public officials, as the trial court suggests, but also at public employees. Thus, <em>Miller </em>fails to address our situation.</p>
    <p id="b1066-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1066.13",1066,[1000,2146,751,193]],["BL_1067.1",1067,[165,286,752,909]]]'>
      <em>Reese </em>is similarly inapposite. There, our supreme court determined whether public defenders were public officials so as to be immune from law suit for negligent <a id="p1029" href="#p1029" data-label="1029" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1029</a>misrepresentation. The court held that public defenders were not public officials because they do not serve as public administrators with policy-making functions, nor do their powers include any governmental functions. Again, <em>Reese </em>was not examining the present statute, but an immunity doctrine that applies only to public officials. The focus of the inquiry, as in <em>Miller, </em>is what defines a public official as opposed to a mere employee. However, unlike the immunity doctrine, the present statute applies to both public officials and public employees. It is wholly irrelevant to the statute at issue that a public employee may not qualify as a public official. Both are subject to the extended statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b1067-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1067.4",1067,[161,1229,753,966]]]'>Finally, the trial court observes, without recitation to authority, that it has examined other cases in which the statute of limitations was extended by this statute, and that all involved a defendant who was an elected or politically appointed official. This does not support a conclusion that the statute at issue applies only to public officials; rather, it only indicates that so far, only public officials have been prosecuted under the extended statute of limitations. This is unsurprising. Although in the ensuing analysis we find that power and authority are not a necessary aspect of employment to qualify for application of the extended statute of limitations, clearly employment that comes with power and authority will give far greater opportunities for abuse of the position.</p>
    <p id="b1067-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1067.5",1067,[159,2219,752,297]]]'>Since an analysis of case law provides no insight into whether a public schoolteacher is included in the definition of “public employee” as that term is used in section 5552(c)(2), we must, therefore, turn to our rules of statutory construction.</p>

    <p id="b1067-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1067.10",1067,[960,905,752,1280]]]'>Clearly, a public servant is any person who works for, and is paid by, any governmental unit, including the state, the counties, cities, townships, and boroughs, as well as school districts and municipal authorities. Under this definition, public schoolteachers are certainly public servants because they work for, and are paid by, a government unit (the school district) to perform a governmental function (education). We find that “public servant” is synonymous with “public employee.” A public employee is simply any person who works for, and is paid by, a governmental unit. We perceive no ambiguity whatsoever in that meaning. Public schoolteachers are public employees. The question thus remains that even if public schoolteachers are public employees within the meaning of Section 5552(c)(2), did the Legislature intend to limit the ambit of “public employee” as the trial court ruled, to public employees holding positions of power or authority. Nowhere in the plain words of the statute can we discern such an intent.</p>

This is precisely where the trial court <a id="p1030" href="#p1030" data-label="1030" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1030</a>erred. In a statute that simply extends the statute of limitations for all public employees, the trial court analyzed what the spirit of the law is in order to construe the meaning of “public employee,” a term we have found has a plain and obvious meaning, and is clear and free of any ambiguity. Thereafter, the trial court found that in extending the statute of limitations for public employees, the Legislature actually intended to limit the extension to public employees who wield some power or authority. In doing so, not only has the court improperly analyzed the spirit of the law where the words are clear and free of ambiguity, it has also effectively written “public employee” out of the statute, and enforced the statute only as to “public officials.” Thus, the trial court also violates the rule of statutory construction that directs that we give effect to <em>all </em>of the provisions of a statute. <em>See </em>1 Pa.

The trial court apparently believed that only an employee in a position of power or authority could abuse his or her public employment, and discounted the possibility that a mere janitor could similarly abuse his or her employment. Certainly, a public employee in a position of power or authority has more opportunity to abuse his or her employment. Yet, we can easily imagine a scenario where even a janitor might abuse his position. For instance, a publicly employed janitor may have access to the private offices of powerful public officials. Suppose the janitor were to steal bid information on a public project and then were to sell the information to a construction company? The janitor would have abused his public employment for personal gain and would be subjected to an extended statute of limitations.

In order to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this Commonwealth in their government, the Legislature further declares that the people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of holders of or nominees or candidates for public office do not conflict with the public trust. Because public confidence in government can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impar<a id="p1032" href="#p1032" data-label="1032" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1032</a>tiality and honesty of public officials, this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote complete financial disclosure as specified in this chapter. Furthermore, it is recognized that clear guidelines are needed in order to guide public officials and employees in their actions. Thus, the General Assembly by this chapter intends to define as clearly as possible those areas which represent conflict with the public trust.</blockquote>

    <p id="b1070-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.5",1070,[202,991,751,1432]]]'>The distinct purpose of the Ethics Act was to regulate public office holders and those seeking public office, and prohibit them from using that office to benefit financially at the expense of the public. Thus, the definition of public employee as used in the Ethics Act was specifically crafted to exclude from the definition of public employee anyone other than someone who essentially acts in the capacity of a public office holder. Unlike the Ethics Act, the statute extending the statute of limitations for public officials and public employees does not purport to apply to public office holders (or those acting in that capacity) alone, but to all public officials and all public employees. Thus, the specialized definition of public employee used in the Ethics Act does not address or affect the broader reach of the statute at issue, and therefore, does not conflict with a definition of public employee that does address the broader reach. In sum, we find that the limited definition of public employee contained in the Ethics Act was intended to apply to the Ethics Act only and was not intended to alter the definitions of other statutes.</p>

We find that Section 1102 of the Ethics Act does shed light on whether public employee, as used in the statute under review, includes public schoolteachers. At point, that the Legislature chose to specifically exclude public schoolteachers from the meaning of “public employee” shows that the Legislature was of the opinion that public schoolteachers would otherwise ordinarily be included in the meaning of “public employee.”</p>
    <p id="b1070-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.8",1070,[1000,743,752,1026]]]'>To summarize, our review of 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 5552(c)(2), leads us to conclude that in its plain meaning, “public employee” is any person who works for, and is paid by, a governmental unit. This is the meaning we must attach to the use in Section 5552(c)(2). A public schoolteacher works for, and is paid by, a local school district, which is a governmental body. Therefore, a public schoolteacher is a public employee within the meaning of Section 5552(c)(2). There is no vagueness or ambiguity in this regard. Furthermore, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to limit Section 5552(c)(2) to only those public employees who hold positions of power or authority. Therefore, we find that the statute applies to extend the statute of limitations for all public employees, including public schoolteachers.</p>

During the hearing on this matter below, the Commonwealth contended that no precedent exists because the term "public employee” plainly includes a public schoolteacher. The Commonwealth drew the analogy that there are no cases declaring that water is wet, because that fact is obvious to all. (Notes of testimony, 11/24/09 at 27-28.) We agree. As our subsequent analysis will show, we find that a public schoolteacher is clearly a public employee within the common usage of the term.</p>
