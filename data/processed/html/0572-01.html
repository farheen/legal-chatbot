At issue is whether a defendant provides a “fair and just reason” to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing whenever he asserts his innocence. We hold such an assertion does not divest a judge of discretion to weigh its sincerity according to the totality of circumstances known to the judge, and to deny the motion where, as here, the motion is founded not upon a sincere assertion, but upon a desire to delay sentencing in one case in order to obtain a favorable sentence in another.</p>

At the first scheduled sentencing hearing of April 15, 2005, Appellant moved to continue sentencing approximately 30 to 45 days until after such time he was to enter a guilty plea and receive sentence in federal court. Continuing sentence in the present case would, Appellant explained, prevent this conviction from being factored into his federal prior record score and thus significantly reduce his federal sentence. The Commonwealth objected and the court expressed its concern with permitting what would be a six month lapse between plea and sentence in a case involving violence to victims. N.T. 4/15/05 at 5-7. The court also noted additional hardships a continuance would cause, including replacement of the prosecutor scheduled for maternity leave, and the administrative difficulties of <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>coordinating judicial personnel now that the judge had been reassigned to the civil program.

As of that date, Appellant had moved to withdraw his guilty plea as sentencing in his federal case was still pending. In support of Appellant’s motion, defense counsel now argued that Appellant’s guilty plea was involuntarily made, as it was induced by counsel’s erroneous “assumption” that Appellant would be sentenced in the federal system prior to being sentenced in the state case. N.T. 5.10/05 at 5. The court could, however, effectively eliminate the involuntariness of the plea by continuing sentencing in this case until after such time Appellant is sentenced in the federal case, counsel argued. N.T. at 5-7. If the court would do so, counsel noted that the only possible impediment to the plea would be an assertion of innocence, and he confided to the court “[it’s] a different situation, whether I would in fact support a motion to withdraw a guilty plea at that time may not be true.” N.T. at 7.</p>

N.T. at 8. Defense counsel countered that a plea predicated on inaccurate advice from counsel renders such plea involuntary and qualifies as a “fair and just reason” permitting presen-tence withdrawal of the plea. N.T. at 9. Appellant himself added he had always maintained his innocence to the most serious charges-three counts of burglary — to which, he believed, evidence would show his codefendants alone were guilty.

We noted that the basis for the appellant’s requested withdrawal was that he did not “want to plead guilty to nothing [he] didn’t do.” Accordingly, we found that appellant, by this assertion of innocence — so early in the proceedings — offered a “fair and just” reason for withdrawal of his plea. Moreover, on this record there is not even the slightest suggestion that the prosecution was in any sense “substantially prejudiced by reliance upon the defendant’s plea.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20268" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="299 A.2d 268">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/450/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="450 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="1947087" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0185-01">450 Pa. at 192</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20268" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="299 A.2d 268">299 A.2d at 272</a> (emphasis added).</blockquote>

See N.T. September 7, 1994 at 4. Moreover, the uncontroverted evidence of record fails to reveal that the Commonwealth would have suffered any prejudice, let alone substantial prejudice, had Appellant’s withdrawal request been permitted. Thus, based on our decision in <em>Forbes, </em>Appellant offered a fair and just reason for withdrawing his guilty pleas made prior to sentencing, and, accordingly, his request in this regard should have been permitted.</blockquote>

In contrast, Appellant’s conditional assertion of innocence — invoked at the prospect of being sentenced, withdrawn at the prospect of receiving yet another continuance — was anything but clear. Indeed, no sooner would the assertion be made than it would be completely contradicted by statements admitting guilt should sentencing be deferred until resolution of the federal case. Defense counsel himself conceded at the hearing of May 10, 2005 that he doubted his ability to represent Appellant on the assertion of innocence at a later date if the <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>court granted Appellant’s requested motion for continuance.</p>

Yet, it has also recognized there is no absolute right to a pre-sentence withdrawal of a plea, and has issued clear holdings that the denial of such a motion is proper where the evidence before the court belies the reason offered. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant argues beyond the scope of his "Statement of Question Presented” to address also whether his plea was the involuntary product of inaccurate representations made by plea counsel. While Appellant raised this reason for withdrawal at the May 10, 2005 hearing, the transcript does not clarify precisely what counsel said, or the level of certitude expressed, to Appellant in recommending a plea. It does appear that counsel never induced a plea through a promise that the federal case would precede the state case, and that Appellant’s own statements to the court revealed he possessed a fair degree of knowledge and sophistication in sentencing procedure at the outset of his plea considerations. Such indications militate strongly against a finding that ineffective assistance of counsel induced this plea. Nevertheless, we are constrained to find the record inadequate to dispose of this claim, and conclude that the better practice is to dismiss this claim without prejudice to Appellant to raise it in collateral proceedings, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth v.
