Appellant stopped her and inquired if she had received the message <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> he had left in her car the night before. Receiving an affirmative response, appellant said: <em>“I </em>just want you to know, I want you to understand that if you don’t <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>know it already, that I’m going to kill you, and don’t make any mistake about that.

The complainant testified that appellant had threatened her on several occasions during 1961 prior to the November 2 incident; In January he threw a rock through her window and said, “That is an indication of what I’m going to do to you if you don’t come back * * In March appellant grabbed her arm and said, “I am going to take care of you.” Her employer attempted to intervene, at which time appellant told the complainant, “I will take care of you but good, and don’t you make any mistake.” The testimony concerning this incident was corroborated by her employer. Later that month appellant made a similar threat. In June or July he brought a gun to her place of employment. Removing the bullets, he said to her, “You say, you want one of these?”</p>

But there are exceptions, and the evidence is admissible when the acts are so blended or connected with the one on trial that proof of one incidentally involves the other, or they explain the circumstances of the offense charged, or tend to logically prove any element of the offense.

    <p id="b429-10" data-blocks='[["BL_429.9",429,[946,812,751,1387]]]'>In the case before us, the testimony of prior threats was admitted by the trial court to show the state of mind of appellant and the complainant. We think that the court’s ruling as to its admissibility was correct. The prior threats, similar ,in nature to the offense charged, were directed to the complainant. As evidence of similar prior acts between the same parties, the testimony was relevant to the mental disposition of appellant at the time in issue. The evidence could properly be considered by the court for it indicated a disposition to commit the offense charged, the probabilities being that the emotional predisposition would continue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Where the prior acts were so similar to the acts charged and each occasion involved the same parties, the rationale of the exception is not limited to sexual offenses. The evidence of the prior threats was closely connected and substantially relevant to the offense charged,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and there is no indication that the mental disposition of appellant was brought to an end before the time in issue. We do not believe that by admitting the testimony into evidence the court confused the issues, nor was appellant unfairly surprised or unduly prejudiced.</p>
