There is no absolute, present gift of the <em>oorpus, </em>nor of the income, in such manner as to carry the <em>corpus </em>with it, for the income is to be applied to the maintenance and education of the family, and the surplus is bequeathed as the lands, negroes, etc., are. When, then, does the property for the first time vest? This is answered by the language of the will already quoted, which is equivalent to saying it shall first vest <em>when </em>my oldest son, or if my oldest son, attains the age of twenty-one years, and as further qualified by the terms of the third clause, which says it shall then be divided ‘ between my wife and such of my children <em>as may then be living, </em>each to have an equal share, and the child or children of any deceased child to represent and receive the share of such deceased child.’ The clause last quoted still stronger manifests the intention of the testator, that his oldest boy must arrive at twenty-one before his legacy became vested, because if not in life at that time, nor having a child or children surviving him, his share remained with the estate, and the younger children who then might not be in life, took no interest whatever in the share intended for the oldest. This intention of the testator is nearly everywhere <em>apparent </em>in his will. If we consider it settled that the oldest child must arrive at the age of twenty-one years before his legacy vests, then the question arises, is the legacy of the younger children subject to the same contingency? If the testator hah, in so many words, so declared, <em>that </em>must determine the question propounded affirmatively. I maintain that he has so said in the latter clause of the third item. This says that ‘after the oldest son’s share has been set apart to him, all the remainder of the shares, and the entire estate, not given over to such child <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>then arrived at the full age, to be kept together <em>for the benefit of my wife and the minor children, </em>a <em>new </em>division to be made as each child shall arrive <em>at </em>the full age of twenty-one, as <em>herein-before stated’ </em>How, then, and on what terms was the division made in favor of the oldest child ? How is it ‘ hereinbefore stated?5 As before stated, the legacy of the oldest child was contingent upon his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, and upon the happening of that contingency, a division is to be made that he may receive that legacy. That is the manner of vesting and dividing 'hereinbefore stated,5 and which is made <em>applicable </em>to the legacies of the younger children. This will be made more apparent by an examination into the intention of the testator, to be drawn from the <em>whole </em>will.</blockquote>

That necessity was the arrival of a child at full age, when he, <em>by the law, </em>enters for the first time upon the business of life. If that necessity should never arrive, he desired <em>not </em>to give, and, therefore, <em>not </em>to divide his property, but to keep it together for the benefit of his wife and children, and thus keeping together to be disturbed only upon the happening of the contingency mentioned. If this was his motive— his purpose — it would destroy it completely to make the gift take effect in favor of a younger child if <em>not </em>in life at the time he <em>should be </em>twenty-one years of age, and thus compel a division, while it is made necessary that the oldest should arrive at full age. At the death of the <em>oldest, </em>only those of his <em>other </em>children were to share in the divisions (as qualified by the testator,) <em>'who might then be living,’ </em>while in the case of the younger, if, <em>as to them, </em>the legacies are to be treated as vested, the property <em>must </em>be divided at the time when each would arrive at twenty-one, even though then not in being, and the share of each would be withdrawn from the estate to go to the next of kin, whoever they might be, or to pass into stranger hands, perhaps, by the wills the legatees might make and leave. Such is not the ' manner5 in which the testator has disposed of his property, as defined by the terms ' hereinbefore stated.5 It is also palpable that the testator’s wife, as well as (if not more strongly than) <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>bis children, was the object of his solicitude. She is to derive all the benefit possible in the way of support from his plantation and negroes, so long as kept together, and upon every division she is to be counted as one of the legatees or distributees. To withdraw from the estate the portion of a child who had died before attaining majority, would be to deprive the widow of any possible future participation in the income of the property so drawn off, or any interest in the <em>corpus </em>at the final division. At the time of making testator’s will, at the time of his death, and now, the statutes of the State of Georgia provide that if a widow having children marries, and one of her children dies, leaving an estate, she has no distributive share unless the deceased is the 'last and only child.’</blockquote>

The simple use of such terms, if even hnexplained in the same connection, should not be so taken as to defeat a contrary general intent manifest throughout the will; but when, as here, they have a signification consistent with that interest, it is impossible to give them the effect claimed. All the children had an interest in the property to the extent of a support, and to a share therein, when they should arrive at full age. The possibility of dying before that age, is a remote contingency, and, therefore, there is nothing at variance with the view I take because the testator calls this very probable interest 'share.’ But it will be perceived that in the same connection he also <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>says, ‘all the remainders of the shares, and entire estate, not given over to such child then arrived at the full age, to be kept together <em>for the benefit of my wife and minor children.’ </em>The supposed or anticipated shares were to make testator’s‘entire estate,’ and to be used ‘for the benefit of his wife and minor children/ which benefit he elsewhere explains <em>‘as a joint support out of the income.’ </em>He also makes provision for the disposition of the ‘surplus’ arising from such ‘use and benefit.’</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b37-4" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[137,817,1157,1031]]]'>“Such a disposition of the property is utterly inconsistent with the <em>vesting </em>of the <em>corpus </em>of such property. It could not remain testator’s estate, in which the legatees had rights, only to the extent of a support, and yet be, in <em>them, </em>a vested interest. To create a vested interest, there must be a present gift of the <em>corpus, </em>or of the entire profits or income thereof, and otherwise unrestricted, so as to amount to a gift of the <em>corpus: Hanson vs. Graham, </em>6 <em>Vesey, page </em>239. In such cases the time of payment may be postponed and the gift become a vested interest; but it must be clear that the timéis annexed to. the payment and not to the gift. If to the gift, it is a contingent and not a vested interest. Judged by this rule, the time must be annexed to the gift, for there is no gift <em>until </em>each child shall arrive at twenty-one years or have issue then living, and because the whole disposition of the property establishes that the testator contemplated the possibility that the gifts might, in some of the children, fail to take effect, and made his bequest so as to meet such a contingency, and not in contemplation of the contrary. The dispositions of the will arc adequate to meet the former, but not the latter contingency.</blockquote>

Nevertheless, he has certainly disposed of his <em>whole </em>property by will, in so much that it isaZZ'to be ‘kept together’ from time to time, until the youngest child becomes of age.
