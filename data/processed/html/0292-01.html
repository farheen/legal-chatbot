Several police officers, including the arresting officer, interviewed a number of people regarding the shooting incident. Two people, who both witnessed the shooting, told police that they saw a Hispanic male fire shots on Franklin Street and then run to a nearby vehicle (one of the witnesses described it as a big red car) driven by another Hispanic male, which then sped away. A third eyewitness told police that he saw the shooter get out of a red Cadillac and the passenger slide over into the driver’s seat. The shooter walked onto Franklin Street and fired several shots at two individuals, then reentered the Cadillac which sped away.</p>

He further revealed that upon returning, the shooter told him that he had shot the victim. Abdellah also told police that he agreed to take the shooter to Philadelphia, and that they left appellant at the residence.</p>

The shooter advised Heyere that he and appellant had used the red Cadillac to go to and from the shooting and that he had shot a man on Franklin Street. Heyere also told police that appellant was called “Shorty”.</p>

Viewed objectively, this information connected him with the shooter in circumstances which made it probable that he was involved with the shooter and/or had acted in concert with him. The information provided by secondary witnesses was also reliable in that it was corroborated to a large degree by eyewitnesses (red Cadillac involved in shooting; two Hispanic males were involved — one was the shooter, the other was the driver), and one of the secondary witnesses proffered information which was adverse to his penal interest (Abdellah helped shooter flee to Philadelphia). Finally, appellant has failed to offer, nor are we aware, of any authority which prohibits the use of hearsay, especially in a case, such as this one, where the information was relayed through other police officers. Of necessity, a determination of probable cause, whether by magistrate or by a police officer, will in many cases require the <em>police to rely </em>on information learned from others. It is for this reason that the reliability of individuals providing information is examined. We remind appellant that the officer need only possess sufficient facts such that a person of reasonable caution would believe that a crime had been committed and that appellant was involved. In this case, the arrest of appellant was supported by an abundance of probable cause.</p>

The shooter walked a short distance down Franklin Street and fired several shots at two men. Meanwhile, appellant drove the Cadillac through the traffic light at Ninth and Franklin Streets. As the Cadillac proceeded through the intersection, the driver (appellant) was looking back out the window in the direction of the shooter, and the wheels of the Cadillac were scraping against the curb on the far side of the intersection.

The majority’s statement on page 13 of its Opinion that “the intent to kill must include the intent to do a lesser degree ... of damage” ignores the element of malice. When malice is accounted for, the equation looks much different: the intent to kill out of passion does not necessarily subsume the intent to do serious bodily injury out of cruelty or hardness of heart.</p>
