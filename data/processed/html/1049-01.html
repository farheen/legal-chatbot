It is stipulated that the Cato Institute is a satisfactory non-profit tenant under the regulation. Neither is it disputed that the residence at issue fits all but one of the other statutory requirements. However, the square foot area of the residence is far less than the 10,000 square feet which § 3101.412 requires. Intervenors, therefore, sought an area variance under the special use authorized by § 3101.412.</p>
    <p id="b1082-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1082.7",1082,[200,1716,747,369]]]'>The principal issue is whether the BZA was authorized in holding that the type of variance necessary for intervenors to take advantage of § 3101.412 was an area variance as held or a use variance as petitioner claims. Resolution of this issue is disposi-tive in light of the different burdens which must be met by an applicant for each.</p>
    <p id="b1082-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1082.8",1082,[203,2109,746,508]],["BL_1082.9",1082,[998,243,743,218]]]'>An applicant for an area variance need only show that the proposed use will be compatible with the Zoning Regulation, and that compliance with the area restriction would be unnecessarily burdensome. <em>See Palmer v. Board of Zoning Adjustment, </em><a href="/a2d/287/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="287 A.2d 535" data-case-ids="8068238" data-case-paths="/a2d/287/0535-01">287 A.2d 535</a>, 542 (D.C.1972). If appropriate, the BZA’s findings of fact fully support the granting of an area variance. On the other hand, an applicant for a use variance bears the heavy burden of showing that the property cannot be used for <em>any </em>purpose consistent with the zoning district. <em><a href="/a2d/287/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="287 A.2d 535" data-case-ids="8068238" data-case-paths="/a2d/287/0535-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/287/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="287 A.2d 535" data-case-ids="8068238" data-case-paths="/a2d/287/0535-01">at 542</a>. If we determined that intervenor had to justify a use variance, we would remand to the BZA.</p>
    <p id="b1082-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1082.10",1082,[997,500,745,596]]]'>We are not here presented with the usual area variance case in which the applicant seeks to avoid restrictions on rear yard size or frontage for an acceptable use. <em><a href="/a2d/287/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="287 A.2d 535" data-case-ids="8068238" data-case-paths="/a2d/287/0535-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/287/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="287 A.2d 535" data-case-ids="8068238" data-case-paths="/a2d/287/0535-01">at 541</a>. Nor are we faced with the typical use variance application which an individual would seek to permit a non-conforming use in a particular zoning district. Instead, in-tervenors request a variance which would permit a deviation from an area requirement under a regulation which authorizes a special use exception in certain circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b1082-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1082.11",1082,[996,1125,745,502]]]'>The BZA reasons that only an area variance was required because to do otherwise would frustrate the central intent and purpose of § 3101.412; that is, the efficient use of large and/or historic residential structures to avoid their deterioration into empty shells. The BZA concluded, therefore, that the 10,000 square foot minimum building size contained in § 3101.412 was arbitrary and not an essential part of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b1082-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1082.12",1082,[996,1656,746,698]]]'>Ultimately, we are persuaded by this analysis. If the central purpose of the regulation is to be fulfilled, flexibility as to the size of the eligible residences must be maintained. Rigorous adherence to the 10,000 square foot minimum could defeat the regulatory intent. Indeed, upon creation of this specially excepted use, it is not unreasonable to hold that applicants need only meet the lesser burden of proving an area variance to have use of § 3101.412. The BZA’s decision is supported by the facts and consistent with § 3101.412. <em>See Keefe Co. v.
