Appellant has achieved this new product by performing an old process on a starting material, or base metal alloy, not previously used in the process. The end-product is satisfactory, whereas prior end-products were not, due to spalling, because the old process has produced a novel article. That novelty is due to the characteristics of the starting material, not the process to which it was subjected. The selection of the starting material was, presumably, no obvious but such selection is not a category of patentable invention. 35 USO 100.

In a subsequent letter, the examiner referred to the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, 706.03 (q),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and a Commissioner’s Notice, entitled “Guidelines of Patentability,” 792 O.G. 293 GPI(e),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> urging that the “alleged novel starting material is obvious from an inspection of the claimed article.” Appellant’s brief to the board challenged the statutory foundation for such a rejection in the patent statutes. Only in a Supplemental Examiner’s Answer, in response to appellant’s Reply Brief, was the Henderson patent relied upon as <em>prior art </em>in discussing the appealed claims.
