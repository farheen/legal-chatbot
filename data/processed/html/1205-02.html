The trial court denied the motion. After trial, defense counsel moved for a new trial on <em>Batson </em>grounds in the interests of justice pursuant to Super.Ct.Crim.R. 33. Once again, the court denied the motion, concluding that the original <em>Batson </em>motion had not been timely filed. The trial court continued with the hearing, however, electing to decide — in the event it had erred on the timeliness issue— whether the prosecutor had offered sufficient race-neutral reasons to explain his peremptory challenges and thereby rebut what the court found to be a prima facie showing of racial discrimination. The court concluded that the prosecutor had not intentionally struck the jurors because of their race and, therefore, that appellant’s constitutional rights under <em>Batson </em>had not been violated. We review appeals from the judgment and from the denial of appellant’s motion for a new trial. We agree with appellant’s <em>Batson </em>claim, reverse, and remand for a new trial.</p>

The stabbing occurred after a fight between Latino and black men at a meal truck line in the Mount Pleasant area. The government’s primary witness was Thomas Guiles, a black man, who witnessed the stabbing. Guiles identified appellant two weeks later at another soup kitchen and called the police to arrest him.</p>

She described the assailant as a Latino man in his upper-thirties, who was heavy-set, several inches taller than she, with shoulder-length, straight black hair. She denied that appellant was the assailant. Susan Kranyik testified that she had seen the assailant from her fourth floor apartment window. Her description of the assailant was similar to the description Gottlieb gave. When asked whether appellant could have been the assailant, Kranyik responded, “[H]e doesn’t look at all like the person that I saw that did the stabbing.”</p>

Counsel asserted that the prosecutor “exercised every single one of his challenges to strike a non-black person from the jury with the possible exception of one person that he struck from the panel” and that this pattern was significant given the racially-charged nature of the case and the different races of the witnesses. The prosecutor responded that defense counsel’s contention was “outrageous” and that non-blacks remained on the jury. He commented that some of the police officers in the case were Hispanic and white and that defense counsel had “exercised her challenges to strike every black male but one on the jury panel.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The prosecutor then recounted why he had struck two potential jurors. He explained that one juror had expressed concern that the ten years she lived in South America might render her more sympathetic to a Hispanic defendant, and another juror had indicated that she spoke Spanish and might not follow the court interpreter’s translation if it interfered with her own understanding.</p>

Specifically, defense counsel noted that the prosecutor allegedly struck juror 862 because of her employment as a hospital worker, but he did not strike two black jurors who also worked in hospitals. Furthermore, the prosecutor allegedly struck jurors 950 and 986 because they had friends or relatives who were lawyers; however, a black juror, who also responded that she had a lawyer friend, remained on the panel. In addition, the prosecutor allegedly struck jurors 896, 950, and 975 because they were victims of violence. The prosecutor, however, did not strike two black jurors even though they also were victims of violence. Defense counsel summarized: “Obviously the difference[s] between people who made it onto the jury and the people that [the prosecutor] struck in each of these instances were people he struck were white, and the people that were on the jury were black.” She argued that if this trial had occurred in the South, and the races of the parties were reversed, a court would not accept the prosecutor’s explanations.</p>

The court recognized some of the practical difficulties in reconstructing the jury selection process. These difficulties are compounded when months pass between jury selection and the <em>Batson </em>hearing.

This court, as a result, reversed Turman’s conviction. Prosecutors in the District frequently practice before the same judge. Although it is perhaps unavoidable that a judge’s previous experience with a prosecutor will have some bearing on the judge’s assessment of the prosecutor’s credibility, the fact that the prosecutor has not been accused of diseriminatorily striking jurors in the past is not a part of the record and may not be considered in determining whether he or she is diseriminatorily striking jurors in the present.</p>

Rigorous scrutiny is essential because the “exclusion of even one black [or white] member of the venire for racial reasons violates” at least that prospective juror’s rights under the equal protection clause, <em>Little v.

The court focused exclusively on whether the prosecutor’s explanations about each rejected juror were logical and believa<a id="p1212" href="#p1212" data-label="1212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1212</a>ble rather than assessing each challenge in the entire context of the case and probing the prosecutor to determine why he had treated similarly situated black and white persons differently. The inherent logic and credibility of the prosecutor’s individual explanations as to each stricken venireperson are not sufficient, taken only by themselves, to rebut such a prima facie case of racial discrimination when prospective jurors of several races who appear to be similarly situated — based on their answers to questions during voir dire — are accepted or rejected for jury service by apparent reference to race. A more rigorous scrutiny by the trial court is essential, especially in light of the prosecutor’s elimination of all non-black venirepersons from the jury. The court’s statements that “having read [the prosecutor’s] conclusions, they sound perfectly logical to me,” <em>see supra </em>note 2, and “I don’t have any reason to disbelieve him,” show that the court did not engage in the “closest possible scrutiny” of the formidable statistical evidence of racial discrimination, as required by <em>Batson.

The prosecutor claimed, for example, that he had struck juror 862 — who was white — for her employment as a hospital worker, as well as for her reluctance to make eye contact with him. <em>See supra </em>note 2. The prosecutor, however, did not challenge jurors 893, 941, and 980 — three other female hospital workers who were black — even though juror 980 was a victim of several crimes and juror 941 explained that her brother had a pending drug prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b1284-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1284.7",1284,[1017,341,754,993]]]'>Next, the prosecutor noted that crime victims may have “impermissible biases” and struck three white jurors — 896, 950, 975— because either they or someone close to them had been a victim of crime. <em>See supra </em>note 2. The prosecutor, however, did not strike the three black jurors — 001, 968, 980 — who were victims of crime, even though their experiences had been just as serious, if not more so, than the white crime victims. In addition, the prosecutor struck two white jurors — 950, 986 — because they had friends or relatives who were lawyers, <em>see supra </em>note 2, but he did not strike a black juror — 980— who had a lawyer friend.

Here, the trial court could note that the prosecutor had been concerned that white juror 862’s employment at the National Rehabilitation Hospital would make her “more likely to base her judgment of the guilt or non guilt of the defendant on pure speculation and on sympathy rather than on the facts of the case.” But then the court should have asked the prosecutor why he had not been concerned enough about the predispositions of hospital employees to strike three black jurors who worked, respectively, at District of Columbia General Hospital (980), the Hospital for Sick Children (941), and Walter Reed Army Medical Center (893). The prosecutor could then respond — as he did — that the white juror also did not make eye contact with him. The trial court would then have to determine whether that difference highlighted by the prosecutor provided a sufficient, nondiscriminatory explanation, taking into account the strength of the prima facie showing of discrimination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> That kind <a id="p1213" href="#p1213" data-label="1213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1213</a>of analysis was not done here, and thus the prosecutor’s explanations ring hollow in light of the large number of whites struck. “In the problem of racial discrimination, statistics often tell much, and Courts listen.” <em>Harris v.

Because whites constituted twenty-six percent of the venire, one might have expected, statistically, that two or three of the prosecutor’s strikes would have been directed toward whites. Instead, nine were used to strike whites. As the actual number of strikes used against one race deviates further from the statistically expected result, a racial consideration — intentional or not — is more likely to be the true consideration behind the strikes. <em>See Ford v.

Although defense counsel asserted that the prosecutor had exercised nine of ten peremptory strikes against white jurors, the court could not verify her assertions in the record. The prosecutor only recalled that four of his peremptories had been used against whites. Because the government never objected to defense counsel’s assertion and did not supplement the record with evidence to the contrary, the court "operated under the assumption that [the government] used nine of ten strikes to exclude white people.”</p>

Instead, we emphasize that the trial court must scrutinize every reason given, some of which will appear less inherently plausible than others. For example, "explanations which focus upon a venireperson’s body language or demeanor must be closely scrutinized because they are subjective and can be easily used by a prosecutor as a pretext for excluding persons on the basis of race." <em>People v. Harris, </em><a href="/ill-2d/129/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="129 Ill. 2d 123" data-case-ids="5567019" data-case-paths="/ill-2d/129/0123-01">129 Ill.2d 123</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20Ill.%20Dec.%20861" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="135 Ill.

Explanations not rationally related to traits involved in one's service as a juror or "a generalized statement of reasons for peremptory strikes” are also suspect and require rigorous trial court scrutiny. <em>See Little, </em><a href="/a2d/613/0880-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="613 A.2d 880" data-case-ids="11742657" data-case-paths="/a2d/613/0880-01">613 A.2d at 886</a>. Finally, race is an impermissible factor, even if a minor one, in exercising peremptory strikes. It need not be "the <em>sole </em>reason for discrimination nor the total factor of discrimination" to be impermissible. <em>Smith v. Sol D. Adler Realty Co., </em><a href="/f2d/436/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="436 F.2d 344" data-case-ids="2213645" data-case-paths="/f2d/436/0344-01">436 F.2d 344</a>, 350 (7th Cir.1971).
