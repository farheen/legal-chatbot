The vehicle’s owner had testified that Maurice, accompanied only by a person other than the defendant, had borrowed the car some six to eight hours previously. Two items proved to have been stolen from the business establishment were found in the vehicle, namely, a package containing steaks in the unoccupied back seat and a “Butterball” turkey in the rear cargo area. The defendant denied having any knowledge relative to the acquisition of this meat, and there was no evidence to the contrary.</p>
