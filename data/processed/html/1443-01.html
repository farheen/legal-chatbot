Young, for example, discloses a process for preparing various indoles including, inter alia, 3-beta-aminobutyl-indole, another name for etryptamine. The indole compounds in general are said to be useful “as pharmaceutical products and also as intermediates in the manufacture of compounds of pharmacological utility, particularly of 5-hydroxytryptamine.” Snyder, on the other hand, discloses techniques for the preparation of various derivatives of tryptamine including, among other things, the acetate of etryptamine. The various derivatives of tryptamine disclosed by Snyder are said to be “of interest * * * because of the physiological activity of the parent base.”</p>

In the examiner’s view, Young and Snyder state that etryptamine is “useful as a pharmaceutical product” and that the acetates of etrypta-mine are of interest “because of their physiological activity.” Under those circumstances, it would be a routine matter, the examiner <a id="p1446" href="#p1446" data-label="1446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1446</a>thought, for one of ordinary skill in the art to prepare therapeutic compositions containing a pharmaceutical carrier and the racemic mixture of etryptamine or, in light of Karrer’s discussion of separating optical isomers of a racemic mixture, to isolate the individual isomers and prepare therapeutic compositions containing them.

The board refused to consider the affidavit because, in its view, appellant had neither proceeded in accordance with the governing Pules of Practice of the Patent Office nor timely filed that document. We agree with the board’s stated reasons for refusing to consider the affidavit, and appellant does not ask us to consider it in the first instance here.

It was in those circumstances the court held that the mere formulation of pharmaceutical compositions containing certain amounts of the active ingredients of the prior art and a pharmaceutical carrier would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>

Snyder’s disclosure that the “derivatives” of tryptamine are merely “of interest” because “of the physiological activity of the parent base” is not indication at all that etryp-tamine itself necessaarily <em>has </em>some nebulous “physiological activity” of the parent base (tryptamine) <em>in fact, </em>much less what specific activity that would be. Similarly, Young’s disclosure that many widely divergent indoles which can be prepared by his process are useful as “pharmaceutical products” is no clear suggestion that etryp-tamine itself necessarily has such utility, whatever that may be.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In our view, absent a disclosure by Young or Snyder of specific therapeutic or pharmaceutical uses for etryptamine, the addition of a pharmaceutical carrier to that compound and the determination of suitable unit dosage forms is not obvious. We do not think it is reasonable to assume, as the Patent Office seemingly has, that researchers would as a matter of course incorporate chemical compounds in specific amounts into pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and dosage unit forms unless they had some reasonably specific pharmaceutical use in mind. The recitation in the claims of certain amounts of active ingredient in combination with the carrier provides some further measure of distinction over the art, inasmuch as the references do not suggest the use of <em>any </em>particular amounts <a id="p1448" href="#p1448" data-label="1448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1448</a>of etryptamine.

As one reason, the board seemed to feel that the fact that appellant’s assignee had taken no action over a period of 4½ years to secure withdrawal of the FDA Suspension Order relating to its New Drug Application covering “Monase” (which it requested itself) had some bearing on the patentability of the present subject matter. If, as the board says, approval by the FDA is not a necessity to patenting of the new drug composition in the first place, of what material or relevant significance is that inaction unless, in final analysis, the board would indeed require commercial marketing, or at least approval therefor by the FDA, before  authorizing a patent to issue? But certainly “commercial usefulness,” i.e. progress in the development of a product to the extent that it is presently commercially salable in the market place, has never been a prerequisite for a reduction to practice and the subsequent patentability of any of the classes of patentable subject matter set forth in §101, much less the particular class of compositions of matter called drugs.

In contrast to the situation in <em>Brenner </em>v. Manson, where <em>no </em>specific <em>use </em>or useful property was disclosed for the claimed compounds, here a useful property of etryptamine has been discovered in animal tests, compositions containing it have been subjected to extensive clinical trials in humans, and those compositions have even been commercially marketed. The evidence of record incontrovertably establishes that appellant’s compositions are effective in treating various types of mental depressions in humans. And the Anglin affidavit is also sufficient to establish, we think, that the compositions have been, and can be, administered safely (though perhaps not with absolute safety) to human patients by qualified, knowledgeable medical experts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> The fact that compositions containing etryptamine, as demonstrated by the data in the second Anglin affidavit, have been administered to over 400,000 patients<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> with little or no reported or apparent serious ill effect in each, other than the 12 reported cases of agranulocytosis, is telling evidence of the practical safety and consequent usefulness of the compositions.

It is, as appellant points out, as if the Patent Office views the evidence of 12 possible cases of a serious side effect (a rate of 1 case for each 35,000 patients treated, an incidence of 0.003%) as “wiping out” the benefit to many which “Monase” has contributed. That incidence of side effect, in our opinion, does not lead to that result.</p>

Wholly aside from that contention, we think the board overlooked the fact that “Monase” had been withdrawn from the market in April 1962 or shortly thereafter, more than three years prior to the October 27, 1965 execution date of the second Anglin affidavit which reported the known incidence of agranulocytosis to that time as 12 cases. In neither of its decisions has the board questioned the completeness of the Anglin affidavit as of its execution date. Nor has it given us cause to think or assume that there may have been significantly — indeed, anymore cases of side effects than those Anglin reported in a product that had been removed from the <a id="p1461" href="#p1461" data-label="1461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1461</a>commercial market and unavailable for use since about April 1962 and particularly since October 1965, or to believe that appellant bas not carried out whatever responsibility<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> he may have in the present regard.</p>
    <p id="b825-4" data-blocks='[["BL_825.4",825,[116,431,1328,396]]]'>The third reason advanced by the board seems to us to lie at the heart of the matter. As evidence of the supposed lack of usefulness of the claimed subject matter, the board relies on Upjohn’s “voluntary withdrawal of the drug as unsafe ‘for use’,” the latter’s “own admission of unsafeness of the drug as demonstrated in the cited Suspension Order,” as well as the Suspension Order itself which, in the board’s view, demonstrates that the FDA “has ruled ‘Monase’ to be unsafe and as of today still considers the drug unsafe.”</p>
    <p id="b825-5" data-blocks='[["BL_825.5",825,[115,833,1328,451]],["BL_826.1",826,[215,229,1325,398]]]'>In view of 21 USC 372(d),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> it is no doubt true that an unequivocal finding by the FDA that a drug is totally unsafe in all circumstances of contemplated use should not be lightly regarded by the Patent Office as an aid in its determination of whether a drug is useful under 35 USC 101. But what has the FDA found here? In concluding that the FDA has ruled “Monase” to be “unsafe,” without further qualification, we think the board has painted with too broad a brush, and has drawn inferences from the Suspension Order that are not justified by its specific language. The order does <a id="p1462" href="#p1462" data-label="1462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1462</a>not contain any broad, pervasive finding, nor has Upjohn in any way “admitted,” that “Monase” is <em>completely </em>and <em>absolutely </em>unsafe under <em>all </em>conditions of use, i.e., that “Monase” is medically “useless.” What it does say, and what we understand appellant to concede here, is that <em>under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the applica-became </em>“effective.” “Monase” is unsafe for use to a degree justifying its withdrawal from the market and suspension of the effectiveness of the New Drug Application.</p>
    <p id="b826-4" data-blocks='[["BL_826.4",826,[216,635,1327,989]]]'>And what are those conditions of use upon which Upjohn’s original New Drug Application became effective? The Anglin affidavit and appellant tell us, and the Patent Office has not disagreed, that those conditions included, among others, a lack of warning attached to the label or package insert that “Monase” may produce agranulocy-tosis or at least has been associated with such a toxic effect, a condition which seems to relate more to the manner of marketing etrypta-mine than to its ultimate worth. We agree with the board that we should not speculate whether Upjohn can ever market “Monase” again with its particular postulated warning labels and restrictions, for it is unnecessary to do so. It is sufficient, we think, that the record fails to show that the FDA has ruled that “Monase” cannot be used with reasonable safety as a practical matter. The record shows that it can. In view of the limited and specific language of the finding contained therein, the Suspension Order, in our view, is not sufficient to overcome the expert testimony of Anglin, who concluded that etryptamine has been and could still be used safely by a practicing physician in spite of the possible, very low incidence of side effect that may be associated with it, so long as the physician has knowledge of that possible side effect.</p>

By what test, therefore, is utility to be determined in such cases? Is it to be done by balancing the good functions with the evil functions? <em>Or is everything useful within the meaning of the lam, if it is useS, (or is designed and adapted to he used) to accomplish a good result, though in fact it is oftener used (or is as well or even better adapted to he used) to accomplish a had one! </em>Or is utility negatived by the mere fact that the thing in question is sometimes injurious to morals, or to health, or to good order? The third hypothesis cannot stand, because if it could, it would be fatal to patents for steam engines, dynamos, electric railroads, and indeed many of the noblest inventions of the nineteenth century. [And what of such things as automobiles, airplanes, tires, power tools, explosives, lawn mowers, and drugs in the twentieth century ?] The first hypothesis cannot stand, because if it could, it would mate the validity of the patents to depend on a question of fact to which it would often be impossible to give a reliable answer. <em>The second hypothesis is the only one which is consistent with the reason of the case, and with the practical construction which the courts have given to the statutory requirement of utility,"</em>

And, if utility is found, the cases seem to be uniform that courts will not set up a measure of utility which must be filled. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
