On appeal, the Town contends that its mistaken designation of the owner as Cary Campbell on the tax lien certificates does not render the liens void. Alternatively, the Town argues that Cary’s actual knowledge of the liens precludes him from relying upon the defect. We disagree with the Town and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b416-16" data-blocks='[["BL_416.17",416,[992,787,753,1318]]]'>The relevant facts may be summarized as follows: In 1948 plaintiff Campbell Cary was deeded an undivided one-half interest in property known as Trafton Island, located in Harrington. He did not pay his property taxes for the years 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1983. The Town of Harrington, pursuant to 36 M.R.S.A. § 942, sent by certified mail notice of the nonpayment of taxes to “Cary Campbell” instead of “Campbell Cary.” After Cary failed to pay the taxes following the notice, the Town, pursuant to section 942, recorded municipal tax lien certificates for those years in the Registry of Deeds. Those certificates, once again, listed the owner as “Cary Campbell” instead of “Campbell Cary.” The Town subsequently foreclosed on the property pursuant to the automatic foreclosure provisions in 36 M.R.S.A. § 943 (1978 &amp; Supp.1987). Cary filed a complaint for declaratory judgment requesting that his present interest in the property be determined. After hearing, the Superior Court found that the tax liens were void for failure to meet the recording requirements of section 942. From this judgment, the Town appeals.</p>
