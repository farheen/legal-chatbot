On July 12, Judge Tereshko of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas found that there was insufficient time to secure Sullivan’s presence at that hearing, so he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for July 20, with Sullivan present. When, for no apparent reason, authorities failed to produce Sullivan on July 20, Judge Stephen Levin held the hearing in his absence and denied his petition. The record reveals neither why Judge Tereshko felt that Sullivan’s presence was necessary at the hearing, nor why Sullivan was not brought down as ordered.

Perhaps Sullivan could pay for bus tickets and a motel room, or perhaps he has relatives or friends willing to help transport Latifah and her mother across the state. Since frequent ten-hour round trips would clearly overburden young Latifah, perhaps Sullivan would be willing to propose a reasonable visitation schedule — every few months, or once or twice a year. If Sullivan has anything to offer towards a solution then the trial court could, at its discretion, order that Sullivan be brought down to Philadelphia to work out the details. The trial court could also arrange a visitation plan without having Sullivan brought down, or could dismiss the petition if Sullivan can offer no reasonable means of overcoming the obstacles to visitation.</p>

As long as prisoners seeking visitation have the opportunity to tell the court how they would marshall their resources to enable visitation, then they have a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Where these resources are most likely lacking, we think that routinely bringing down prisoners to hearings is an exercise in futility. The Commonwealth’s time and money would be better spent on helping arrange and support visitation plans in those cases where visitation has first been shown to be a reasonable and practical option.</p>

The mother never testified that she did not want to continue visitation with Sullivan or that she thought the trip would be too much for young Latifah; she only stated that she could not make the trip. The trial court decided that this was enough information to determine that Latifah should never make the trip.

I believe the trial court approached this case in the proper sequence, determining first what was in the child’s best interest in assessing the need to proceed further.

This presumes that, upon notice, the father is willing and able to be present. It is not uncommon for persons in distant parts of the country, who wish to contest visitation or custody, to be unable to do so personally for lack of funds or available time. Likewise, a parent incarcerated out of state could not expect to be transported to a court in Pennsylvania for a custody or visitation hearing. Undoubtedly, absent any sound basis that would preclude the child’s availability to the father, his right to a hearing to obtain visitation would be enforceable and visitation ordered. However, under these circumstances I believe the trial court must have some leeway to make a predetermination as to the reasonableness of the claim for visitation. What if the child was handicapped or in some manner incapable of long distance travel, or no person was available to transport the child or for any other of a myriad of factually sound reasons visitation was inappropriate? The most striking situation would be the case where a parent had engaged in brutal sexual or physical abuse of the child requiring incarceration of the father. The Custody Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 5301 <em>et seq., </em>provides explicit directions to consider criminal conduct in determining custody or visitation awards. Among the crimes which are to be considered, including abusive conduct as defined under the Protection From Abuse Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6101 <em>et seq., </em>are criminal homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, rape, statutory rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, incest, endangering welfare of children, prostitution and sexual abuse of children, pursuant to section 5303(b). To force the child to endure visitation or to even be present at hearings to test the father’s right, when many of those offenses are implicated, would inflict additional trauma on an already permanently damaged personality. Trial courts should be able to have a predetermination hearing before the process goes further. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em><a href="/us/424/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="424 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="12026449" data-case-paths="/us/424/0319-01">424 U.S. 319</a>, <a href="/us/424/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="424 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="12026449" data-case-paths="/us/424/0319-01">96 S.Ct. 893</a>, <a href="/us/424/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="424 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="12026449" data-case-paths="/us/424/0319-01">47 L.Ed.2d 18</a> (1976).

If the right to retain that relationship was fundamentally irrevocable, we would require prisons to provide condominium-like resources to enable the family to retain at least a quasi-normal relationship between the inmate and his/her family. Women with children born in prison are separated from them and not all are guaranteed the access that appellant demands here. Nothing could be more important for an appellant incarcerated for murder or any other crime, who elects to defend himself pro se on appeal, than to be present to argue his case in court. This case has been appealed pro se and the appellant is not entitled to be present in court to argue his appeal. Yet we deny this right although the Constitution guarantees every defendant the right to be his own counsel. If the situation were otherwise, the highways and byways of the Commonwealth would be clogged with inmates filing petitions for visitation or regarding other family matters to the extent that the critically burdened sheriffs’ departments and local restraining facilities would face collapse. Prisoners will do anything possible to obtain even a brief respite from the ardors, boredom and pressures of long-term confinement.</p>

Another important factor in assessing the impact of official action on the right is the possible length of deprivation of benefits to the individual.
