    <blockquote id="b796-3" data-blocks='[["BL_796.4",796,[262,400,1256,493]]]'>1. Claims 1-5 are method claims. They relate to the analysis of a system and the adjustment of the parameters of that system in such a manner as to cause the system to operate in the best possible manner. Phister has been added as a citation for its illustration of the type of system discussed by Munson and Rubin. * * * Phister shows a system * ⅜ ⅝ adapted to be controlled to operate in the best possible manner. Phister’s system was to be controlled by a computer, but it could also be controlled by hand, with manual adjustment of the parameter controls and mental analysis of the results of the adjustment. Munson and Rubin recognize the possibility of such hand control in their statement * * * that “this random search method could be followed by hand computation or by digital as well as analog means.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b796-4" data-blocks='[["BL_796.5",796,[261,907,1256,444]]]'>2. But applicant, by his method claims, is attempting to acquire a monopoly on a method of doing this analysis and adjustment by hand. Consider the Phister apparatus with the computer removed. Instead of signals oc^ thru an furnishing input data to .the computer, have them presented directly to an operator on meter dials, as has long been done in the control rooms of processing plants. Instead of signals <em>dt </em>thru 5m being-sent from the computer <em>to control </em>the process, have <em>them originate </em>in manually operated switches and dials, as is now done in the control rooms of processing plants. Then the operator could sit in the control room, watch the indicating dials, and adjust the control signals in any manner which seemed suitable.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b796-5" data-blocks='[["BL_796.6",796,[260,1369,1254,241]]]'>3. The operator, if he wished, could change the control signals in a random manner, as suggested by Munson and Rubin, and note the control signal values thus randomly chosen which improved the performance of the system. Or the operator, if he wished, could change the control signals in the same direction which had been improving the performance of the system in the previous changes, after the manner of Draper et al.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b796-6" data-blocks='[["BL_796.7",796,[258,1624,1256,406]]]'>4. Or, having found the parameters necessary for improved performance by the random method of Munson and Rubin, he might decide that he should change the parameters a little further in the same direction, with the possibility of improving the performance a little more. After that he might again try the random method of Munson and Rubin. The latter sequence was random, then historical, then random; it was an obvious and purely mental, change from the method of optimization offered by Munson and Rubin, and it was a purely mental change from the method of process control used since man first began to observe, then control, processes.</blockquote>

The applicant contends that a process is not purely mental if it can be carried out completely by instrumentality. In response to this the examiner contends that if a claim can be met by a purely mental operation, it makes no difference that it can also be met by an instrumentality. Applicant is not claiming an instrumentality — he is claiming a method; he should not be allowed a method claim simply because it <em>can </em>be carried out on an instrumentality. By his method claim applicant is, on the face of the claim, attempting to monopolize a method in which his only improvement is a mental step. If he does not intend this, then his claim is incorrectly <a id="p1433" href="#p1433" data-label="1433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1433</a>drafted. If lie does, intend this, then the fact that it may also read on an instrumentality is irrelevant.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b797-4" data-blocks='[["BL_797.4",797,[138,304,1257,453]]]'>6. Consider the applicability of the above argument to claim 1. Claim 1 calls for generating input functions (⅝ thru an as they appear on meters in the control room), calculating the value of a scalar function (purely a mental function, carried out in the brain of the operator), comparing the value of the scalar function with the value thereof as calculated at the precedent state (purely a mental function, carried out in the brain of the operator), and progressively varying the input function (with control signals <em>dt </em>thru <em>dm). </em>The statement that these changes correspond to the weighted resultant of a random vector and a controlled (historical) vector is * * * merely a statement of how the operator thought in deciding how to change the control signal * * *.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b797-5" data-blocks='[["BL_797.5",797,[138,769,1257,446]]]'>7. Claims 2-5 read in the same manner upon the usual method of manually controlling a process with the exception of the purely mental steps involved. As with claim 1 discussed above in paragraph B (6), the prior art (for example that represented by Phister) meets all of the physical Steps. The COPA <em>(In re Abrams, </em><a href="/ccpa/38-2/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="38 C.C.P.A. 945" data-case-ids="6084118" data-case-paths="/ccpa/38-2/0945-01">38 CCPA 945</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20266" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="266 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 266">266 USPQ 266</a>, 267-268) has cited with approval the following rule. “If a method claim embodies both positive and physical steps as well as so-called mental steps, yet the alleged novelty or advance over the art resides in one or more of the so-called mental steps, then the claim is considered unpatentable for the same reason that it would be if all the steps were purely mental in character.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b797-6" data-blocks='[["BL_797.6",797,[139,1234,1258,574]]]'>8. For example, in method claims 1-5, that change which is random can be distinguished from a non-random change only by considering the mental processes involved in deciding upon that change. <em>Webster’s New International Dictionary, </em>unabridged, 2nd ed. defines random as “without definite aim, direction, rule, or method.” The mental processes themselves determine whether any rule or method is followed or whether a definite aim or direction is sought. Only through knowing the mental processes involved can one determine whether a given set of mentally directed results were or were not random. If ten coins are flipped, the results will be a random distribution of heads and tails — it could still be random and be ten heads or ten tails or any number between. But if someone wanted five heads and five tails, and he carefully set the coins to five and five, then the results would be non-random — even though five and five is the most probable random result.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b797-7" data-blocks='[["BL_797.7",797,[140,1823,1255,75]]]'>9. Additionally, in applicant’s method claims, storing a function is a mental step easily carried out with the human memory.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b797-8" data-blocks='[["BL_797.8",797,[139,1911,1257,283]]]'>10. Thus claims 1-5 have been finally rejected as unpatentable over previous methods of controlling a process (as represented by Phister et al., by Draper et al. and by Munson and Rubin), the only true novelty in applicant’s method being in the mental steps. Although Phister is added of record in this Examiner’s Answer, it merely illustrates what Munson and Rubin assume when they write of a process which can be controlled by hand or by digital means.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b797-9" data-blocks='[["BL_797.9",797,[139,2208,1258,198]],["BL_798.1",798,[270,229,1253,73]]]'>11. Applicant also contends that he has patentable novelty in the types of changes which are worked on the parameters of the system and, presumably, that even if the steps of deciding what those changes are to be is mental, the step of effecting the changes, being physical, carries its physical attributes over to the types of changes made. The examiner contends <a id="p1434" href="#p1434" data-label="1434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1434</a>that the type of changes made, are no different, except perhaps in sequence, from the types of changes made in any method of controlling the process.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b798-4" data-blocks='[["BL_798.4",798,[271,313,1253,530]]]'>12. In the event the Board considers that the type of change makes the step of effecting that change a step, with its novelty in its physical aspects, then the examiner contends that the claim does not fall within that class of methods intended by Congress to fall under the heading of “process” in 35 USC 101. It is obvious that Congress did not intend for the Patent Office to deliberately issue patents which could be infringed by a process which the patentee and the courts cannot distinguish from a non-infringing process. This is one reason for refusing patents to processes in which the novelty is in one or more mental steps. In the present invention the only way to determine the type of change intended is by reference to the mental steps. This is shown in paragraph B (8) above. Thus the methods claimed could not fall within the definition of “process” intended by Congress.</blockquote>

However, in our review of the record, we are unable to discern the slightest indication that the examiner relied upon sections 101 and 103 <em>in combination </em>to form a single rejection. To the contrary, the examiner apparently made two separate rejections of claims 1-5, one under 35 USC 101 and another under 35 USC 103, the latter rejection having been expressly reversed by the board. Accordingly, it appears <em>from the record </em>that section 103 is no longer in issue before us. Perhaps the solicitor’s and appellant’s confusion, which is apparent from our discussion of their positions, arises from the previously quoted portion from the board’s opinion responsive to appellant’s request for clarification. But since the board has made no new ground of rejection under Buie 196(b), it merely affirmed the examiner’s rejection which, as we have indicated, is apparently based only upon 35 USC 101.</p>
