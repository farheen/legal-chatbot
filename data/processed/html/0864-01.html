Appellant’s basic idea is adding: <a id="p868" href="#p868" data-label="868" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*868</a>another roller to the type of sugar mill in general use, to secure one additional crushing of the cane within the same space occupied by the ordinary mill. The Guy patent proposes to add one or more rollers to secure additional crushings of the cane, and also to economize in space required.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[241,490,1322,184]]]'>We take it there is no invention in the mere idea of adding additional rollers to an ordinary sugar mill. The invention, if any there be, consists in the means used and method of operation to secure the desired result.</p>
    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[241,690,1323,493]]]'>We have already referred to the fact that the specification of the Guy patent consists of 6 j&gt;ages of description, and 23 sheets of drawings, containing 54 figures. These various figures show a multitude of combinations of rollers, with varying points of feeding the cane to the rollers, and many different combinations of rotary motion of the rollers. There are so many of these combinations, so many of them clearly inoperable, that- we are inclined to agree with appellant that the patentee Guy had no conception at all of a combination of rollers, arid method of their operation', that would produce the result claimed by him.</p>
    <p id="b318-6" data-blocks='[["BL_318.6",318,[237,1190,1323,342]]]'>It is a significant circumstance that in the large number of figures set out, comprising so many combinations of rollers and methods of operation, none of them disclose completely the plan of appellant.

    <p id="b318-7" data-blocks='[["BL_318.7",318,[231,1540,1328,343]]]'>Out of the 54 figures of the drawings of Guy, the tribunals of the Patent Office selected three which, in connection with the description in the Guy specification, are held to disclose the invention claimed by appellant. But it is admitted by the Board of Appeals that each of these three combinations would require change and adaptation to read on appellant’s claims in connection with his specification and .drawings. The three so selected are figures 1A, 27, and 21</p>
    <p id="b318-8" data-blocks='[["BL_318.8",318,[235,1889,1323,492]]]'>Figures 1A and 27 of Guy are identical except as to the relative position of the outer rollers to the central roller. The point of feeding and rotary motion of the rollers are the same in each figure. Both are clearly inoperable for the reason that the bagasse Ayould not move in the direction specified without additional means being provided to give it motion between its leaving the rollers after one crushing to be taken up by the rollers to give it the next crushing. The space between the top .and back roller is too great for the motions of the top c’enter and back roller to move the bagasse upwards from the back to the top roller.</p>

These changes, they hold, would not involve invention. We may observe that in both figures Guy adopts the point of feeding and rotation of rollers employed in the ordinary 3-roller mill. While it may seem obvious now that a change in the point of feeding and reversing the motion of the rollers would produce the some combination and result claimed by appellant, it evidently was not obvious for nearly 40 years, the Guy patent being issued in 1890, for the examiner in his answer refers to the 3-roller mill as the “ standard mill.”</p>

TT2. With this in mind, said Figures 1A and <em>21 </em>of the Guy patent show that the two lower rollers in each figure are spaced so far apart that even if a turn plate is provided, as in appellant’s specification, it is doubtful if the bagasse would be carried from one roller to the other without additional means of propulsion.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[115,1334,1322,536]]]'>The tribunals of the Patent Office also rejected the application upon Figure 21 of Guy. This figure shows a combination of 11 rollers, providing 14 crushings of bagasse. The point of feeding is relatively the same, and the rotary motion of the rollers is in' the same direction, as in appellant’s specification. The Board of Appeals holds that the elimination of seven rollers would result in appellant’s combination. It is clear that this would involve an entire reconstruction of the mill, and even when so reconstructed, the position of the two lower rollers would be so far apart as to render it inoperative without additional means of moving the bagasse from one roller to another.</p>
