    <p id="b496-15" data-blocks='[["BL_496.15",496,[184,2312,765,366]]]'>This is an appeal from the judgment of sentence following a non-jury trial in which Edward Allen Yereb (Appellant) was found guilty of driving while under suspension,driving under the influence (DUI) related.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant was sentenced to ninety days imprisonment and assessed a $1,000.00 fine. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b496-16" data-blocks='[["BL_496.16",496,[990,245,754,707]]]'>The facts and procedural history of this case can be summarized as follows: Sometime before Monday, May 13, 1996, an unnamed informant complained to the Chief of Police of the Southwest Mercer County Regional Police Department that Appellant had been driving while his license was suspended. Before acting on this tip, • someone in the department checked the information in the computer. After verifying that the driver’s license was suspended, the chief gave this information, including a description of the vehicle, its plate number and Appellant’s description, to Officer Jon Christopher Rococi (Officer Rococi).</p>
    <p id="b496-17" data-blocks='[["BL_496.17",496,[988,976,755,566]]]'>While on traffic patrol within his jurisdiction, Officer Rococi noticed Appellant driving a vehicle which fit the description his chief had given to him and proceeded to stop the vehicle. During'the stop, Appellant produced registration and insurance cards, but failed to produce a driver’s license. At that point, Officer Rococi once again verified that Appellant’s license had been suspended. Therefore, Officer Rococi issued a citation under section 1543(b) of the Vehicle Code for driving while under suspension, DUI related.</p>
    <p id="b496-18" data-blocks='[["BL_496.18",496,[986,1564,754,276]]]'>Appellant first appeared before a district justice, where he was convicted. He then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.

    <p id="b497-16" data-blocks='[["BL_497.16",497,[919,1435,754,420]]]'>When Appellant was stopped, Officer Ro-coci ran his name through the computer. In doing so, Officer Rococi verified that Appellant’s license had been suspended. Thus, he issued a citation to Appellant for a violation of 75 Pa.C.S.A section 1543(b). Officer Ro-coci added a comment to the citation, indicating that it was a “DUI Related Suspension.” Citation, 5/13/96.</p>
    <p id="b497-17" data-blocks='[["BL_497.17",497,[918,1896,756,373]]]'>Appellant argues that this citation was facially incorrect on two counts: first, Officer Rococi did not indicate which part of subsection 1543(b) Appellant had violated, and second, Appellant’s license had been suspended because he was a habitual offender, not a DUI offender. Neither of these arguments has any merit.</p>
    <p id="b497-18" data-blocks='[["BL_497.18",497,[918,2296,756,467]],["BL_498.1",498,[178,243,755,859]]]'>We cannot agree with Appellant’s assertion that subsection 1543(b)(1) is a separate offense from subsection 1543(b)(2). A careful reading of the statute reveals that subsection 1543(b)(2) is merely a clarification of when the more severe penalty set forth in subsection 1543(b)(1) applies. The introductory language of subsection (b)(2) chosen by the legislature demonstrates this fact: “This subsection shall apply.... This provision <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>shall also apply_” The only other provision or subsection to which this language could possibly refer is subsection (b)(1). Importantly, subsection 1543(b)(2) does not state <em>any </em>penalty, while subsections (a) and (b)(1) both state separate penalties. This structure of the statute indicates that, had our legislature intended subsection (b)(2) to act as a separate offense, it would have indicated an appropriate penalty. Adopting Appellant’s position would create the odd situation where the legislature has established an offense without a penalty. The legislature could not have intended such a result. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.SA. § 1922(1); <em>Commonwealth v. Ha</em>gan, <a href="/pa/539/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="539 Pa. 609" data-case-ids="474164" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0609-01">539 Pa. 609</a>, 616, <a href="/pa/539/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="654 A.2d 541" data-case-ids="474164,7868504" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0609-01,/a2d/654/0541-01">654 A.2d 541</a>, 545 (1995) (“in construing statutes, we presume the legislature did not intend an absurd result”).</p>
    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[178,1124,753,496]]]'>As to Appellant’s argument that his habitual offender suspension was not DUI related, we similarly find no merit. The record reveals that the triggering offense for Appellant’s five-year license suspension was a DUI violation. N.T., 1/3/97, at 10 &amp; 11. Based on this fact, Officer Rococi simply noted on the citation that Appellant’s section 1542 suspension was “DUI related.” <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Keene, </em><a href="/pa-super/445/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="445 Pa. Super. 286" data-case-ids="725790" data-case-paths="/pa-super/445/0286-01">445 Pa.Super. 286</a>, 289-91, <a href="/pa-super/445/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="665 A.2d 495" data-case-ids="725790,7866436" data-case-paths="/pa-super/445/0286-01,/a2d/665/0495-01">665 A.2d 495</a>, 497 (1995).</p>
    <p id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[178,1642,756,672]]]'>Importantly, Appellant does not demonstrate how these alleged errors on the face of the citation prejudiced his defense. While he contends that subsection (b)(2) somehow requires the prosecution to prove different elements from (b)(1), we disagree. As we have shown, <em>supra, </em>subsection (b)(2) merely qualifies subsection (b)(1). Thus, the prosecution is required to prove the same elements in each and every subsection 1543(b) prosecution. Therefore, we hold that the citation to subsection 1543(b) was specific enough to put Appellant on notice of what violation he would need to defend at trial and Appellant’s first contention fails.</p>
    <p id="b498-7" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[178,2350,756,406]]]'>Second, Appellant contends that the traffic stop itself was illegal. As this Court has most recently stated: “A police officer is authorized to stop a vehicle and secure information necessary to enforce the Motor Vehicle Code if he has articulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a violation of the Code.” <em>Commonwealth v. Arroyo, </em><a href="/pa-super/455/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="455 Pa.

    <p id="b498-8" data-blocks='[["BL_498.7",498,[980,240,755,461]]]'>In the instant case, the chief of police received an anonymous tip that Appellant was driving while his license was suspended. After this information was verified, the chief instructed Officer Rococi to watch for Appellant. The chief gave him a description of the car and Appellant, as well as the car’s tag number. When Officer Rococi saw the car being driven by a person who fit the description of Appellant, he stopped him.</p>
    <p id="b498-9" data-blocks='[["BL_498.8",498,[980,720,753,606]]]'>Appellant argues before this Court that the information given to Officer Rococi by his chief was unverified and thus, inadmissible hearsay. Therefore, he contends, the traffic stop itself was illegal. We cannot agree. Officer Rococi testified on both direct and cross-examination that the information about Appellant had been verified both before and after the traffic stop. N.T., 1/3/97, at 5 &amp; 12. Appellant’s real argument is that the Commonwealth never produced documentary evidence of the fact that the police ran the check before the traffic stop.</p>
    <p id="b498-10" data-blocks='[["BL_498.9",498,[980,1348,753,648]]]'>The problem with this argument is that evidence of the initial check was before the trial judge in the manner of Officer Rocoei’s testimony. We have never held that the Commonwealth must produce documentary evidence of such a check and decline to do so now. Instead, as we have noted on many occasions, “The credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence are matters within the province of the trier of fact, the fact finder is free to believe all, some or none of the evidence.” <em>Commonwealth v.
