This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 9, 2006, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that this appeal may be decided at this time, without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we deny and dismiss the appeal.</p>
    <p id="b552-7" data-blocks='[["BL_552.7",552,[198,1442,757,811]]]'>This case originated as a zoning appeal that was filed in the Superior Court for Washington County pursuant to G.L.1956 § 45-24-69.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The plaintiffs had appealed to the Superior Court from an April 25, 2001 decision of the Westerly Zoning Board of Review regarding the development proposed by defendant B.S.I., Inc. (B.S.I.) for the Watch Hill section of that town. (The proposal centered on the construction of a motel.) In its decision of April 25, 2001, the Zoning Board rejected plaintiffs’ challenge to the zoning official’s preliminary approval of project drawings for the motel that had been submitted by B.S.I.</p>

Then, a short time later, it filed a new and revised application for a special-use permit. In March of 2003, the zoning board granted B.S.I.’s application for a special-use permit, and that decision prompted the filing of two new zoning appeals by the Watch Hill Fire District and the plaintiffs in the instant action on March 31, 2003 and April 1, 2003 respectively (WC 2003-181 and WC 2003-185).</p>

Very shortly thereafter, on October 6, 2004, the same justice of the Superior Court issued an order in the instant action (WC 2001-299) requiring plaintiffs to show cause why the proceeding should not be dismissed. On November 24, 2004, the Superior Court issued an order granting appellees’ motion to dismiss the instant action as moot.</p>
