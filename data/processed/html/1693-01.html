The application at bar, as we would guess from the power of attorney, and as solicitor’s brief in a footnote says is shown by the Patent Office assignment records, but with no such record before us, is assigned to Humble Oil &amp; Refining Company.</p>

On its face, this patent was issued to Esso Research and Engineering Company, assignee of Lonnie W. Vernon. We shall refer to it as the Vernon patent.</p>

Since the case seems to have proceeded on this assumption and no one disputes it, for the purposes of our decision we shall assume common ownership of the Vernon patent and the Dinwiddie application though it is not substantiated by the record and may not in fact exist. The Vernon patent also contains a reference to this Dinwiddie application, to which we shall refer later, but the application does not refer to Vernon’s application or patent. Of slight interest is the fact that the record addresses of Dinwiddie and Vernon are both Baytown, Texas.</p>

Were we to go by the specification, what the appellant says he invented would include considerable subject matter which he no longer claims as his invention, for reasons unknown to us and about which we do not particularly care. From reading several office actions and responses thereto, we surmise that we have before us that not unusual situation in which the specification describes more invention than the appellant is permitted to claim by reason of what turned up in the prior art cited, in consequence of which he gradually restricts his claims and the examiner gradually withdraws his rejections until there is distilled out that subject matter which is clear of the prior art and properly defined. Upon reaching that point, appellant was faced with the holding, in effect, that the Vernon patent contains all the patent protection to which the common assignee is entitled on the inventions disclosed by Dinwiddie and Vernon.  In passing on that issue, though a “double patenting” rejection is based only on the <em>claims </em>of an issued patent, there are inextricably involved here statements of fact in both Vernon’s specification and in appellant’s specification. With this warning, we will now attempt a general description of Dinwiddie’s invention.</p>

      <a id="p1696" href="#p1696" data-label="1696" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1696</a>The invention has to do broadly with catalytic conversion of a fluent feed stock by, inter alia, passing it through a finely divided bed of solid catalyst at appropriate temperatures and pressures. To illustrate, a solid bed of known catalyst is provided and heated gaseous butylenes are passed through it, resulting in the conversion of perhaps half of the butylenes into butadiene; or butane is similarly converted into butene. The conversion products of the catalytic reaction are thereafter separated. This is old. What is desired is to improve the. efficiency of the process to maximize producton of the desired products. There are a great many such conversions which one might wish to effect. There are two general aspects to the invention of appellant's process as disclosed. First, a fluent <em>carrier </em>is continuously flowed through an elongated catalyst bed. Second, the feed stock or material being converted is periodically introduced into the carrier in <em>pulses. </em>We need not go into the details of why the pulse feed into the continuously flowing carrier is advantageous except to say that it promotes the separation of the resulting products and the efficiency of the operation. The patentability of the invention over the prior art insofar as novelty and unobviousness are concerned is not in question. No <em>prior </em>art is seriously relied on.</p>

The carrier should be in the same state as the feed material. Thus, the carrier should be volatilized for vapor phase conversion processes and should be in a liquid condition for liquid phase conversion processes.</blockquote>

To see <em>what </em>it is Vernon is claiming it is necessary to look at his specification for the purpose of understanding the claims, though the specification is not otherwise involved on this rejection. Claims of this type cannot be understood in a vacuum.

Similarly, claims 2-5 all specify a stream of hydrogen in a hydrodesulfurization process to <em>continuously reduce </em>any metal sulfides formed. This leaves claim 6 as the only claim which could have any possible bearing on a double patenting rejection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It uses a fluent stream of carbon dioxide in a butylene to butadiene dehydrogenation process with catalyst consisting of 77% Fe203, 20% K2C03, and 3% Cr203.

Claim 6 does not speak expressly of any reaction of the carbon dioxide but claim 6 is practically a “picture claim” of the second example of the specification which concludes with this statement by Vernon who, presumably, understood his own process:</p>

    <p id="b1025-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1025.5",1025,[171,734,1327,348]]]'>The board has looked at the process of claim 6 and came to its own conclusion that since it sees nothing with which the carbon dioxide would react it must be “inert” in the process. But the specification indicates that there is likelihood of <em>reduction </em>of the catalyst and that the presence of the carbon dioxide, <em>as an </em>oxidizer, will inhibit it. Appellant’s brief gives a concrete explanation which is more appealing to us than the board’s unsupported speculation. It is:</p>
    <p id="b1025-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1025.6",1025,[169,1109,1327,367]]]'>In the dehydrogenation of butylenes to butadiene in claim 6 of Vernon, hydrogen is produced. Moreover, the presence of the hydrocarbon (which is also a reducing agent) together with the produced hydrogen provides a reducing atmosphere which if not counteracted will ultimately deactivate the catalyst as described by the patentee. In short, what happens in the Vernon process, as defined by claim 6 particularly, is that the catalyst components tend to become reduced to the several metals. Carbon dioxide, as stated by the patentee, provides an oxidizing atmosphere which re-oxidizes the catalyst as it becomes partially reduced and thus maintains the catalyst in its catalytically active form.</p>

Viewing the Vernon patent as a whole and comparing it with appellant’s application, we are in complete disagreement with the examiner that in them there is but a single “inventive concept.” We see two distinct inventions fully justifying two separate applications. The only basis for an argument that appellant is not entitled to all of his otherwise patentable claims is the single exceedingly narrow claim 6 of Vernon defining a process in which appellant insists the carrier gas is reactive. Appellant, contrariwise, has limited all of his claims expressly to inert carriers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> With this limitation the Patent Office has found him <a id="p1702" href="#p1702" data-label="1702" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1702</a>clear of the prior art and we find him to be likewise clear of Vernon’s patent claims.</p>
    <p id="b1026-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1026.4",1026,[322,399,1329,1058]]]'>Appellant’s principal contribution to this art appears to us to be, and Vernon’s patent acknowledges it to be, introduction of the feed stock in <em>pulses </em>or bursts. In fact, the examiner and solicitor contend that pulsing is the <em>only </em>patentable feature here involved. Appellant, however, has limited the claims to his invention to pulse feed into an <em>inert </em>carrier. Vernon’s invention is maintaining the catalytic activity <em>in </em>such a pulse feed operation by using a <em>reactive </em>carrier. Vernon’s <em>limitation </em>of his process claims to pulse feed seems to us of no significance, contrary to the solicitor’s contention. Possibly Vernon’s invention is operative only in such a system. In any event, we cannot see in his claim 6, or in any other claim, the grant of any protection <em>on appellant's invention. </em> The essence of <em>double </em>patenting, in all of its ramifications, is that a patent has already issued on an invention or on the patentable substance of it or that an attempt is being made to patent an obvious modification of an already patented invention. We are unable to see such a situation here, nor any time-wise extension of a patent monopoly already granted, the usual basis of the “double patenting” objection. Vernon’s claim 6 does not protect appellant’s invention, nor could Vernon have a patent claim to it for he is not the inventor, as the law requires, which his patent admits. <em>In re </em>Sarett, supra.</p>
