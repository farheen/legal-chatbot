Several days later, while still on post-operative care after surgery on her right hip, she fell from her bed and fractured her left hip. Appellee sued the hospital, alleging that it had been negligent in leaving her unattended and in failing to protect her from falling out of bed. A jury returned a verdict in her favor and awarded damages. The hospital brings this appeal, arguing that the trial court erred (1) in treating this case as one of ordinary negligence, rather than one involving the exercise of professional medical judgment and requiring appellee to present expert testimony, which she did not do,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and (2) in instructing the jury on the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>We reject both arguments and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>

She went to investigate and found appellee sitting on the floor. Returning to the nurses’ station, Massey told Sharon Miller, a registered nurse, that appellee had fallen. Both nurses went to appellee’s room and, after examining her, placed her back in bed and called the doctor.</p>

Nurse Miller said that she believed appellee must have been in restraints prior to her fall, because when she and Nurse Massey went to appellee’s room to put her back in bed, they had to lower the side rails on the bed. Her belief was buttressed by the fact that the wrist restraints were tied to the side rails, since these restraints could not be tied to the rails unless the rails were up. Miller was impeached with a report she had written which stated that appellee “was left unrestrained on a.m. shift,” although she offered an explanation for this apparently inconsistent statement. She also admitted that there was nothing in her report or in any other hospital record indicating that the side rails were up or that appellee had been in restraints before she fell.</p>

Here, however, the issues before the jury were whether appellee was in fact under restraints immediately prior to her fall and, if not, whether the hospital was negligent in leaving her unattended.

Appellant contends that a decision that fall cases do not always require expert testimony will be somehow inconsistent with this court’s decision in <em>Morrison v. MacNamara, </em><a href="/a2d/407/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="407 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="7975315" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0555-01">407 A.2d 555</a> (D.C.App. 1979). Appellant misreads <em>Morrison. </em>The plaintiff in that case, while undergoing a urethral smear examination in a standing position, fainted and struck his head on a metal stand and on the floor, causing serious injury. Experts testified that according to the national standards established for this type of examination, the patient should have been sitting or lying down when it was administered. Both at trial and on appeal, the principal issue was whether the applicable standard of care was that of the entire nation or of the immediate locality; we held that the national standard applied. Insofar as <em>Morrison </em>is pertinent to this case, it is distinguishable. In <em>Morrison </em>the issue was whether it was good medical practice to administer the test to a standing patient. To do so involved an exercise of medical judgment, and thus expert testimony was appropriate. In the case at bar, however, no claim was <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>made that appellee’s fall was the result of an erroneous <em>medical </em>decision.</p>

The doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>applies when three conditions are met: “(1) the event must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone’s negligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant; (3) it must not have been due to any voluntary action on the part of the plaintiff.” W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts § 39, at 214 (4th ed. 1971), cited with approval in <em>Sullivan v. Snyder, </em><a href="/a2d/374/0866-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="374 A.2d 866" data-case-ids="8018483" data-case-paths="/a2d/374/0866-01">374 A.2d 866</a>, 867-868 (D.C.App.1977). The trial court’s instruction failed to mention the third of these requirements. At oral argument, however, appellant specifically waived any claim of error with respect to this omission.</p>
