      <em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[164,651,1133,350]]]'>Respondent Harriet Bundley was discharged from her position with appellant Clark County School District as an “in-house suspension’ ’ teacher. According to the termination notice, Bundley was discharged for several general reasons and, specifically, for being “absent without leave” on eight occasions — January 18, 19, and 20, 2005, and February 9, 10, 17, 18, and 24, 2005 — for a total of seven full days, despite having previously received relevant admonishments.</p>
    <p id="b613-6" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[165,1017,1131,361]]]'>Thereafter, Bundley filed for unemployment benefits, which she was granted by respondent Employment Security Division of the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation. The school district challenged Bundley’s right to receive those benefits, however, alleging that Bundley was discharged for misconduct in connection with her work. Specifically, the school district indicated that Bundley had “excessive attendance” problems, of which she had been warned could lead to job loss.</p>
    <p id="b613-7" data-blocks='[["BL_613.7",613,[164,1384,1134,769]]]'>Before and at the subsequent administrative hearing, the school district submitted as evidence four written admonishments that Bundley had received in the fall of 2004, reminding her that she (1) had been absent five days since the beginning of the school year, and late once; (2) had in some instances notified the wrong person of her absences, and was instead required to report any absences to, and obtain approval therefor from, the principal or assistant principal; and (3) had, apparently before May 26, 2004, experienced some problems with excessive absences and/or absences taken before a sufficient amount of leave had accrued. While the school’s principal stated, during the hearing, that Bundley had been discharged for attendance problems, her testimony focused on one precipitating factor: Bundley’s alleged failure to report her absences on February 17, 18, and 24, 2005. With regard to this issue, the principal relayed that neither herself, nor the assistant principal or school secretaries, recalled Bundley having called in on those three days.</p>
    <p id="b613-8" data-blocks='[["BL_613.8",613,[164,2160,1135,315]],["BL_614.1",614,[262,263,1129,216]]]'>Bundley, on the other hand, testified that she had called in to report those absences and had spoken once to the assistant principal and twice to the principal. She also testified that she was absent because she had to see a doctor about her broken foot and, on February 24th, to take care of her ill daughter, whose illness was apparently the result of a continuing medical condition of which the school was aware. Bundley averred that she had applied, <a id="p1444" href="#p1444" data-label="1444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1444</a>or had planned to apply, for additional sick leave from the school’s sick leave bank. Finally, she indicated that she was willing to submit documentation to support her claims as to having called the school on the days in question, broken her foot, and-applied for leave from the sick leave bank.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[261,493,1131,539]]]'>After the hearing concluded, an appeals referee determined that the school principal’s assertions that Bundley had not phoned to report her absences were more credible. The appeals referee thus concluded that Bundley was discharged because of attendance problems and her failure to notify her employer that she would be absent on February 17, 18, and 24, in contravention of the school’s policy. According to the appeals referee, Bundley’s failure to notify her employer of her inability to report to work on those three days constituted misconduct disqualifying her from receiving benefits under NRS 612.385, which provides that an employee who is discharged for work-related misconduct may not receive benefits. Bundley administratively appealed.</p>
    <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[260,1038,1131,451]]]'>After reviewing the evidence that had been presented to the appeals referee, the Board of Review reversed the appeals referee’s decision, determining that Bundley had credibly testified that her absence on the days in question was due to her and her daughter’s illnesses and that she had timely notified her supervisor of those absences. Noting that Bundley was admittedly absent without leave but that nothing appeared in the record to show that Bundley had failed to report her absences, the Board concluded that, for unemployment benefits purposes, mere absence resulting from illness is not disqualifying misconduct.</p>
