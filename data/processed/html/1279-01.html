The trial court determined that the arbitration clause on which Tippins relies was merely a part of its offer of purchase and never became a part of the parties’ contract. The court determined, in addition, that the parties formed a contract through course of conduct pursuant to section 2207(c) of the Pennsylvania Commercial Code that did not include an arbitration provision. Upon review, we conclude that the trial court did not commit reversible error. Consequently, we affirm the court’s order.</p>

Tippins, a Pittsburgh company then engaged in the construction of a steel rolling mill in the <a id="p1281" href="#p1281" data-label="1281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1281</a>Czech Republic, sought to purchase gear drive assemblies from Flender Corporation for installation at the new facility. In January 1998, Tippins mailed a purchase order to Flender specifying terms of sale. The order limited the form in which Flen-der could acknowledge and accept Tip-pins’s offer and required that the parties’ disputes under any resulting contract be submitted to arbitration. The order stated Tippins’s terms as follows: “Tippins[’s] purchase order is expressly limited to acceptance of ‘Standard General Conditions Nova Hut Purchase Order’ and special conditions of purchase, which take precedence over any terms and conditions written on the back of the purchase order.” The “Standard General Conditions Nova Hut Purchase Order” included the arbitration clause at issue here, requiring that all claims or disputes arising out of the contract must be submitted to arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce in Vienna, Austria, and would be governed by Austrian law. Moreover, the order limited the form of Flender’s acceptance as follows: “AS PART OF THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THE ATTACHED ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM OF THE PURCHASE ORDER “MUST” BE SIGNED AND RETURNED.... [NEITHER] TIPPINS NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES RECOGNIZES ANY OTHER DOCUMENT AS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT.”</p>
    <p id="b1329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.5",1329,[71,2193,755,506]]]'>¶3 Flender did not sign the attached acknowledgment form or issue any other written acceptance of Tippins’s offer, but instead manufactured and shipped the finished drive assemblies. Flender’s invoice, which accompanied the drive assemblies, provided “Conditions of Sale and Delivery” that attached conditions to Flender’s acceptance of Tippins’s order. Flender’s conditions provided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.6",1329,[911,293,713,767]]]'>[Tjhese terms and conditions will govern all quotations covering purchase orders for and sales of Seller’s products and are the sole terms and conditions on which the order of buyer will be accepted.

Buyer’s agreement and Buyer’s form containing inconsistent or material terms shall not be deemed a specific objection to any terms hereof.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.7",1329,[874,1082,750,187]]]'>The invoice did not, however, require that Tippins accept these additional terms in order for the parties to form a binding contract.</p>
    <p id="b1329-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1329.8",1329,[871,1298,755,870]]]'>¶ 4 The invoice also provided a mechanism for dispute resolution. The dispute resolution clause required that “exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any dispute arising out of or with respect to this Agreement or otherwise relating to the commercial relationships of the parties shall be vested in the Federal and/or State Courts located in Chicago, Illinois .... ” Tippins accepted and installed the gear drives but, subsequently, failed to pay the balance due on the shipment. Flender then commenced this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking to recover an amount outstanding of $238,663.15, plus $76,372.16 in service charges.</p>

The trial court, the Honorable Ronald W. Folino, denied Tippins’s objections, reasoning that the arbitration clause on which Tippins relied had been “knocked out” because it <a id="p1282" href="#p1282" data-label="1282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1282</a>was materially different from the dispute resolution clause in Flender’s invoice. Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/02, at 4-5. The court concluded, in addition, that because both parties proceeded with the transaction as if they had a contract, although neither party had accepted the other’s terms, the only contract they could be deemed to have was established by course of conduct under section 2207(c) of the Pennsylvania Commercial Code. Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/02, at 4. Because such an implied contract was, per force, silent on the issue of dispute resolution, it posed no impediment to litigation of Flender’s complaint in the Court of Common Pleas. Tippins then filed this interlocutory appeal of right pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. section 7320(a)(1) and Appellate Rule 311(a)(8).</p>

Upon review, we note that Tippins’s questions “A,” “B,” and “C” appear to address points of argument in support of question “D,” and are properly considered in connection with it. We note also that Tippins’s argument is not divided so as to correspond with the foregoing questions. Such a lack of correspondence violates the Rules of Appellate Procedure and burdens our ability to respond to Tippins’s questions as posed. <em>See </em>Pa.

All parties agree that Commercial Code section 2207 and cases applying it are dispositive of the issue before us. They disagree sharply, however, concerning which subsections apply and whether the difference in provisions governing dispute resolution apparent in the parties’ respective forms served to “knock out” both provisions. Accordingly, we shall determine whether the trial court erred in interpreting section 2207 to conclude that Tippins’s arbitration provision was, indeed, “knocked out” and that the contract the parties formed did not compel arbitration.</p>

It would be inequitable to lend greater force to one party’s preferred terms than the other’s. As one court recently explained, “An approach other than the knock-out rule for conflicting terms would result in ... [ ] any offeror ...
