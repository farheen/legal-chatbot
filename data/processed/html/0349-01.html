The warning letter notified Philadelphia Honda that the infractions constituted a first offense. By official notice dated March 21,1994, DOT notified Philadelphia Honda that, following a hearing held February 15, 1994, it was imposing 30 separate $100.00 sanctions pursuant to 75 Pa. C.S. § 1374(d)(1), as a result of Philadelphia Honda’s failure to submit properly assigned certificates of title in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1103.1(d)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>1374(a)(5).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Philadelphia Honda appealed the imposition of monetary sanctions to the trial court.</p>

Philadelphia Honda presented the testimony of their comptroller, Patricia D. Humphrey (Humphrey), who testified that during the period in which the thirty violations occurred a total of 972 cars were sold by Philadelphia Honda.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Humphrey also testified that each dealership in the area has one title clerk. In an order dated May 31, 1994, the trial court granted Philadelphia Honda’s appeal and rescinded the monetary sanctions imposed by DOT, reasoning that sanctions were inappropriate here because the late applications comprised only five percent of all the applications that Philadelphia Honda submitted. DOT appeals.</p>

Initially, DOT argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it considered Philadelphia Honda’s percentage of untimely title submissions as a “relevant mitigating event” under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1374. Second, DOT asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it utilized this as a mitigating circumstance to totally relieve Philadelphia Honda from all liability for the thirty admitted violations. Finally, DOT argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it applied a <em>de minimis </em>rule to Philadelphia Honda’s thirty violations.</p>

In its brief, Philadelphia Honda admits to violating this section on the thirty occasions in question. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1374 empowers DOT with discretion to impose a monetary penalty or suspend or revoke registration plates where such a violation occurs. Section 1374, however, requires DOT to consider “relevant mitigating events” when conducting hearings for such violations. “Where the language of a statute is clear, we must read the statute’s provisions in accordance with their plain meaning and ordinary usage.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a); <em>Commonwealth, Department of </em>

    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[211,373,755,1389]]]'>Here, we find that the phrase “relevant mitigating event” has a clear meaning. Black’s Law Dictionary defines “mitigation” as “[a]lleviation, reduction, abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment imposed by law.” Black’s Law Dictionary 904 (5th ed. 1979). “Event” is defined as “[t]he consequence of anything; the issue or outcome of an action as finally determined; that in which an action, operation, or series of operations, terminates. Noteworthy happening or occurrence. Something that happens.” Black’s Law Dictionary 498 (5th ed. 1979). The fact that the number of Philadelphia Honda’s late title submissions is small in comparison to the total number of cars sold cannot be considered an “event” and therefore cannot be mitigating. We agree with DOT’s assertion that a “relevant mitigating event” is something that is beyond the control of the motor vehicle dealer, that is significant and of such a nature that it moderates and lessens the consequences of the late title submissions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> As a result, we find that Philadelphia Honda failed to offer any “relevant mitigating event” which would serve to lessen the penalty imposed and DOT did not err when it imposed thirty separate $100.00 sanctions for each violation.</p>
