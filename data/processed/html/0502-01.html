Baio was paid compensation by Commercial Union Insurance Co. (plaintiff), the carrier for his employer, Frank Robino, Inc. Baio filed an action in the Superior Court under 19 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2363<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> against DiSabatino Brothers, Inc., and Rankin Development Company, who were alleged to have been responsible for his injuries. Commercial Union (by its attorney) joined as a plaintiff in that action against DiSabatino and Rankin. In so doing, the carrier aligned itself with Baio, against the alleged tort feasors, to recover some $8,200 in compensation which it had paid to Baio or for his benefit. Commercial Union, of course, had a right to so sue (in subrogation) under § 2363. <em>Cannon v. Container Corporation of America, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/282/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="282 A.2d 614" data-case-ids="8075898" data-case-paths="/a2d/282/0614-01">282 A.2d 614</a>(1971).</p>

But Baio was seeking a judgment of about $350,000 from DiSabatino and Rankin, and Commercial Union was obliged to defend that tort action for Rankin. Clearly, the Insurance Company had a conflict of interest on its hands — it was on both sides of the lawsuit.</p>
    <p id="b552-12" data-blocks='[["BL_552.15",552,[1006,990,745,323]]]'>Understandably, Commercial Union concluded that there was a greater financial risk under its contract with Rankin, so it resolved the conflict by switching sides, that is, from plaintiff to defendant. In so doing, of course, it went to Rankin’s defense in opposition to Baio.</p>

Baio’s witnesses were examined and cross-examined, arguments were made in opposition to him. And a statement taken by Commercial Union from Baio as the compensation carrier for Frank Robino, Inc. was used during the trial for the benefit of Rankin and DiSaba-tino in an attempt to deny any recovery to Baio. In all of this, Commercial Union was successful: the Superior Court directed a verdict for its insured, Rankin, and thus denied (as a matter of law) Baio’s claim against it. Baio ended with a judgment, not for the $350,000 he sought from Rankin <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>and DiSabatino, but in the amount of $175,-000 against DiSabatino Brothers alone.</p>

The Court granted summary judgment for Commercial Union and against Baio, who then docketed this appeal.</p>

Of course, Commercial Union has a statutory right to reimbursement of the compensation payments it made on Baio’s account. There is no question about that. The issue centers, rather, on whether Commercial Union, by its conduct, after switching sides, waived the right given it by the Statute. In arguing that it did not, Commercial Union draws on the mandatory language of § 2363(e), that is, an injured worker “shall” reimburse the insurance carrier. But we do not read that as a command to an injured workman (covered by the Compensation Act) to repay an insurance company no matter what the facts nor how unfair its conduct may have been. It is, we think, unreasonable to assume that the General Assembly intended to permit such an . unnatural result.</p>

Both the statutes and the practice vary widely. See the comprehensive review in 2A Larson’s <em>Workmen’s Compensation Law </em>§ 74.10, et seq. That respected authority emphasizes that there should be a statutory incentive “particularly to strive for the fullest possible damage recovery” against a third party tort feasor, and that “particularly applies to the carrier which has at stake only the amount of its compensation outlay.” And the writer notes how difficult that is when the carrier has a direct conflict of interest; thus: .</p>

      <em>Arendas </em>is much like the case before us. There a deceased workman’s employer and his insurance carrier sought to share in the estate’s recovery from the tort feasor.

The Court stated that the pertinent question was this:</p>

Neither is there any indication in the entire record that there was any aid or free cooperation given on the part of the third-party defendant to the plaintiff.

An insurance company, of course, may have issued two or more policies to insureds who become adversaries in litigation. Given the wide spread use of insurance, such conflicts are inevitable. Nothing in this opinion requires that the carrier “waive” any right of subrogation which it may have under either or both policies. To comply with a contract obligation to one party (to defend him, for example,) the company is not obligated to give up or forego a right of subrogation (whether statutory or otherwise). We hold only that if an insurance company, which is in such a situation, expects to get an advantage or benefit from the litigation of a party whom it elects to oppose in that litigation, it must act equitably toward him. Equitable conduct might include, for example, the maintenance of separate files, the employment of separate counsel, submitting itself to the judgment of the Court, and so on; but it is impractical, and unnecessary, to attempt to catalogue in this case what an insurance company might do to protect itself, in the legal sense, no matter what the result of the lawsuit.

If there is an “increasing prevalence of direct conflicts on interest” causing a carrier “to turn up on both sides of the courtroom”, as I suspect (without evidence here) there is, then there may be a policy problem in this highly regulated industry worthy of a uniform statutory policy remedy. But there is now clearly no State policy prohibiting insurance <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>companies from insuring both risks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Nothing in this record would justify us in expressing an opinion on the wisdom of a prohibitory policy. We know nothing about the insurance industry from a business or social point of view. The proposition that an insurance company must “waive” its subrogation rights under the workmen’s compensation statute in order to honor its obligation as a liability carrier is patently unfair and contrary to any existing statutory policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> The point should be that any remedy required as a result of “increasing prevalence of direct conflicts” is one of policy better considered in the legislative arena on proper social, business and insurance data with a consciousness of the need for coverage. It must be borne in mind that these conflicts arise by the chance of coverage by a specific insurer after the accident and frequently, as here, are not discovered until the claimant’s suit against a third party.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> In short, there may be a problem worthy of attention. But the existence of a problem should not be an invitation to this Court on a case by case basis to bar an insurer litigant of its workmen’s compénsation subrogation right in disregard of the statute.

Indeed, <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>no real argument has been made to the contrary.

I am not sure of the significance of the footnote in the majority opinion disclaiming any concern here with the ethical conduct of Commercial Union’s attorney. While I recognize questions of ethical conduct of Commercial Union’s attorney and the legal conflict faced by Commercial Union itself are separate issues, and while technically no question of ethics is before us, I find it difficult to treat this letter and any Baio waiver resulting therefrom as dealing solely with representation. It expressly speaks of the “inherent conflict of interest” of a carrier, “the fact that my client’s lien is preserved” and “[t]he lien interest of my client” resting on the plaintiff’s case. Obviously, Commercial Union’s attorney thought he was dealing with his client’s conflict as well as his own. And surely Commercial Union will look to its attorney for guidance as to its own conflict. While it is almost always possible to do better in retrospect, Mr. Redfeam’s conduct was open and above board and expressly extended to Commercial Union.</p>

It should be noted that Rankin’s insurance coverage has significance to a claimant as well as to Rankin, and the Baios, in particular, had a stake during the litigation in that coverage. They just lost a fair fight on their claim against Rankin.</p>

But workmen’s compensation recoveries can be enormous and even the “equitable” law of this case will be hard to reasonably distinguish in the cases that follow. Moreover, under the general policy view I have expressed, the deci-sión clearly allows the “double recovery” noted by the majority. I fear the majority is creating a new field for future litigation that is unnecessary given the statute, unwarranted by statutory policy, and undesirable for legal certainty in a regulated industry assigned the social and economic responsibility of dealing with particular risks. The final footnote in the majority opinion may provide a meaningful limitation on the broader language in the body of the opinion and give insurers some guidance when conflict situations arise.</p>

I use the broad language of estoppel because, as I understand it, waiver, whether express or implied, is the “intentional relinquishment of a known right.” See, for example, <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ponsell’s Drug Stores, Inc., </em>Del. Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%20271" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="202 A.2d 271">202 A.2d 271</a>, 274 (1964) and <em>Klein v.

In my judgment, it is clear that Commercial Union did not intentionally relinquish its right to subrogation. To the contrary, Commercial Union expressly reserved its subrogation claim in the letter of July 31, 1974 at the very commencement of the lawsuit.</p>

While we have no evidence of insurance company practice, and perhaps a judgment is premature, it does clearly seem to me that the defendants here are correct when they say: “Recognizing the conflict that was created, Commercial should have established separate files and retained separate attorneys for both their interests as the workmen’s compensation carrier and as the liability carrier. Information received in its capacity as the workmen’s compensation carrier should not have been used by it in its capacity as the liability carrier. 19 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2312.”</p>
