Prior to the <em>Morgan </em>decision, the United States Supreme Court had not imposed a mandatory requirement that a defendant be afforded a life qualifying voir dire question upon request. Additionally, prior to <em>Morgan, </em>Pennsylvania did not mandate that juries be questioned on life qualification. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Therefore, under the test enunciated in <em>Teague, </em>the holding of <em>Morgan </em>announced a new rule and placed a new obligation on the states. A new rule of law to which we give full- retroactive effect, will not be applied to any case on collateral review unless that decision was handed down during the pendency of an appellant’s direct appeal and the issue was properly preserved there, or, is non-waivable. <em>Commonwealth v.

The evidence at trial established that on September 9, 1983, at approximately 12:00 a.m., appellant was driving in his automobile along with his girlfriend and two other companions. Appellant noticed the victim, Dalton Charles Smithburger Jr., hitchhiking and decided to pick him up in order to rob him. Appellant asked the victim if he had any money to contribute for gas. The victim replied that he had only a couple of dollars. Dissatisfied with this response, appellant pulled out his revolver, held it to the victim's head and ordered him to place his hands on the dashboard and shut his eyes. The victim complied with appellant’s orders. Shortly thereafter, . appellant pulled his vehicle off the road at an isolated spot, led the victim into a field and searched him, finding only thirteen dollars. Appellant ordered the victim to lie face down on the ground while he returned to the car to inform his companions that he was going to kill the victim.

In addition, the trial judge, during an extensive colloquy with appellant in the sentencing phase, explained that if the jury found that the murder was committed during the commission of a robbery, this would be an aggravating circumstance, and if there were no mitigating circumstances, the jury would be obligated to impose the death penalty. The trial judge further explained that the decision not to offer mitigating evidence would not effect appellant's overall right to appeal the conviction and sentence; however, the court specifically instructed appellant that he could not later appeal his decision not to offer mitigating evidence.</p>

The record reveals that an investigator from the Public Defender’s Office assisted trial counsel in preparing for appellant’s trial. Counsel reviewed all discovery materials available in appellant’s case and interviewed appellant extensively. Trial counsel also interviewed appellant's mother father, and sister, and extensively reviewed the list of mitigating circumstances allowable under the law with appellant and his family to determine if any such circumstances applied to his case. Neither appellant nor his family members apprised counsel that appellant had any problems with drugs or alcohol. Moreover, counsel had appellant examined and evaluated for mental health purposes at Mayview State Hospital. This evaluation showed no signs of any mental illness. This type of preparation can hardly be deemed a failure of trial counsel to adequately investigate the existence of mitigating circumstances.</p>
