The Project provided for the construction of approximately 3.375 miles of highway, reconstruction and rehabilitation of local roads and construction of bridge structures and retaining walls. DOT issued a notice to proceed on April 10, 1987 and set a completion date of December 17, 1988. After the work began, multiple problems arose which delayed Durkin’s performance and prevented completion of the Project within the specified time. To resolve Dur-kin’s potential contract claims against DOT, to provide an additional year for performance and to provide compensation to Durkin for work completed during the additional year, the parties executed an interim settlement agreement dated November 10,1988 (Agreement). The Agreement provided a $2.25 million lump-sum payment to resolve Durkin’s claims; provided smaller lump-sum payments for specified construction tasks; provided for the construction of two retaining walls on a force account basis; and provided revised unit prices for certain contract items.</p>

On December 15, 1992, Durkin forwarded a letter to DOT identifying thirteen claims requiring additional compensation. A resolution could not be reached, and on June 16, 1993, Durkin filed a complaint with the Board. On March 4, 1999, the Board issued an order that awarded Durkin $416,208.73 of the $1,534,075.48 claimed. Of the thirteen claims heard by the Board (Claims A-M), only Durkin’s appeal of the Board’s order as to Claims C and J and DOT’s appeal as to Claim G are before the Court.</p>
    <p id="b281-10" data-blocks='[["BL_281.8",281,[1010,764,756,781]]]'>Claim C involved DOT’s refusal to pay Durkin force account, equipment standby costs of $140,314.61 incurred when Durkin chose not to work, i.e., rain days, weekends and holidays. In refusing payment, DOT relied on its Project Office Manual, an internal publication pertaining to the administration of highway contracts, which specifies: “[D]ay[s] on which the contractor elects not to work, standby time will not be paid.” Durkin argued that the manual was never made part of the contract. The Board found that the manual was “in effect” during the Project and awarded Durkin $25,662.40 of the $140,-314.61 claimed.</p>

DOT states that the barrier was used to separate roadway traffic from the construction work and that the attenuators were used to guard traffic from collisions with objects such as guardrails. Durkin argued that DOT was required to pay the revised unit prices for the temporary concrete barrier at $15.25 per linear foot (for 29,153 linear feet) and for the temporary impact attenuators at $15,750 per unit (for 12 units) as specified in paragraph 5C of the Agreement. DOT argued that payment was covered by paragraph 5B of the Agreement, which provided a $150,000 lump-sum payment for the “extended maintenance and protection of traffic.” The Board determined that paragraph 5B <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>governed, and it denied Durkin any other sums for these items over and above the $150,000 lump-sum payment.</p>

The contract required Durkin to construct a combination proprietary and tieback retaining wall at Ramp B.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> DOT’s design plans noted the precise location of the interface point between the proprietary and retaining portions of the wall. DOT’s Ramp B drawings, however, noted the interface point as “approximate” and stated that it would be determined “after the rock surface is exposed during construction.” Actual field conditions revealed that the interface point varied from what the design plans indicated. To construct the wall as required, Durkin incurred additional expense in removing significant quantities of rock. DOT’s stated position was that removal of the rock was covered by the contract because the interface point was labeled on the Ramp B drawings as “approximate.” By contrast Durkin maintained that the work was unanticipated and outside the scope of the contract. The Board agreed with Durkin and concluded that the work was beyond the scope of the contract and warranted additional compensation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Durkin contends that the Board erred by failing to award Durkin costs for temporary concrete barrier and temporary impact attenuators already on site when the Agreement was executed. Durkin explained that these “time-related items” are not permanently incorporated into a project but instead are rented for use during the period of a project, and the extension of the contract with DOT for another year increased Durkin’s costs for retaining these items at the site. Durkin urges the Court to consider another essential factor overlooked by the Board, i.e., that the equipment represented contract items which were separate and apart from the general contract item for maintenance and protection of traffic, and pursuant to paragraph 5C of the Agreement DOT was liable for these items separately. Thus, Dur-kin contends, the parties intended that the revised unit prices would be paid for this equipment to compensate Durkin for its rental value for the extended period of the contract.</p>

Instead, Durkin maintains that payment is governed solely by paragraph 5C of the Agreement, which provides that “items listed on Exhibit ‘B’ shall be paid to Durkin for the prices set forth therein. Any items not listed in Exhibit ‘B’, paragraphs 5A and B of this Agreement ... shall be paid for at the original unit price.” DOT responds that the revised prices fist-ed in Exhibit “B” apply only to barrier and attenuators brought onto the project after the execution of the Agreement; that use <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>of the equipment prior to extension of the contract was paid for under the original contract; and that use of the equipment during the extended period was covered by the $150,000 lump-sum payment under paragraph 5B.</p>

Here, the Board found that the temporary concrete barrier and temporary impact attenuators already on site fell outside of the definition in Exhibit “B” for Contract Item No. 2901-0010 and Item No. 0627-0001. Exhibit “B” gives prices for “providing, installing, maintaining, and removing” barrier and attenuators, and Durkin sought payment for material that had already been provided and installed and whose removal had already been paid for by DOT. Board Decision, p. 16. The Board found as well that Durkin did not communicate prior to signing the Agreement with its subcontractor, who provided the temporary concrete barrier, to determine what additional costs might be due; the Board also found that the equipment was a part of the maintenance and protection of traffic plans and was used throughout the Project. The Board thus concluded that the revised unit prices applied only to barrier and attenuators brought on site after execution of the Agreement and that the $150,000 lump-sum payment specified in paragraph 5B for extended maintenance and protection of traffic plans fully compensated Durkin for its Claim J. The Court concludes that the Board’s Claim J findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and therefore may not be disturbed.</p>

Durkin argues that the document represents a DOT internal operating manual which was not made part of the contract. Durkin states that compensation for equipment standby time is governed solely by Section 110.03(d)(3) of DOT Publication No. 408-83, a document specifically incorporated into the contract. Section 110.03(d)(3) provides: “If machinery or equipment is required at the work site, but is not operating, compensation will be at the hourly rental rate, exclusive of operating costs.”</p>

The Court reiterated the principle that a contract is not ambiguous if its meaning can be ascertained without “any guide other than a knowledge of the simple facts on which, from the nature of language in general, its meaning depends; and a contract is not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties do not agree upon the proper construction.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=452%20A.2d%20105" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="452 A.2d 105">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=452%20A.2d%20105" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="452 A.2d 105">at 106</a>.

Moreover, DOT’s assistant district construction engineer, Andrew Stasek, testified that the manual was just a guideline and was “not carved in stone.” (R.R. at p. 76a). Because the equipment standby contract terms were clear and can be interpreted without any other guide, the Court concludes that the Board erred in considering DOT’s manual in arriving at the amount of standby costs payable by DOT. The Board was restricted to considering only the terms of the Agreement. Because the Board erred in relying on matters outside of the contract to interpret the parties’ intention, <em>see Banks, </em>its order as to Claim C is vacated.

Super. 101" data-case-ids="740652" data-case-paths="/pa-super/186/0101-01">186 Pa.Super. 101</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.2d%20358" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="140 A.2d 358">140 A.2d 358</a> (1958), for the proposition that a plaintiff may recover only those damages that could not, with reasonable effort, be avoided. The Board's findings show that Durkin did not fail to mitigate damages, but it instead constructed the wall consistent with DOT’s specifications. Also, DOT refused to direct Durkin to implement an alternate method of construction. These findings refute DOT’s failure-to-mitigate claim.</p>
