Crawford appeals from an order of the Superior Court denying his petition for return of property that was seized by police in an investigation that led to his June 1, 2001 plea of guilty to one count of third degree rape and two counts of sexual exploitation of a child. Crawford was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment (suspended after 9 years for decreasing levels of supervision) on September 26, 2001. After the Superior Court denied his motion for a reduction of sentence, that sentence was affirmed by this Court on March 25, 2003.</p>

The motion was referred to a Superior Court Commissioner for findings of fact and recommendations. The State filed a response to Crawford’s motion on December 9, 2002, in which the State opposed the return of the property. The Commissioner recommended that the property be forfeited, and the Superior Court adopted the Commissioner’s recommendation.</p>

Additionally, the State argues, its December 9, 2002 response to Crawford’s motion for return of property operated as a timely petition for forfeiture under 10 <em>Del.

That statute requires that an action for forfeiture upon a penal statute must be filed within one year “from the accruing of the cause of action.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The <em>amicus </em>urges that the State’s claim is time-barred under Section 8115, because Crawford’s cause of action “accrued” on the date of his guilty plea, June 1, 2001 — more than one year before the State responded to Crawford’s petition for return of property. The <em>amicus </em>also contends that even if the State’s response was timely under Section 8115, the 20-day-before-trial filing requirement of Criminal Rule 40 “trumps” 10 <em>Del.

C. </em>§ 2311(a)(2) independently empower the Superior Court to dispose of property seized from individuals convicted of crimes, and if so, is that power subject to the defendant’s Due Process right to a jury trial?</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[175,1157,753,857]]]'>Forfeiture proceedings that are civil in nature are governed by the one-year statute of limitations found at 10 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 8115. Also applicable to forfeiture proceedings is Criminal Rule 40(a), which requires that in a criminal proceeding, the State “shall” file a motion for forfeiture no later than 20 days before the trial of the criminal offense. Crawford, and the <em>ami-cus </em>claim that because the State failed to file a timely motion for forfeiture in his criminal case, the State forever waived its right to forfeiture, because 11 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 5122 provides that any inconsistency between the Delaware Code and the Rules of Criminal Procedure must be resolved in favor of the Rules.</p>
    <p id="b675-6" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[177,2047,750,194]],["BL_675.6",675,[972,266,754,906]]]'>The difficulty with that argument is that 11 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 5121, the statute that empowers the Superior Court to adopt procedural rules, also provides that “[s]uch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify the substantive rights of any person.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> “Any person” would presumably include jural persons such as the State. Arguably, therefore, the 20 days-before-trial filing requirement of Rule 40 cannot be jurisdictional. If it were, then Rule 40 (a procedural rule) would severely abridge the State’s statutory (substantive) right under Section 8115 to file a forfeiture proceeding within one year of the accruing of the cause of action. Moreover (as the State points out), by pleading guilty long before the scheduled criminal trial date, a defendant could preclude the State from filing a forfeiture motion before its right to do so under Rule 40 has expired.</p>
    <p id="b675-10" data-blocks='[["BL_675.11",675,[972,1237,756,785]]]'>How the inconsistency between Rule 40 and Section 8115 should be resolved, is an issue that need not be decided in this case, however. In all events, and at the latest, under Section 8115 the State was required to seek forfeiture within one year from the accrual of its cause of action. We have previously determined that a cause of action under Section 8115 “ac~ cruefs]” on the date of the defendant’s sentencing. Because the State did not file an action for forfeiture within one year from Crawford’s sentencing, the State waived its entitlement to seek forfeiture in all events.</p>

We hold that it does. Section 8115 refers to “... the suit of the party aggrieved, ... or of the State, or otherwise”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> to one year after the “accrual” of the cause of action. Thus, the one-year time bar applies to both the State and the party whose property has been seized. This Court has held that a defendant’s petition for return of property, if filed more than one year from the defendant’s sentencing, is time-barred and must be dismissed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Crawford’s petition for return of property is not time-barred, however, because Crawford was sentenced on <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>September 26, 2001, and he filed his petition for the return of property on August 2, 2002.

Assuming without deciding that filing an answer that contains an objection to a petition for return of property was a procedurally proper way for the State affirmatively to seek a forfeiture, the State’s answer was not filed until December 9, 2002 — more than one year after Crawford had been sentenced. Thus, under any scenario the State’s forfeiture claim is time-barred.</p>

C. </em>§ .2311(a)(2). That statute provides that property of one “duly convicted of the alleged crime... shall be disposed of as the court directs.” Crawford and the <em>amicus </em>respond that even under that construction of Section 2311, Crawford is entitled to a jury trial on his petition for return of property. Crawford is correct: in <em>State v. Rossitto, </em>this Court determined that a defendant is entitled to the due process safeguards of a jury trial in a proceeding to determine forfeiture under Section 2311(a)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>
