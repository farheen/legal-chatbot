After the police executed three controlled buys of cocaine over several weeks, they procured a search warrant for Defendant’s home and executed the warrant. Defendant was present at the time the police executed the warrant and the police arrested him. The police gave Defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked him if he understood those rights, to which Defendant answered in the affirmative. Defendant then proceeded to answer the officer’s questions, and more particularly, he indicated the location of a gun. Importantly, the police did not ask him if he was willing to give up his rights or whether he was willing to waive those rights prior to questioning him. Subsequently, while the police were transporting Defendant, he made a statement regarding his owning the gun for protection.</p>

        <em>. </em>The admissibility of the second statement implicates the issue of whether the <em>Miranda </em>warnings remained effective at the time Defendant made the second statement in the police car later that day. Although the trial court did not address this issue, we note that the issue of when renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required was discussed by our Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/561/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="561 Pa. 617" data-case-ids="93826" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0617-01">561 Pa. 617</a>, <a href="/a2d/752/0871-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="752 A.2d 871" data-case-ids="11511906,93826" data-case-paths="/a2d/752/0871-01,/pa/561/0617-01">752 A.2d 871</a>, 875-76 (2000) (listing factors to be considered). The question is whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the initial warnings have become stale or too remote to remain effective. We conclude that the officer was not required to give renewed warnings in the instant case. Our conclusion is based on the following factors: the short amount of time between the warnings and the statement in the car; the fact that it was the same officer in both instances; and the subsequent statement involved relatively the same subject matter as the previous statement. In addition, it was Defendant who initiated the conversation, and his response to the officer’s <a id="p1287" href="#p1287" data-label="1287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1287</a>subsequent questions was hardly incriminating, as he simply stated that he had the gun for protection.</p>
