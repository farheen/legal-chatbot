Through its trade name Best Healthcare of Western Pennsylvania, UPMC also provides health insurance benefits to participants in Pennsylvania’s Medicaid program. Appellees are part of a network of pharmacies which operate under agreements<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">2</a> with UPMC to provide pharmaceutical services to UPMC’s subscribers and their employees. The Agreement provides for the reimbursement of costs for prescription drugs provided to UPMC’s subscribers and their employees in accordance with specific brand name and generic drug pricing methodologies. The participating pharmacies are required to submit claims for reimbursement via telecommunication within 72 hours of dispensing a prescription, and to accept by telecommunication information in response to the claim from a claims processor.</p>

However, a group of 103 pharmacies, the Appellees herein, refused to return their portion of the overpayments, which amounted to approximately $1.8 million, and filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that UPMC had no contractual, legal, or equitable basis to recover the overpayments. UPMC filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that it was, in fact, entitled to recover the over-payments. The trial court ruled in favor of Appellees, concluding that under the Agreement, UPMC has no right to recover any of the overpayments. This appeal followed, wherein UPMC presents the following issues for our review:</p>

Alternatively, since the trial court concluded that the Agreement is silent as to [UPMC’s] ability to recover the overpayments at issue in this case, did the trial court err as a matter of law in holding that [UPMC] may not recover the over-payments in restitution based [on] a unilateral mistake in the performance of the Agreement wheré it is undisputed an error in [UPMC’s] pharmacy claims processing system caused the Pharmacies to be reimbursed for generic prescriptions at brand rates resulting in the Pharmacies receiving $1.8 million more in reimbursements than they were entitled to receive under the Agreement?</blockquote>

Contrary to the trial court’s assertion, nowhere does the Agreement allow the participating pharmacy to “immediately accept the price offered or ... negotiate a different price with Argus until a price was reached which Plaintiffs accepted.” <em>(Id.) </em>Although under the Agreement, a participating pharmacy is not required to “render any pharmaceutical service and/or to dispense any prescription medication if, in the dispensing pharmacist’s professional judgement such service should not be rendered and/or such medication should not be dispensed,” (Agreement, Paragraph 3), we find no basis to conclude that such discretion extends to pricing issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">5</a> Thus, we cannot <a id="p982" href="#p982" data-label="982" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*982</a>agree with the trial court that the price for each individual prescription was an open element under the Agreement, and we find no basis for concluding that a separate mini-contract was created for each prescription.</p>

If it was intended, as the trial court suggests, that UPMC’s recovery of payments would only be justified based on an audit of a pharmacy’s books, records, invoices and prescription files, the language of the first and second sentences would have been consistent, i.e., the first sentence would have contained the term “audit.” Moreover, the first sentence of paragraph 1(L) provides UPMC access to the participating pharmacy’s books, records, invoices, and files <em>deemed necessary </em>for UPMC to verify claim information. We find no basis to conclude that the fact that such access was not, in fact, necessary in order for UPMC to discover the pricing error precludes recovery of payments pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph 1(L).

As a result of a conflict of interest which arose due to the purchase, UPMC hired Argus as its new PBM. It is undisputed, however, that Argus was instructed to continue the same pricing methodology for generic drugs as was utilized by ProVantage, and that none of the pharmacies expected that the pricing methodology would change when Argus became UPMC's PBM.</p>

We note that in their brief, Appellees argue that a “Final Claims Processing Report”, which was prepared for UPMC by an internal auditor of UPMC after the pricing errors occurred, but before litigation in this case commenced, “for the purpose of reflecting management consensus on a variety of issues pertaining to the pharmacy claims,” (Appel-lees’ Brief at 28), supports a finding that Appellees had discretion to refuse to provide services to plan participants if they deemed the reimbursement amounts proposed by Ar<a id="p982" href="#p982" data-label="982" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*982</a>gus to be inadequate. Specifically, Appellees rely on the following language:</p>
      <blockquote id="b1026-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1026.2",1026,[285,2361,686,323]]]'>The adjudication process is performed in an on line system in real time. The pharmacist enters the prescription information and submits it to Argus. Once transmitted it is subjected to 150-200 claim edits in the Argus system ... If all edits are passed the pharmacist[] is returned a reimbursement amount along with copayment information.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b1026-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1026.3",1026,[1087,2272,683,238]]]'>At this point the pharmacist can either accept the price presented and complete the transaction, or elect not to fill the prescription if the pharmacist feels the reimbursement amount is not comparable with cost.</blockquote>

        <em>{Id. </em>at 28.) The Final Claims Report, however, was <em>not part </em>of the Agreement between UPMC and Appellees, and does not operate to change the terms thereafter.</p>
