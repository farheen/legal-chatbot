Gauvin to represent her in further proceedings before the Superior Court in this matter. The petition has been submitted to this Court on plaintiffs behalf by a member of the Rhode Island Bar who practices in a Fall River, Massachusetts law firm. Since Article II, Rule 9 of this Courtâ€™s rules places a number of responsibilities on the sponsoring Rhode Island attorney in cases involving <em>pro hac vice </em>counsel, we are of the opinion that the sponsoring Rhode Island attorney must be one who practices law out of a Rhode Island office.</p>
