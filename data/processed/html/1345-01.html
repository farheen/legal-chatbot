C. </em>§ 4753A) and Possession of Cocaine (16 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4754), the lesser included offense of the charge of Possession with Intent to Deliver Cocaine (16 <em>DeLC. </em>§ 4751). <em>See </em>16 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4762. Defendant was sentenced to a term of five years’ incarceration on the trafficking conviction, of which the first three years were mandatory. Defendant was also fined $50,000, which was suspended, and given a suspended sentence of one year’s incarceration on the possession charge. Defendant’s appeal raises four issues: (1) whether the detention and search of the defendant and subsequent seizure of evidence violated defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights; (2) whether the trial court’s instructions adequately explained to the jury the elements of the offense of trafficking in cocaine; (3) whether there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions; and (4) whether the State’s repeated oblique references to defendant’s failure to testify constituted plain error, in violation of defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. We find no merit in the first three issues raised by defendant on appeal. However, we find that the prosecutor’s remarks constituted impermissible comments on defendant’s election not to testify, and further that such remarks amount to plain error. Accordingly, we reverse defendant’s convictions and remand the case for a new trial.</p>

Officer Michael Maggitti observed defendant Robertson sitting in the driver’s seat of a Cadillac Eldorado, a “very nice looking car,” with a male passenger in the front seat and a third male standing by the partially opened door on the driver’s side. Officer Maggitti stopped his cruiser in front of the Cadillac with the intention of telling the occupants to turn the car radio down. As he approached on foot the music subsided, but the officer continued on — his suspicions aroused by the combination of the youthful appearance of the driver and make of the car.</p>

When Maggitti asked the name of his brother, Robertson <a id="p1349" href="#p1349" data-label="1349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1349</a>replied that the car was not in his brother’s name. Maggitti then ordered Robertson out of the car and frisked him for weapons. At some point, a second police car arrived with patrolmen Brown and Butler. Patrolman Brown had already taken custody of the young man standing at the side of the vehicle, and Patrolman Butler came forward to take charge of the defendant. As Butler approached, he noticed a brown paper bag on the ground under the Cadillac, lying four to six inches in from the driver’s side. As Maggitti retrieved the bag, Robertson exclaimed that the bag was not his. The bag contained U.S. currency and foil wrapped packets, typical of illegal drug packaging. Robertson was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. More cash was found in a voluntary search of the car ($90) and on Robertson’s person. The paper bag contained $20 cash and 6.01 grams of cocaine.</p>

The State further suggests: (1) that the officer had a legitimate reason to approach the car, based on the noise violation; (2) that defendant’s contradictory statements of the car’s ownership reasonably aroused Officer Maggitti’s suspicion that the car might be stolen; and (3) that the officer had reason to detain the defendant based on the defendant’s response, his age, the type of car and the fact that the police had been receiving complaints of crime in the area. The State argues that these facts justified a brief Terry-type detention to determine the status of the vehicle. Therefore, the police were properly proceeding with an investigatory stop when the bag containing drugs appeared in plain view. Alternatively, the State contends that Robertson did not have standing to challenge the search and seizure, or that Robertson’s Fourth Amendment rights were not implicated, even if he did have standing, because society does not recognize a privacy interest in “street trash.” Finally, the State contends the search of the car was justified pursuant to defendant’s arrest for drug trafficking.</p>

There’s no evidence that came from the witness stand that those drugs came from [the other men present at the scene].” In our view, the prosecutor’s remarks were both negative and uninvited. At the very least, the State implied that the defendant could have either denied any knowledge of the bag’s existence or rebutted the trafficking charge by testifying that the cocaine was for his personal use rather than inventory for sale. The repetitive nature of the comments also precludes finding them to be a casual comment on the defendant’s decision not to take the witness stand. Under the circumstances, the repeated references to the evidence being “undisputed from the witness stand” could only suggest to the jury that an inference of defendant’s guilt should be drawn through his failure to testify.
