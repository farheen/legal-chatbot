    <p id="b964-24" data-blocks='[["BL_964.22",964,[1006,1506,754,1022]]]'>This appeal arises from a dismissal by the Board of Real Property Assessments and Appeals (formerly known as the Board of Equalization and Review) (Board) of appellant Ulysses G. Auger’s petitions challenging the Board’s property tax assessments because the petitions were incomplete. After Auger’s petitions were dismissed, he filed a complaint seeking judicial review of the property tax assessments in the Superior Court. The trial court dismissed Auger’s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that he had failed to exhaust all possible administrative remedies. The central issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in dismissing Auger’s complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We reverse and remand.</p>

At the hearing, representatives of the District of Columbia Tax Assessor’s Office requested dismissal of the appeals on the ground that the petitions were incomplete. Counsel for the Auger interests, acknowledged that he had mistakenly filed an incomplete set of documents with the Board for the 1994 fiscal year due to an oversight on his part. Because the filings were incomplete, the Board orally dismissed the petitions at the hearing, citing 9 DCMR §§ 2009.4, 2009.5, and 2009.6 (1987). The Board memorialized the dismissals in written orders on the same date.</p>

Auger further contends that the Board’s dismissal of the petitions for incomplete documentation was a final decision on the merits of the case, and that he was not required to request a rehearing under the Board’s regulations. Thus, judicial review by the Superior Court was appropriate. Finally, Auger argues that even if a rehearing request was required, the Board waived any rehearing requirement by sending Auger notice that its decision was final and that he had the right to appeal from this adverse decision of the Board to the Superior Court. Therefore, Auger argues that he exhausted his administrative remedies and that the Superior Court erred in dismissing his appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

Further, the District submits that such a dismissal was administrative rather than a final adjudication on the merits, and therefore, the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. Finally, the District argues that Auger, in addition to failing to request an opportunity to submit the necessary documentation to complete his petitions, also failed to request a rehearing by the Board pursuant to 9 DCMR §§ 2020.2 and 2020.3 (1987), after the petitions were dismissed, thus failing to exhaust his administrative remedies pri- or to filing suit in the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b966-4" data-blocks='[["BL_966.4",966,[205,1120,754,640]]]'>Despite the parties’ focus on the issue of jurisdiction based on a question of whether Auger had exhausted his administrative remedies, we believe the central question before the court in this case is whether the Board had the authority under 9 DCMR § 2009.9 of its regulations to dismiss Auger’s petitions in the first instance, merely because they were incomplete, without prescribing a time period or otherwise allowing Auger the opportunity to supplement his petitions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Specifically, 9 DCMR § 2009.9 provides that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b966-5" data-blocks='[["BL_966.5",966,[245,1776,715,440]]]'>The Board may, in its discretion, dismiss any petition which it deems incomplete or which has otherwise failed to comply with the rules; Provided, that the Board shall notify the petitioner(s) in what respect the petition is incomplete and shall allow the petitioner(s) to submit the necessary information within a prescribed time period.</blockquote>

However, the District argues that because Auger was represented by experienced counsel who is presumed to be familiar with the Board’s regulations, counsel’s failure to request leave to supplement his filing excuses the Board from its obligation to be in strict compliance with its own regulations. The District argues that this is especially true where as here the petitioner has the burden of establishing that his administrative remedies have been exhausted before filing suit in Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b966-9" data-blocks='[["BL_966.10",966,[1006,842,755,1684]]]'>However, despite the District’s argument, we have consistently held that “[a]n agency is bound to follow its own regulations.” <em>Abdullah v.

In this case, because the District of Columbia concedes that the Board did not comply with its regulations when it failed to set a specific time for . submission of the missing documents, and-because the regulations do not allow the Board to dismiss a petition until the petitioner is given an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in the original fifing, we find the District’s argument that the burden rests on petitioner to be unavailing.</p>
    <p id="b967-3" data-blocks='[["BL_967.3",967,[153,240,757,2202]]]'>
      <a id="p933" href="#p933" data-label="933" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*933</a>The plain language of 9 DCMR § 2009.9 states that the Board may dismiss any petition in its discretion that is incomplete or does not conform with any of the rules. However, the regulation also provides that such a dismissal will occur, “provided that” the Board inform the petitioner how the petition is incomplete and “allow the petitioner to submit the information within a prescribed time period.” 9 DCMR § 2009.9. Thus, the clause “provided that” qualifies and ultimately restricts the circumstances under which the Board may dismiss a petition. We are informed that the phrase “provided that” “ordinarily ... signifies or expresses a condition ... limitation or qualification, or a restraint, modification ... to something which precedes.” Black’s Law DictionaRY 1224 (6th ed.1990). The language “provided that” in 9 DCMR 2009.9 clearly indicates that the Board’s discretionary dismissal power only arises after, and is conditioned on the fact that, a petitioner has been first allowed to submit any missing documents within a time period prescribed by the Board, and has failed to do so. The plain language of the regulation specifies that the Board’s ability to dismiss an incomplete petition is restrained and limited by the occurrence of the two subsequent conditions in the regulations. Thus, under its regulations, the Board is not authorized to dismiss a petition merely because it is determined to be incomplete. Instead, the Board must inform the petitioner that the petition is incomplete, state the reasons why the petition is unacceptable, and provide a time frame within which the petitioner may supplement the petition in order to bring it into compliance with the Board’s rules. It is only after the petitioner has failed to provide the information in the time frame set by the Board that the Board is then authorized to dismiss the petition.</p>

In fact, in its brief, the District of Columbia initially relied on the 1986 version of 9 DCMR § 2009.9. It provides that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b967-6" data-blocks='[["BL_967.6",967,[992,354,716,439]]]'>If the petition is incomplete, the Board shall notify the petitioner in what re-spectes) it is incomplete. <em>The Board may dismiss the petition if the petitioner fails to submit the necessary information within the time set by the Board in its notice, </em>or to satisfactorily explain why the information cannot be submitted. [emphasis added.]</blockquote>
    <p id="b967-7" data-blocks='[["BL_967.7",967,[954,823,756,832]]]'>9 DCMR § 2009.9 (emphasis added). Therefore, even prior to the 1987 version of the regulations, the Board was empowered to dismiss the petition only after the petitioner failed to submit the necessary information within the time frame set by the Board. The only difference between the 1986 version of 9 DCMR § 2009.9 and the 1987 version appears to be elimination of the language allowing for a satisfactory explanation as to why the information could not be submitted. Thus, both the 1986 version and the 1987 version mandate that the Board dismiss appeal petitions only after prescribing a time frame within which a petitioner may act to cure any deficiencies.</p>
    <p id="b967-8" data-blocks='[["BL_967.8",967,[955,1692,754,587]]]'>This interpretation of 9 DCMR § 2009.9 is further bolstered by the fact that the Board’s regulations do not provide a mechanism for the reinstatement of a petition that has been dismissed because it was incomplete. Absent a process for reinstatement of a dismissed petition in the regulations, the District’s contention that the Board may dismiss an incomplete petition, because any defects can be cured ex post facto, is neither persuasive nor consistent with its own regulations.</p>
