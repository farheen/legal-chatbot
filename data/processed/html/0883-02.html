An ISP, such as Appellant, functions as an intermediary between its own customers and larger ISPs that comprise the Internet backbone, which is composed of large bandwidth networks that meet at certain points in various metropolitan areas around the world. Customers can access the services of an ISP on a dial-up basis using an ordinary analog voice-grade local telephone line that they lease from a telecommunications carrier. If the customer accesses the Inter<a id="p885" href="#p885" data-label="885" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*885</a>net through such method, the customer must use a modem to convert the computer’s digital signals into analog signals in order for the information to travel over the analog telephone lines. Once the signal reaches the ISP’s digital transport network, the customer’s information is converted back to digital format to travel across the ISP’s network. This conversion is performed by a modem at the ISP’s point of presence (“POP”), which is the physical place where the ISP operates and maintains the routers, servers, and other facilities necessary to perform its various service functions. As an alternative to dial-up service, a customer may purchase a dedicated data transport service to connect with the ISP, which provides the customer with “full-time” Internet access at higher speeds than the customer would experience using a dial-up access line.</p>

Specifically, Appellant purchased ISDN-PRI, T-l, ATM, and Frame Relay Services (collectively referred to hereinafter as “data transport systems”), which enabled Appellant to transport its customers’ information along the carriers’ lines and to connect to the Internet backbone.

It is evident from the regulations that any operation that effects a change to tangible personal property is a sufficient activity.

The parties have stipulated that Appellant converts analog signals into digital signals in order for the signals to be transmitted across Appellant’s network. This conversion places the signals into a different form that have a distinctive use, as only digital signals can pass through the ISP’s server.
