Thus, two situations might constitute exceptional circumstances justifying application of this provision: (1) where the witness is absent for some unusual reason not included in the four categories listed in the proceeding paragraphs of this subdivision; and (2) where the witness is present in court at the trial but cannot testify for some unusual reason, such as the loss of speech or memory, or simply refuses to testify.</blockquote>
