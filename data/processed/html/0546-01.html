    <p id="b595-10" data-blocks='[["BL_595.10",595,[193,1979,749,276]]]'>On November 19, 1974, Malcolm Knowl-ton was a passenger in an automobile operated by William Rhodes. An accident occurred when Rhodes lost control of the car. Knowlton brought an action to recover damages for his personal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b595-11" data-blocks='[["BL_595.11",595,[192,2277,751,133]],["BL_595.12",595,[995,262,755,417]]]'>After a jury-waived trial in Superior Court, Knox County, the trial justice found that the defendant William Rhodes, had far exceeded the speed limit and was intoxicated at the time of the accident. The justice concluded that the plaintiff was not negligent and that the defendant’s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. The justice further found that the defendant’s actions amounted to reckless conduct. As to damages, the justice said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b595-16" data-blocks='[["BL_595.13",595,[1030,704,720,656]]]'>The Court finds and assesses compensatory damage in the amount of seventy-five hundred dollars ($7500.00). Since this case was not declared a reckless misconduct and no prayer for punitive damages was asked for or demanded, the Court does not assess punitive damages, but finds punitive damages in the amount of twenty-five hundred dollars ($2500.00). Judgment will be entered for the Plaintiff against the Defendant in the sum of seventy-five hundred dollars ($7500.00), together with costs. Are there any questions from counsel?</blockquote>
    <p id="b595-17" data-blocks='[["BL_595.14",595,[992,1393,756,759]]]'>The plaintiff then moved to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence, specifically to allege that the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the defendant’s wilful, wanton, and reckless disregard for plaintiff’s safety. After hearing, the trial justice granted the motion, stating that the defendant’s own testimony had satisfied him that defendant’s recklessness caused the injuries. The trial justice granted the motion to amend on the ground that the situation came within Rule 15(b), M.R.Civ.P.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> However, he did not assess the punitive damages that he had already found at trial but again ordered judgment for $7500, with costs.</p>

The plaintiff has not cross-appealed. We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[216,416,752,657]]]'>Any action taken by this Court would have no impact on the outcome of the case before us. Regardless of the result of this appeal, the plaintiff has a judgment against the defendant for $7500 for compensatory damages based on a finding of negligence. The defendant does not raise any issue on appeal challenging the finding of negligence on his part or the lack of negligence on the part of the plaintiff. A decision of this Court that the complaint should not have been amended could not affect the amount of damages awarded by the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[212,1102,755,1038]],["BL_596.6",596,[1017,262,755,227]]]'>Appellant has not pointed out any collateral effect of the Superior Court ruling that would be detrimental to his legal interests. The case is not one of some public concern where there might be need for an appellate adjudication of a recurrent controversy otherwise evading review or where continued uncertainty in the law might entail serious social costs. Therefore, since a decision by this Court would not afford appellant any effective relief, considerations of judicial economy call for dismissal of the appeal on the ground of mootness. <em>State v.
