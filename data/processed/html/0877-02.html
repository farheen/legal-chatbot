The property was damaged by fire in July, 2000, and appellants filed a notice of loss. Appellee denied appellants’ claim November 21, 2000, on the basis of concealment or fraud. On May 3, 2002, appellants filed a complaint against appellee alleging breach of contract. Appellee responded by filing a motion for summary judgment, asserting appellants’ breach of contract claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations period set forth in the policy.</p>

Appellee opposed that motion, arguing the bad faith claim was untimely since it was subject to the two-year statute of limitations applicable to tort actions. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(7). Appellants contended this was a contract action with a six-year statute of limitations. On September 15, 2003, the trial court granted appellee’s motion for summary judgment with regard to the breach of contract claim, and denied appellants’ request to amend the complaint, having determined a § 8371 bad faith claim is a “statutorily created tort action and is therefore subject to the two-year statute of limitations of [§ 5524(7)].” Trial Court Opinion, 9/15/03, at 7. It thus held appellants’ bad faith claim was time-barred. On appeal, the Superior Court agreed with the trial court’s analysis, stating, “[w]e find the reasoning supporting those decisions to be persuasive and thus hold that a bad faith action under [§ 8371] is subject to a two-year statute of limitations.” <em>See Ash v.

Accordingly, an action under § 8371 is distinct from the common law cause of action for breach of the contractual duty of good faith. Thus, the case law indicating the duty of good faith and fair dealing sounds exclusively in contract is inapposite here as those cases address the separate contractual duty of good faith. The remaining question is whether a bad faith action under § 8371 sounds primarily in tort or whether it sounds equally in tort and contract.</p>

With this distinction in mind, we note the legislature apparently determined the protections afforded by the Unfair Insurance Practices Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> were insufficient to curtail certain bad faith acts by insurers and that it was in the public interest to enact § 8371 as an additional protection. As this Court stated in <em>D’Ambrosio, </em>“it is for the Legislature to announce and implement the Commonwealth’s public policy governing the regulation of insurance carriers.” <em>DAmbrosio, </em>at 970. The legislature did precisely this when it enacted § 8371, thereby formally imposing a duty of good faith on insurers based on its apparent determination that such a provision was necessary to deter bad faith. Therefore, the duty under § 8371 is one imposed by law as a matter of social policy, rather than one imposed by mutual consensus, and an action to recover damages for a breach of that duty derives primarily from the law of torts. Consequently, we conclude the Superior Court properly determined an action under § 8371 is a statutorily-created tort action and we therefore hold such an action is subject to the two-year statute of limitations under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524.</p>

Our review of the case law indicates considerable disagreement over the applicability of the implied duty of good faith. Section 205 of the Restatement of Contracts states: “Every contract imposes on each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205. Some courts have opined that Pennsylvania has adopted § 205. <em>See, e.g., Herzog v. Herzog, </em><a href="/a2d/887/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="887 A.2d 313" data-case-ids="8999244" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0313-01">887 A.2d 313</a>, 317 (Pa.Super.2005); <em>Conomos, Inc. v.
