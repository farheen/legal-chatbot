(Harleysville). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 10, 2008, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and examining the memoranda they submitted, we are of the opinion that this appeal may be decided at this time without further briefing or argument.

The plaintiff, who was insured by defendant Harleysville, was a passenger in the Dorsey vehicle at the time of the collision. As a result of the accident, plaintiff claimed that she incurred lost wages and medical bills, and experienced pain and suffering. Dorsey’s insurance carrier, Arbella Insurance Company (Arbella), subsequently paid plaintiff $8,000 in personal injury protection (PIP)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> benefits pursuant to Mass.

However, plaintiff received a net amount of $13,816.21 after the arbitrator reduced the total award by the $8,000 PIP payment Arbella previously had made to Shepard under the policy that the company issued to Dorsey. After the arbitrator’s award was issued, a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice was entered in the pending Massachusetts civil action.</p>

Shepard timely appealed to this Court, and she now argues that (1) she has standing to seek UM benefits because the gross amount of the damages she was awarded by the arbitrator exceeded the Sheridans’ policy limit, and (2) collateral estoppel is inapplicable because there is no privity between the defendants in the cases. Har-leysville counters that Shepard lacks standing to assert a UM claim and further that she is collaterally estopped from re-litigating the amount of damages suffered because of the binding-arbitration award and the subsequent dismissal of her case in the Massachusetts District Court.</p>

    <p id="b216-9" data-blocks='[["BL_216.9",216,[1005,663,755,1443]]]'>Nonetheless, we hold that summary judgment is appropriate in this case because there is no dispute as to any material fact and Shepard does not have a legally valid claim for UM coverage. Because the accident occurred in Massachusetts but Shepard was the named insured on a policy issued in accordance with the laws of Rhode Island, we must review the relevant laws of both states. In Massachusetts, PIP benefits are “granted <em>in lieu of damages </em>otherwise recoverable by the injured person or persons in tort as a result of an accident occurring within this commonwealth.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 34M (emphasis added). PIP benefits, therefore, are clearly not damages. Moreover, a carrier that pays such benefits has a right of subrogation; otherwise, a plaintiff could be compensated for medical payments and actual lost wages twice — once from the carrier providing PIP benefits and again from the tortfeasor’s carrier as damages. Such a double recovery would be directly at odds with the objective of PIP. <em>See Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v.
