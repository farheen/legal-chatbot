Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying Appellant’s petition for DNA testing to determine whether the victim was the biological father of the children at issue.

Appellant reminded the trial court that the sentencing order provided that either the Commonwealth or Appellant could seek a modification of the payment schedule in the event Appellant’s income status changed. Following a hearing, by order entered on September 10, 2002, the trial court reduced Appellant’s monthly payment to $500.00 per month; however, the trial court did not alter the total amount of restitution, which was to be paid to the victim’s children. The trial court further indicated that either party could seek modification of the payment schedule based on a change in income.</p>

At the hearing, the Commonwealth presented evidence that, on May 25, 1999, Appellant signed a stipulation of fact, which was submitted to a worker’s compensation judge, indicating that the victim <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>was survived by two minor children.

N.T. 7/13/06 at 16-17. However, Appellant admitted that, at the hearing before the worker’s compensation judge, Appellant never raised the issue of paternity, and the worker’s compensation judge’s opinion states that the victim was the father of the children. N.T. 7/13/07 at 19-22. Appellant further admitted that, pursuant to the terms of his negotiated guilty plea before the trial court, the worker’s compensation judge’s findings regarding the total amount of restitution was accepted by the trial court.

Appellant contends the trial court could have ordered DNA testing and then alter the restitution order under 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 5505, since there were “extraordinary circumstances or fraud.”</p>
