    <p id="b1212-20" data-blocks='[["BL_1212.18",1212,[993,547,748,126]]]'>In <em>Davies v.

Undoubtedly there are many causes of action which have arisen in the past which are not now barred by the statute of limitations, and we are aware of several pending actions which are awaiting the outcome of this case. The doctrine of governmental immunity has been applied since the! inception of statehood in Maine and government agencies were entitled to rely on its continued application. The normal practice in cases such as this in which we make a departure from the rules of the past is to limit the applicability of the decision to causes of action arising after a certain date and to grant relief to the instant parties. <em>See Jones v. Billings, </em><a href="/a2d/289/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="289 A.2d 39" data-case-ids="11249343" data-case-paths="/a2d/289/0039-01">289 A.2d 39</a> (Me.1972).</blockquote>
