    <p id="b573-11" data-blocks='[["BL_573.10",573,[181,1495,752,957]]]'>On July 30, 1963, the petitioner, Richard A. Hamner, then a juvenile of the age of 16 years, was adjudicated to have committed a juvenile offense on a petition charging him with the larceny of an automobile valued at more than one hundred dollars. The Judge of the juvenile court sentenced him to the Reformatory for Men under 15 M.R.S.A. § 2611, (4 A). On June 7, 1964, while undergoing imprisonment at that institution pursuant to said judgment of sentence, Hamner escaped, but was promptly recaptured. In information proceedings in the Superior Court for the County of Cumberland with counsel representation, he entered a plea of guilty to the charge of escape and was sentenced and committed to the state prison for a term of two to four years. No appeal was taken from his state prison sentence.</p>

He contends that the deprivation of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in the juvenile proceedings rendered the court’s sentence to the Reformatory for Men absolutely void and that he committed no crime of escape when he left the institution as he was merely escaping from unlawful detention.</p>
    <p id="b573-14" data-blocks='[["BL_573.13",573,[983,896,754,375]]]'>The pertinent escape statute reads as follows: “Whoever, <em>being lawfully detained </em>in any jail or other place of confinement, except the State Prison, breaks or escape therefrom, or attempts to do so, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 7 years.” [Emphasis supplied.] 17 M.R.S.A. § 1405.</p>

Batherson, Associate Judge of the Juvenile Court for the Town of Rumford, held at Rumford, in the County of Oxford and State of Maine, on the thirtieth day of July, A. D. 1963 for a Juvenile offence, which offence was within the jurisdiction of said Court, and upon the seventh day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty-four, the said Richard A. Hamner did then and there willfully, unlawfully and felo-niously from and out of said Reformatory for Men escape and go at large” etc.</blockquote>

The issue of lawful detention was before the criminal court and was laid to rest by virtue of petitioner’s plea of guilty, as much so as if the issue had been contested by the petitioner and found against him by the jury.
