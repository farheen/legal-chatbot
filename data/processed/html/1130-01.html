While Ocken-house has evidently accepted his conviction and sentence of death and has implicitly expressed his desire to forego appellate consideration of his case, our court is nevertheless required to review the decision imposing a sentence of death for adherence to our Commonwealth’s Sentencing Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Following a detailed review of the record and the trial court’s opinion, for the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the judgment of sentence imposed by the trial court.</p>

Ockenhouse was convicted and sentenced for an undisclosed crime arising in Carbon County, Pennsylvania. On March 30, 1998, Ockenhouse was paroled to the Keenan House, located in Allentown, Lehigh County Pennsylvania. Keenan House contracts with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections as a parole site for inmates leaving correctional institutions. Ockenhouse was paroled-to Keenan House as an inpatient for receipt of drug and alcohol treatment and for development of a permanent home plan.</p>

    <p id="b1167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.4",1167,[147,371,753,639]]]'>Ockenhouse proceeded to the home of Curtis Kratzer, a former acquaintance. The victim, 91-year-old -widow Naomi Spankowitch, was Kratzer’s sister. Mrs. Spankowitch lived next door to her brother. From having stayed with Kratzer on previous occasions, Ockenhouse knew that Mrs. Spankowitch took care of Kratzer’s financial affairs. On April 11, 1998, Ock-enhouse sought Kratzer’s opinion as to whether his sister would loan Ockenhouse some money. Kratzer replied that she would not lend Ockenhouse money.</p>
    <p id="b1167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.5",1167,[149,1045,751,189]]]'>The next day, Ockenhouse went to Mrs. Spankowitch’s home where by his own admission he killed her and took approximately $100.00 from her wallet.</p>
    <p id="b1167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.6",1167,[149,1269,754,1329]]]'>With regard to the manner of the killing, Ockenhouse pushed Mrs. Spankowitch onto her bed and first stuffed a pair of underwear into her mouth. He then kneed her in the back, fracturing her spine in three places. After breaking her back, Ockenhouse left the bedroom and went into the kitchen. However, he discovered that Mrs. Spankowitch remained alive, whereupon he took a knife from the kitchen and began cutting and stabbing Mrs. Spankowitch. Ockenhouse cut her neck laterally several times in the front. These slashes cut through Mrs. Spankowitch’s throat to her spine, severing her carotid artery and jugular vein. Above and below these incisions were seven stab wounds, one of which severed her right carotid artery. All of the stab wounds were inflicted prior to the deep slashing wounds. Also, an additional puncture wound was discovered on the victim’s neck. There was a single stab wound to her back that occurred at or near the time of death. The knife was found imbedded in Mrs. Spankowitch’s back when her body was discovered.</p>
    <p id="b1167-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.9",1167,[946,244,757,735]]]'>Ockenhouse was arrested and rendered a confession to police. The Commonwealth filed notice of two aggravating circumstances: that the killing occurred during the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and that Mrs. Spankowitch was killed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8). Trial was set for November 30, 1998. On that date, Ockenhouse entered into a guilty plea to first-degree murder, robbery, theft, and receiving stolen property. The guilty plea was accepted following a colloquy in which it was established that Ockenhouse knowingly and voluntarily entered the plea.</p>
    <p id="b1167-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.10",1167,[948,1002,756,585]]]'>On December 3, 1998, the date of sentencing, Ockenhouse motioned for the withdrawal of his attorneys, which was granted, subject to the trial court’s order that counsel be present to assist Ocken-house. The trial court then engaged in a colloquy regarding Ockenhouse’s competence and his desire to waive his right to have a jury decide his sentence. The trial court deemed Ockenhouse to be competent and accepted his waiver of sentencing by jury.</p>
    <p id="b1167-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1167.11",1167,[949,1609,757,735]]]'>The trial court heard the Commonwealth’s evidence regarding the two aggravating circumstances. Ockenhouse refused to present any mitigating evidence, despite his counsel’s indication of the existence of such evidence. The trial court conducted a colloquy regarding Ocken-house’s decision to forego the presentation of mitigating evidence. The trial court permitted counsel to proceed with its offer of proof of mitigating evidence and allowed such information to be submitted into the record for purposes of confirming Ocken-house’s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to present mitigating evidence.</p>

Specifically, the trial court found that the Commonwealth had established the two proffered aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. <a id="p1134" href="#p1134" data-label="1134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1134</a>Furthermore, in accord with Ockenhouse’s decision to withhold mitigation evidence, the trial court found no mitigating circumstances. Ockenhouse filed no post-sentence motions. However, Ockenhouse, through his attorneys filed a Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The trial court issued a memorandum opinion in response thereto. Pursuant to the automatic direct appeal provisions found in 42 Pa.C.S. § 722(4) and § 9711(h)(1), the case progressed to this court for our review.</p>
    <p id="b1168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1168.4",1168,[209,908,754,629]]]'>As noted above, it is evidently Ocken-house’s intention that our court affirm his conviction and judgment of sentence. Ockenhouse’s letter to this court, received February 10, 2000, indicated that he did not intend to file a brief. Moreover, in his letter, Ockenhouse, <em>inter alia, </em>stood by his decision to proceed <em>pro se, </em>his decision to enter a guilty plea, and his decision not to present mitigation evidence: By deciding not to file a brief, Ockenhouse has presented no issues and has set forth no argument for our consideration.</p>

Once inside the victim’s home, Oekenhouse stuffed a pair of underwear into Mrs. Spankowitch’s mouth and fractured her spine in three places. After realizing that she was still alive, Oekenhouse stabbed Mrs. Spankowitch with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat which resulted in the severing of her carotid artery and jugular vein. We conclude that the evidence, and all reasonable inferences deduced therefrom, when viewed in the fight most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the Commonwealth met its burden of establishing the elements of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

After arriving at the residence of Curtis Kratzer, Oekenhouse asked Kratzer whether his sister would lend him money, to which Kratzer replied that she would not. The next day, Oekenhouse went to Mrs. Span-kowitch’s home and, pursuant to his own admission, he killed her and took $100 from her wallet. Mrs. Spankowitch’s purse, which contained the money, hung in the closet of the same room in which her body was found.

Only after Mrs. Span-kowitch’s body moved did Ockenhouse realize that he had not killed her by strangu<a id="p1138" href="#p1138" data-label="1138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1138</a>lation and that she remained alive.

All other wounds were deep, including the slicing wounds which cut Mrs. Spankowitch’s jugular vein and carotid artery. Distinguishable from other situations in which torture was established, there were no wounds on her arms, face, chest or other non-vital areas which would have indicated an intent to cause pain and suffering in addition to the intent to kill. Rather, the wounds were inflicted to a vital area of the body, the neck. As to consciousness during the attack, the evidence was simply unclear as to whether Mrs. Spankowitch was aware of what was going on although there was no indication that she was. unconscious.

However, we find it particularly critical to our determination regarding torture that Ockenhouse confessed to first purposely jumping on Mrs. Spankowitch’s back with his knee. Mrs. Spankowitch, who was 91-years-old at the time of the killing stood five foot three inches and weighed one hundred and forty pounds. This assault resulted in three separate fractures to Mrs. Spankow-itch’s spine. Ockenhouse felt Mrs. Span-kowitch’s bones break as he drove his knee into her back. This renders the episode qualitatively different than if Ockenhouse had killed by stabbing alone. Dr. Sara Funke, a forensic pathologist, testified that Mrs. Spankowitch’s spine fractures were consistent with her back being forced backwards, which although not lethal, would have been enormously painful and would have rendered her helpless.</p>
