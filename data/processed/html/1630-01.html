      <a id="p1634" href="#p1634" data-label="1634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1634</a>Those statements were entirely valid, we still think, <em>as applied to the facts in Stempel </em>where the reference showed a species of the generic invention being claimed in the appealed claims. As frequently happens, however, the statements are bound enough to encompass the very different situation we now have before us and which was present in <em>Blair. </em>There is a difficulty in discussing it because of the ambiguity of the word “part” in speaking of “part of an invention.” It can mean such a “part” as the species which Stempel invented, which was part of his claimed genus. It can mean an element or subcombination of elements forming part of a larger combination of elements making-up a machine such as the bowling pin spotting device of <em>Blair. </em>Or it can mean an alloying ingredient or an alloy containing all but one of the essential ingredients, as here. In one sense, a stainless steel alloy containing nitrogen but no molybdenum is a part., even a large part, of appellant's alloy; in a more accurate sense, however, it is not a “part” <em>of his invention </em>at all because his invention does not exist at all until there is an alloy containing <em>both </em>nitrogen and holybdenum.</p>

    <p id="b958-4" data-blocks='[["BL_958.5",958,[288,1481,1324,238]]]'>In our view, appellant was never in possession of any “part” of his claimed invention until he was in possession of the stainless steel alloy combination containing both nitrogen and molybdenum.

We will not now sanction such a broad rule. It is contrary to <em>Stempel. </em>The primary consideration is whether, in addition to showing what the reference shows, the affidavit also establishes possession of either the <em>whole </em>invention claimed or something falling <em>within </em>the claim, in the sense that the claim as a whole reads on it.</p>

Although differences in heat treatment do exist, there is nothing before us to suggest that these slight differences would affect both strength and ductility.</p>
    <p id="b960-8" data-blocks='[["BL_960.8",960,[358,1433,1326,94]]]'>The solicitor treats the improved properties in a somewhat different manner, stating:</p>
    <blockquote id="b960-9" data-blocks='[["BL_960.9",960,[358,1551,1327,159]]]'>Certainly, the references show that it is known that steels containing either molybdenum or nitrogen have good elongation, and appellant has not shown that the improved elongation of his steel is anything other than the expected additive effects of molybdenum and nitrogen. * * *</blockquote>
    <p id="b960-10" data-blocks='[["BL_960.10",960,[356,1735,1328,195]]]'>
      <em>We </em>are at a loss to know where the references indicate that the additive effect of molybdenum and nitrogen is improved elongation. We are of the view that the combination of strength and ductility would be unexpected from the cited prior art.</p>
    <p id="b960-11" data-blocks='[["BL_960.11",960,[359,1938,1325,499]],["BL_961.1",961,[181,284,1323,298]]]'>The solicitor further argues that even if the elongation is unexpected, the claimed alloy is obvious because it is obvious to make an alloy containing both nitrogen and molybdenum for their desired property. In this regard we note in reading the references cited by the Patent Office that the formulation of a suitable alloy cannot be done merely by adding one element characterized as a strength additive or another as an elongation additive. For example, Goller notes that aluminum has been recognized as a deoxidizing material. However, aluminum was considered to impair hardenability but in the Goller composition aluminum aided hardening. Turn columns in the Goller patent <a id="p1637" href="#p1637" data-label="1637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1637</a>describe various additives that may be included and the delicate balance that must be maintained between these additives. Walton teaches that the response of various alloys to aging treatments varies widely for reasons unknown. In view of this reported difficulty in balancing the properties and compositions of alloys, it appears that the solicitor’s approach is unrealistic.</p>
    <p id="b961-4" data-blocks='[["BL_961.4",961,[180,588,1325,195]]]'>In the absence of either a suggestion in the cited art that nitrogen and molybdenum should be combined in one alloy or of an alloy having properties similar to appellant’s, we hold that the claimed composition is unobvious within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 103.</p>
