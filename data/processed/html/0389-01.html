Appellant, Alexis Hodges Brown, appeals from an adverse grant of summary judgment in a proceeding arising under the District of Columbia Guardianship, Protective Proceedings, and Durable Power of Attorney Act of 1986. <em>See </em>D.C.Code §§ 21-2001 to -2098 (1997 Repl.). Ms. Brown, who had had no contact with her father in over three years, initiated the proceeding to have a guardian and conservator appointed for her father, appellee, John T. Hodges, whom she believes to be suffering from mental illness or other mental conditions that may have affected Mr. Hodges’ ability to manage his affairs. Mr. Hodges filed a motion for summary judgment with accompanying affidavits, which Ms. Hodges opposed with other affidavits. Ms. Hodges subsequently filed the affida<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>vit of Nathan A. Billig, M.D., requesting that he be recognized as an expert witness, and a request for further limited discovery. The trial court granted Mr. Hodges’ motion for summary judgment, dismissed the discovery requests, and denied the request to recognize the additional affidavit of the expert witness. Ms. Hodges timely appealed these determinations.</p>

Ct. Civ. R. 56(c) (2000); <em>Big Builders, Inc. v. Israel, </em><a href="/a2d/709/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="709 A.2d 74" data-case-ids="11827628" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0074-01">709 A.2d 74</a>, 76 n. 1 (D.C.1998). D.C.Code § 21-2022 provides that “[ujnless specifically provided to the contrary in this chapter or inconsistent with its provisions, the rules of the court ... govern proceedings [for appointment of guardians and conservators] under this chapter.” <em>See In re Langon, </em><a href="/a2d/663/1248-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="663 A.2d 1248" data-case-ids="7882786" data-case-paths="/a2d/663/1248-01">663 A.2d 1248</a>, 1250 (D.C.1995) (holding that existing rules of trial and appellate practice apply to intervention proceedings). This is an appropriate case for summary judgment because Ms. Brown has failed to raise a material issue of fact as to Mr. Hodges’ ability to provide for his financial and personal needs, as evidenced by his income level and present living arrangement. Moreover, Mr. Hodges has already made further provision for the event of his incapacity by investing his son, Stephen Hodges, with his power of attorney, thus obviating the need for court intervention. Ms. Brown has made no allegation that this appointment was improper, that her brother is incapable of adequately performing his duties in the event of Mr. Hodges’ incapacity, or that the power of attorney is insufficient.</p>

Mr. Hodges left early the next morning saying he was going to the U.S. Air Force Academy Hospital. Later, a "senior victim volunteer” from the Colorado Springs Police Department called on Mr. Hodges’ behalf and directed Ms. Brown and Mr. Kover to leave Mr. Hodges’ home because he had filed an elder abuse claim against her.
