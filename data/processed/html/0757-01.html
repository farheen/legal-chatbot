We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b824-20" data-blocks='[["BL_824.20",824,[1014,489,753,708]]]'>Aloe Coal is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in the business of mining, transporting, and marketing coal and coal-related products. This dispute arises out of Aloe Coal’s usage of a state roadway known as LR02003 (the roadway or LR02003) to transport coal to distribution points. LR02003 is a 2.46-mile stretch of road located in Allegheny County between station 62+ and station 191 + 96. The roadway is constructed mostly of dirt with some areas of blacktop or oil and chip paving. Although the roadway was used by many industries throughout its existence, by 1983, Aloe Coal was its primary heavy industrial user.</p>
    <p id="b824-21" data-blocks='[["BL_824.21",824,[1013,1220,752,515]]]'>On July 13, 1983, Aloe Coal and DOT entered into an Excess Maintenance Agreement (EMA), which DOT drafted, whereby Aloe Coal agreed to perform or pay for any maintenance of LR02003 necessitated by its coal truck traffic. Aloe Coal also agreed to post a bond as security for performing its maintenance obligation. A memorandum dated December 8, 1982 was attached to the EMA. This memorandum provides, in pertinent part:</p>

Prior to the time when Aloe Coal entered into the EMA with DOT, Aloe Coal often undertook voluntary repairs on LR02003. Aloe Coal alleges that these voluntary repairs were undertaken because DOT historically ignored the condition of the road.</p>
    <p id="b825-6" data-blocks='[["BL_825.5",825,[172,943,756,700]]]'>In the spring of 1984, a landslide occurred causing the collapse of three sections of the western side of LR02003. DOT closed the roadway from May of 1984 until August of 1985, because the conditions on the roadway were so hazardous that they precluded use by the public. DOT closed the road pursuant to Paragraph 11 of the EMA which provides, in pertinent part: “This Agreement shall not prohibit the Department from closing a road or bridge to any vehicle or combination in excess of a specific weight if such closing is authorized by law and is necessary for safety, or is a temporary closing due to climatic conditions or act of God.”</p>

After LR02003 was closed down, Aloe Coal used alternative roads, but use of these roads increased the costs in time and money needed for Aloe Coal to service its customers, because LR02003 was the shortest route for Aloe Coal to take its coal to the major markets.</p>
    <p id="b825-8" data-blocks='[["BL_825.7",825,[173,2411,755,276]],["BL_825.8",825,[974,246,757,520]]]'>Aloe Coal eventually determined that if it wanted to use LR02003 in the near future it would have to repair the roadway itself. Reluctantly, Aloe Coal repaired LR02003 because it decided that fixing the road would save the company money. At the time it made the repairs to LR02003, Aloe Coal knew that it was not obligated by the EMA to make those repairs, because Paragraph 5 of the EMA provided: “The USER [Aloe Coal] shall have no obligation for maintenance to remedy damage resulting from washout, landslide or act of God or for removal of snow or ice.” After Aloe Coal repaired the roadway, DOT reopened the roadway and permitted Aloe Coal to resume hauling on it.</p>
    <p id="b825-11" data-blocks='[["BL_825.11",825,[974,807,756,423]]]'>In the spring of 1986, part of LR02003 was washed out, and DOT closed the roadway in April, 1986 for two months. DOT reiterated to Aloe Coal that it did not have the resources to repair the roadway. Aloe Coal again undertook the repairs of the washed out area of the roadway to save money and to avoid using alternate roads for an extended period of time.</p>
    <p id="b825-12" data-blocks='[["BL_825.12",825,[973,1270,756,906]]]'>On October 20, 1987, Aloe Coal filed a claim against DOT for damages in the amount of $231,723. In its claim statement, Aloe Coal averred that by the terms of the memorandum attached to the EMA, DOT was obligated to repair or install the drainage facility for LR02003. Aloe Coal alleged that DOT’S failure to undertake the repairs of LR02003’s drainage system caused the 1984 landslide and the 1986 washout and, therefore, DOT was liable for reimbursing Aloe Coal for the cost of repairs and for Aloe Coal’s increased transportation costs while LR02003 was damaged and closed. On March 17, 1988, Aloe Coal filed an amended claim but did not change the amount of damages it sought from DOT. After preliminary objections were ruled upon by the Board, DOT filed its answer on May 12, 1988.</p>

At these hearings, Aloe Coal presented the testimony of three witnesses, David Aloe, President of Aloe Coal, Pascal F. Belculfine, a registered professional engineer and expert witness who had participated on Aloe Coal’s behalf in the process of forming the EMA between Aloe Coal and DOT, and David Wain, a licensed civil engineer and soil engineering expert.</p>

      <a id="p760" href="#p760" data-label="760" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*760</a>David Aloe (Mr. Aloe) testified about the business operations of Aloe Coal and how the closure of LR02003 affected Aloe Coal’s business decisions. Specifically, Mr. Aloe testified that: (1) after entering into the EMA, DOT never contacted Aloe Coal to inform him that DOT considered the damage to the drainage facility on LR02003 to be Aloe Coal’s responsibility; (2) DOT never repaired or replaced the drainage facility on LR02003; (3) when DOT closed LR02003, Aloe Coal made the repairs after DOT refused to do so, because Mr. Aloe thought that action would save money in the long term and believed that area residents would be displeased with Aloe Coal’s prolonged use of alternative roads; and (4) Aloe Coal made the repairs despite the fact that DOT had not ordered it to make the repairs and had not promised or otherwise indicated that it would reimburse Aloe Coal for the cost of the repairs.</p>
    <p id="b826-4" data-blocks='[["BL_826.4",826,[203,1267,755,1084]]]'>Pascal Belculfine (Belculfine) testified about the physical condition of LR02003 at different times relevant to the history of this case and about the damages that Aloe Coal incurred during the closure of LR02003. On direct examination, Belculfine testified to the following observations: (1) That he was present on behalf of Aloe Coal at the original inspection of LR02003 in December of 1982, upon which inspection the EMA was based; (2) that in December of 1982 there were a number of cross drains on LR02003 that were in deplorable condition including the ends of pipes in ten to twelve areas that were clogged, corroded, or collapsed; (3) that in 1984 a landslide occurred when three sections of the western side of LR02003 collapsed; (4) that in 1986, a washout occurred in the area of LR02003 referred to as the S-tum; and (5) that DOT closed LR02003 from May, 1984 until August, 1985 after the landslide and from April, 1986 until June, 1986 after the washout.</p>
    <p id="b826-5" data-blocks='[["BL_826.5",826,[203,2385,754,373]],["BL_826.6",826,[1009,243,751,463]]]'>Belculfine also testified on direct examination that, as a result of the slide and the washout, Aloe Coal incurred damages of: $99,700.00 for repairs to LR02003 after the 1986 washout; $32,500.00 for the repairs to LR02003 after the 1984 landslide; $83,511.00 in extra hauling costs incurred during the two time periods when DOT closed LR02003; and $15,908 in costs related to the shared use of an alternative route with another company, Browning Ferris Industries during the two time periods when LR02003 was closed. Moreover, in answer to the Board’s query, Belculfine testified that during discussions between DOT and Aloe Coal subsequent to the road closures, the issue of responsibility for damage to the LR02003 drainage facilities was never raised.</p>
    <p id="b826-7" data-blocks='[["BL_826.7",826,[1005,740,756,1273]]]'>Since Belculfine was Aloe Coal’s primary engineering expert witness, DOT cross-examined him extensively. On cross-examination Belculfine testified: (1) that prior to entering into the EMA with DOT, Aloe Coal maintained LR02003, because it was the main access road to their major customers; (2) that a record rain fall had occurred in November of 1985, whereby 11.5 inches of rain fell and played havoc with the mostly dirt road; (3) that he sent a letter to DOT dated April 23, 1984, wherein he advised DOT that a backhoe being used by Bell Telephone Company was causing a mounding of dirt in a ditch, which mounding directed water back on the roadway; and (4) that a number of factors probably contributed to the 1984 landslide, including bad drainage on the road, water lying in the ditch that was not able to go to conduits, which should have conveyed the excess water from the uphill side to the lower side of the road, the soaking of the road bed in the subsurface area which allowed water to enter into the substructure of the road, and the cutting away of the toe of sloughed material that was on the bottom of the bank.</p>
    <p id="b826-8" data-blocks='[["BL_826.8",826,[1004,2048,754,708]],["BL_827.1",827,[171,247,754,126]]]'>David Wain (Wain), a soils engineering expert, also testified on Aloe Coal’s behalf. Wain opined that the 1984 landslide was caused by the leakage of runoff water into the substratum and the heaviness of the roadway soil caused by melting snow through the month preceding the slide. Moreover, Wain opined that the 1986 washout of LR02003 was caused by poor drainage. Specifically, Wain stated that he believed that the inadequate drainage pipes on the roadway, which were either clogged or undersized, allowed runoff water to pass over the surface of the road rather than empty into the drainage system. Wain also disagreed <a id="p761" href="#p761" data-label="761" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*761</a>■with DOT’s suggestion that the 1986 washout was caused primarily by a record rainfall which occurred in November of 1985.</p>
    <p id="b827-4" data-blocks='[["BL_827.4",827,[170,408,755,994]]]'>On cross-examination, DOT repeatedly assailed Wain’s credibility. Wain conceded that neither he nor anyone from his company visited the actual site of the landslide or washout areas and that his opinions were largely based upon Belculfine’s observations. DOT’s cross-examination also elicited admissions from Wain that he had no personal knowledge of where the drainage pipes were in relation to the landslide area and that he did not know how deep the drainage pipes were located. Wain also admitted that he did not perform any tests for subsurface water, nor did he perform any calculations for failure analysis, stress analysis, or foundation tests. A question from the Board also prompted Wain to admit that although he had testified on direct examination that LR02003’s drainage pipes were undersized, he did not actually know the size of those drainage pipes.</p>

Popovich (Popovich), a Maintenance Operations Engineer for DOT, was the only witness who testified on DOT’s behalf. Popovich testified about: the condition of LR02003 at various points in time; the history of DOT’s maintenance of LR02003; DOT’s reasons for closing LR02003 in 1984 and 1986; and his opinion regarding the cause of the 1984 landslide and the 1986 washout. Specifically, Popovich testified: (1) that in June of 1983, DOT graded the surface of LR02003, added gravel, and applied oil to the roadway in order to control dust; (2) that a June 20, 1983 Bonded Road Inspection Report indicated that LR02003 was in good shape; (3) that DOT closed LR02003 in 1984 and 1986, because on both occasions the road posed a hazard to the general public and Paragraph 11 of the EMA authorized DOT to close the road if it was necessary for safety reasons; (4) that DOT was unable to schedule immediate repairs to LR02003 after the 1984 landslide because of insufficient funding and the low priority of the road; (5) that DOT did not order or direct Aloe Coal to undertake repairs after the 1984 landslide or the 1986 washout and that Aloe Coal’s repairs were strictly voluntary; (6) that Aloe Coal left windrows on the low side of the highway thereby trapping water on the road; (7) that in the area of the S-turn or on any grades, the road water coming down the grades would wash any loose material of dirt and debris into the drainage systems and that if the drainage systems were clogged, these loose materials were partly the cause; and (8) that in his opinion, the cause of the 1984 landslide was inconclusive because of various problems, all of which could have affected causation.</p>

The Board’s conclusion of law merely asserts that no contractual provisions could be found in either in the EMA or the attached memorandum which set out the rights and duties of the parties in the situation that arose, wherein DOT closed the roadway for safety reasons, and Aloe Coal voluntarily made repairs to expedite the reopening of the roadway.</p>

DOT was certainly enriched by Aloe Coal’s decision to repair LR02003 rather than wait for DOT to make repairs, but this enrichment was not unjust for several reasons.</p>
    <p id="b833-11" data-blocks='[["BL_833.11",833,[971,1248,756,613]]]'>First, Aloe Coal did not repair the roadway under any mistaken notion that it was obligated to do so. As was found by the Board in Finding of Fact No. 13, DOT did not order or direct Aloe Coal to repair the road after the 1984 landslide or the 1986 washout. Moreover, provision 5 of the EMA clearly stated that Aloe Coal had no obligation for maintenance to remedy damage resulting from washout, landslide or an act of God. Therefore, Aloe Coal could not have reasonably believed that it was obligated to make the repairs.</p>

Mr. Aloe testified that Aloe Coal repaired the roadway, because it was cheaper and less time consuming than hauling the coal by an alternative route. Clearly, the repairs primarily benefited Aloe Coal. DOT was likewise benefited or enriched but only in an incidental manner which was not unjust.</p>

The Department never expressly indicated that it would reimburse Aloe Coal if it repaired the road. Moreover, an implied promise of reimbursement could not be reasonably inferred by Aloe Coal, because prior to Aloe Coal’s undertaking of repairs, DOT had expressly advised Aloe Coal that the primary reason it could not immediately repair the road after both disasters was that it had insufficient funding to make the repairs. Since DOT had stated that it did not have the money to make the repairs, Aloe Coal could not reasonably believe that DOT had the money to pay Aloe Coal for repairing the roadway. Therefore, quantum meruit was not a viable remedy that Aloe Coal could pursue under the given circumstances.</p>
