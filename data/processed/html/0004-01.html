On January 14, 2008, ManorCare filed a petition for reconsideration with the Secretary of Public Welfare and on January 30, 2008, ManorCare filed a petition for review with this Court. The Secretary denied Man-orCare’s petition for reconsideration on February 7, 2008. In March 2008, the Department filed an application for an order to remand with this Court to address the issues associated with ManorCare’s appeal, specifically, whether ManorCare had the authority to file an appeal on Mrs. Kenney’s behalf. On June 6, 2008, this Court denied the Department's request for remand without prejudice to address the issue in its brief on the merits. It is true, as the dissent notes, that Manor-Care opposed the Department’s remand application. ManorCare’s reason for opposing the application is not clear; it could have simply been a tactical decision if ManorCare believed that the Department had waived the issue of ManorCare's authority to appeal. In any event, this Court’s order denying the application for remand expressly preserved the issue of ManorCare’s authority, and the Department has addressed the issue in its brief. Our decision today will allow the development of a record on this key threshold issue.</p>

On January 14, 2008, ManorCare filed a petition for reconsideration with the Secretary of DPW. (Reproduced Record at 9a-10a.) Nowhere in that request for reconsideration did it mention that it had any authorization to take an appeal on behalf of Mrs. Kenny and it does not appear that it was raised anywhere else below.</p>

    <p id="b38-9" data-blocks='[["BL_38.10",38,[193,1874,750,555]]]'>The majority vacates the BHA’s order dismissing its appeal because it finds that the authorization agreement may give ManorCare the right to take an appeal on Mrs. Kenney’s behalf and remands to the Department to conduct a hearing to determine whether it has that authority. Simply, because that issue is not raised in the statement of questions or even raised in the body of the brief or raised before BHA, it is waived.</p>

Because that appeal was not forwarded within the three working-day time period, ManorCare argues that it was denied due process causing it not to be reimbursed for care it provided because of the denial of MA-LTC benefits for Mrs. Kenney. However, there is no requirement that DPW forward to the Office of Hearings and Appeal a notice of hearing within three days when its fax was incomplete and illegible. Nonetheless, it was ultimately forwarded to BHA for hearing.</p>

An appeal from the denial of a request is separate and distinct from the MA-LTC application process. Under the applicable DPW regulations, an “appellant” is the applicant or recipient who has requested the hearing and signed the appeal, and a request for a hearing is “an expression, oral or written by the client or the person acting for him, such as his legal representative, relative or friend.” <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20275.2" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="55 Pa.

While those applications were ultimately denied, a nursing home such as Manor-Care is only authorized to file an appeal of a denial of MA-LTC benefits if it has obtained a written and signed authorization statement from the appellant, in this ease, Mrs. Kenney, or an authorized representative. <em>See Chichester Kinderschool v.
