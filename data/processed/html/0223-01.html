Thus, the operative date is not the date written on the LIBC-496 Form, but rather the date on which the employer sent the Form to the claimant. Here, PRN used the United States Post Office to mail its Notice of Compensation Denial to Claimant. A copy of the envelope, admitted into evidence without objection, clearly bears the date “January 19, 1995” as stamped by both a postage meter and a United States Post Office post-mark. (R.R. at 189.) We agree with Claimant that Finding of Fact No. 12 is not supported by substantial evidence, insofar as the WCJ declares PRN “submitted” its Notice of Compensation Denial on January 4, 1995.

PRN’s “case” with regard to the medical testimony, then, was little more than a dispute between PRN and Mercy Nursing Connections as to who was liable for Claimant’s current disability.

In determining that PRN established a reasonable basis for contest, the WCAB relied on PRN’s line of inquiry at the December 18, 1995 deposition, wherein PRN sought to discredit Claimant on the basis that Claimant did not mention her own injury in completing her patient nursing notes from the evenings of November 24, 1994 and December 3, 1994. We believe that the WCAB erred in concluding that this line of questioning established a reasonable contest.

Claimant finished her shift. She did not notify her supervisor about the injury at that time, but did tell the relief nurse about it. She returned to work after the Thanksgiving holiday, and, on December 3, 1994, she injured her low back again while moving a patient in a Hoyer lift. She finished her shift that day, but on December 8, 1994 she notified her supervisor of her injury and went to the West Penn Hospital Emergency Room for treatment. Claimant has not worked since that date. (WCJ's Findings of Fact, No. 1.)</p>

Claimant also suggests that the Notice of Compensation Denial was, in effect, back-dated to appear more timely than it actually was, (Claimant’s brief at 14), and that this conduct must be penalized "to assure compliance with and respect for the law.” (Claimant’s brief at 15.) We agree with Claimant that the evidence raises the suspicion that PRN backdated its Notice and that such action would be an egregious, flagrant violation of the Act. However, as the untimely nature of the Notice alone is sufficient to warrant penalties, we need not address this issue.</p>
