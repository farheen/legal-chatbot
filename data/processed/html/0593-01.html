It may be granted that the charge absorbs more heat from the cylinder walls, resulting in a more highly heated vaporized mixture, and that as the charge absorbs more heat the walls of the cylinder are correspondingly cooled. Assuming that the method is practicable, it has some advantages over the method described in the reference. However, the <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>principle involved was fully disclosed in the Austrian patent, where it was declared that the object was to secure vaporization of the fuel by adding, after a compression of the charge in the cylinder, an expansion and compression stroke of the piston. This being so, the advantages to be obtained by an additional expansion and compression of the charge would be obvious to one of ordinary mechanical skill. But it is argued by appellant that his method is further distinguished by the fact that the charge of fuel and air maintains a constant ratio, while in the reference the admission of additional air is essential to increase the oxygen content of the charge and to increase the compression.</p>
