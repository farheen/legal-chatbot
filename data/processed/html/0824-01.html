    <p id="b872-7" data-blocks='[["BL_872.6",872,[197,828,757,1116]]]'>Melendez states that the facts in this case are similar to those in <em>Anderson. </em>In <em>Anderson, </em>Anderson was paroled in 1974 and thereafter recommitted as a technical parole violator. Anderson was thereafter reparoled in 1980 and was again arrested and recommitted as a technical parole violator. In 1981, Anderson, while on parole, was arrested on new criminal charges and ultimately convicted of those charges. Following a revocation hearing and recom-mitment as a convicted parole violator, the Board recalculated Anderson’s maximum date and included the periods which he spent at liberty while on parole in 1974 and 1980. On appeal, this court affirmed the Board’s calculation, stating that the time spent on parole in good standing pri- or to recommitment for technical violations was correctly added to Anderson’s maximum sentence after his recommitment as a convicted parole violator.</p>
