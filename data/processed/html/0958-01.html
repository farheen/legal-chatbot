Craley, </em>three members of the Craley family were involved in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist. <a href="/a2d/784/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="784 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="9464729" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0781-01">784 A.2d 781</a> (Pa.Super.2001). Thereafter, they sought uninsured motorist coverage from Appellant State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (“State Farm”), pursuant to a policy that State Farm had issued to another family member. State Farm, however, believed that it had no obligation to pay such benefits and thus, filed a declaratory judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. As the facts of the case were undisputed, the parties submitted the case to the trial court for a non-jury trial on stipulated facts pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1038.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court issued its decision and verdict on December 22, 1998, declaring State Farm responsible under the policy at issue and awarding damages to the Craleys. State Farm and the Craleys each filed a post-trial motion. In an April 26, 2000 order, the trial court denied State Farm’s motion, but granted the Craleys’ motion and amended the verdict accordingly. Twenty-nine days later, on May 25, 2000, State Farm filed a notice of appeal. However, in an <em>en banc </em>opinion and order, the Superior Court quashed the appeal as untimely. <a href="/a2d/784/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="784 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="9464729" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0781-01">784 A.2d 781</a>. The Superior Court explained in its opinion that under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the trial court’s December 22, 1998 order declaring the rights of the parties had “the force and effect of a final judgment,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532, and was therefore subject to immediate appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

President Judge Del Sole authored a dissent, specifically disagreeing with the majority’s conclusion that the appeal was untimely. While Judge Del Sole acknowledged that this Court’s decision in <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wickett </em>could be read to “eliminate the normal and time-honored procedural rules involving post-trial practice,” <a href="/a2d/784/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="784 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="9464729" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0781-01">784 A.2d at 789-90</a>, he distinguished that case from the instant one, noting that <em>Wickett </em>involved a ruling on preliminary objections, whereas the instant case involved a trial.

However, he noted that the Superior Court had not consistently applied Section 7532 of the Declaratory Judgment Act, resulting in considerable confusion among Superior Court panels. <em>Compare, e.g., Baughman v.

According to Judge Musmanno, the parties in this case were faced with a “procedural conundrum.” <em>Id. </em>at 794. On the one hand, the Declaratory Judgment Act states that any order declaring the rights of the parties has the full effect of a final judgment. On the other hand, Rules 1038.1 and 227.1 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, when read together, require that parties file post-trial motions to preserve claims for appellate review in cases submitted on stipulated facts. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 1038.1 (practice and procedure on stipulated facts shall be in accordance with rules governing trials without a jury); Pa.R.Civ.P. 227.1 (requiring filing of post-trial motions to preserve claims for appellate review). Moreover, Judge Musmanno, like Judge McEwen, noted that prior Superior Court case law on this issue was far from a model of clarity. He therefore concluded that the majority’s holding that immediate appeal was required under the Declaratory <a id="p961" href="#p961" data-label="961" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*961</a>Judgment Act should be applied prospectively only.</p>

Following a non-jury trial, the trial court, on November 6, 2000, docketed an order and opinion, granting declaratory judgment in favor of Prudential based on its conclusion that Hasson was not entitled to uninsured motorist coverage under the Prudential policy at issue. <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20D.%20%26%20C.4th%20485" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="50 Pa.

On January 11, 2001, the Hassons filed a notice of appeal with the Superior Court. However, the Superior Court quashed the appeal as untimely. In a memorandum decision, the court explained, as the <em>en banc </em>court had in <em>Craley, </em>that the Declaratory Judgment Act defines an order that declares the rights of parties either affirmatively or negatively as a “final order” and that Pa. R.A.P. 903(a) states that final orders must be appealed within thirty days of their entry. As the trial court’s November 6, 2000 order declared that Hasson had no right to recover uninsured motorists benefits from Prudential, the court concluded that it constituted a final order under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Has-sons were required to appeal that order by December 6, 2000. Noting that it was undisputed that the Hassons did not appeal the order by that date, the court quashed the Hassons’ appeal as untimely.</p>

On January 14, 2000, after a trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Motorists. Interthal- filed a post-trial motion on January 24, 2000, seeking judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On June 15, 2000, when over 120 days had elapsed since the filing of Interthal’s motion and the trial court had still not acted on the motion, Motorists sought entry of judgment pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 227.4(l)(b). That very day, the Prothono-tary entered judgment in Motorists’ favor. On July 12, 2000, within thirty days of that order, Interthal filed an áppeal with the Superior Court. The Superior Court, however, quashed the appeal as untimely, concluding that its prior decision in <em>Craley </em>was controlling. As the court explained, under the rationale of <em>Craley </em>and the authority of the Declaratory Judgment Act, Interthal was required to appeal the January 14, 2000 jury verdict within 30 days of its entry, because that verdict had affirmatively and negatively declared the rights of <a id="p962" href="#p962" data-label="962" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*962</a>the parties and therefore had the force of a final judgment.

After a trial at which the jury answered special interrogatories, the trial court, on February 6, 2001, entered an “Order Sur Special Interrogatories Rendered By Jury on Declaratory Judgment,” in which it adopted the jury’s findings and essentially declared that Homestead had an obligation to afford coverage to Penjerdel. Eight days later, on February 14, 2001, Homestead filed a motion for post-trial relief. In a July 11, 2001 order, the trial court denied that motion and entered judgment against Homestead. That same day, Homestead filed a notice of appeal to the Superior Court. Episcopal Hospital filed a motion to quash the appeal, contending that Homestead’s appeal was untimely under the Superior Court’s <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Craley. </em>The Superior Court granted the motion and issued a <em>per curiam </em>order quashing Homestead’s appeal on November 5, 2001.</p>

In concluding as such, we relied upon the Declaratory Judgment Act, which states that court declarations regarding the rights, status, and other legal relations of parties in an action “shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532. Justice Saylor contends that consistent application of this statute would require us to find that the order of the trial court in the instant case, which declared the contract between [the parties] void, is final and immediately appealable as well. However, in <em>Wickett, </em>the trial court’s order was made based upon preliminary objections, whereas here, the trial court entered its opinion and order following a trial on the merits of [plaintiffs] complaint. While the Declaratory Judgment Act states that court declarations made under the Act shall have the force of a final order, the Act also states that where issues of fact must be determined in an action seeking declaratory judgment, those issues must be determined as in other civil actions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7539; <em>see also </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1601. Therefore, where a trial court enters a declaratory order following a trial, parties must file post-trial motions from that order, as they would in any other civil proceeding, before the order may be deemed a final order for purposes of an appeal. On the other hand, where the trial court enters a declaratory order based on a pre-trial motion, as in <em>Wick-ett, </em>the parties are obviously not required to abide by the post-trial practice rules governing civil proceedings.</blockquote>

Respectfully, however, I remain of the belief that it would be better for the Court to recognize the consequences of a faithful application of <em>Wickett’s </em>statutory construction analysis, and to reassess that decision in such light. <em>See Chalkey, </em><a href="/pa/569/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="569 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="312811" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0462-01">569 Pa. at 473-74</a>, <a href="/a2d/805/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="805 A.2d 491" data-case-ids="11433616,312811" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0491-01,/pa/569/0462-01">805 A.2d at 498-99</a> (Saylor, J., concurring).</p>
