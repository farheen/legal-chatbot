In November 1996, IRPC, a Philadelphia-based real estate company that acts as a paymaster for various partnerships and corporations involved in the development and leasing of low-income housing, purchased a fidelity bond from Reliance. The bond was effective from November 1,1996, through November 1, 1997, and insured IRPC against monetary losses incurred as a result of dishonest acts committed by its employees. The bond originally provided that the limit of insurance was $700,000; however, on June 1, 1997, IRPC executed an endorsement increasing the limit of insurance to $750,000.</p>
    <p id="b939-15" data-blocks='[["BL_939.15",939,[976,853,753,1021]]]'>¶ 3 IRPC executed similar endorsements renewing the bond for consecutive one-year terms beginning on November 1, 1997, and continuing until November 1, 2000. In May 2000, IRPC discovered that its controller, Stuart Briefer, had been embezzling money from the company. Following an investigation, IRPC determined that Mr. Briefer embezzled approximately $5.1 million between August 1994 and May 2000. Thereafter, IRPC contacted Reliance and requested four proof-of-loss forms, stating that it intended to file four claims based on its belief that it had purchased four separate fidelity bonds and incurred a covered loss under each bond. In response, Reliance sent IRPC one form and explained that Mr. Briefer’s actions constituted a single loss subject to one limit of insurance.</p>

When the parties could not resolve the dispute concerning the amount recoverable under the bond, Reliance instituted this declaratory judgment action on May 2, 2001, seeking a determination that: (1) Mr. Briefer’s actions constituted a single “occurrence” under the terms of the bond; (2) IRPC was entitled to receive a single limit of insurance totaling $750,000; and (8) Reli-<a id="p914" href="#p914" data-label="914" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*914</a>anee was not obligated to compensate IRPC for tax-related fines and penalties imposed due to Mr. Briefer’s misconduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

First, <em>Karen Kane </em>was decided under California law and is therefore not binding on this Court. Second, <em>Karen Kane </em>is factually distinguishable because Reliance conceded that it issued separate policies to the insured in that case. Lastly, in accordance with the dictates of <em>Penn Township, <a href="/a2d/719/0749-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="719 A.2d 749" data-case-ids="11681815" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0749-01">supra,</a> </em>we have reviewed the policy language herein and determined that a single, continuous contract spanned the period from 1996 to 2000. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that IRPC purchased one bond in this case.</p>
    <p id="b943-8" data-blocks='[["BL_943.7",943,[980,543,754,561]]]'>¶ 17 We need not address IRPC’s second and third arguments because they are premised on the faulty assertion that IRPC purchased multiple bonds from Reliance. Similarly, IRPC’s fourth contention assailing the trial court’s determination that Reliance was not obligated to compensate IRPC for tax-related fines and penalties related to Mr. Briefer’s embezzlement scheme is moot because Reliance has already tendered the policy limit of $750,000.</p>

However, during the course of discovery, Travelers Property Casualty Corporation and Travelers Casualty and Surety Company acquired a portion of Reliance’s surety and fidelity bond business; as a result, IRPC subsequently joined those entities as additional defendants.</p>

IRPC also asserts that this ''non-cumulation” clause and the bond's "prior insurance” clause are ambiguous. <em>See </em>Appellant’s brief at 30-38. We disagree. The non-cumulation clause clarified that the applicable limit of insurance did not cumulate from year to year, and the prior insurance clause explained that if IRPC sustained a loss during a period of any prior insurance held by IRPC or predecessor in interest, Reliance would pay for the loss if certain enumerated conditions were satisfied.</p>
