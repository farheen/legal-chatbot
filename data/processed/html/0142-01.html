    <p id="b212-10" data-blocks='[["BL_212.11",212,[1000,1489,753,418]]]'>What is evident in the case before us is that JBS’ right to site specific relief as set forth in their permit requests is not clear without a determination as to what restrictions apply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, mandamus is inappropriate. Moreover, with the certainty that the law will not permit recovery at this juncture, the trial court’s order sustaining the preliminary objections must be affirmed.</p>

Our rationale, however, focuses on JBS’ lack of a clear right to the permits. We do recognize that the restrictions that each municipality deems appropriate to JBS’ permits can be established in the statutory appeal, with review by the trial court pursuant to <em>Adams </em>and 53 P.S. § 11006-A. This procedure, through the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>statutory appeal, appears to be the underlying rationale for the trial court’s decision. Furthermore, only subsequent to the decision in the statutory appeal, where the site specific relief and attached restrictions are set, can JBS assert that their right to the permits are clear. For this reason, JBS’ mandamus actions are premature. We also recognize, as JBS acknowledged at oral argument, that the sole difference between the statutory appeals and the mandamus actions is the possibility that JBS could be awarded damages in the equity suit. This difference undercuts the trial court’s holding that dismissal is proper due to a prior pending action where the same parties, the same cause of action and the same relief are involved. However, JBS must first show that it has been denied the requested permits subsequent to a determination that it possess a clear right to the permits. Only then could JBS possibly be entitled to damages. For this reason also, JBS’ mandamus actions are premature.</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[152,1394,754,660]]]'>With regard to the declaratory judgment relief sought by JBS in its equity actions, we note that JBS’ request for this relief is discussed in the argument section of its briefs, but no mention of this remedy is set out in the issues presented portion of its briefs. Pa.R.A.P. 2116 provides that “ordinarily no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of questions involved or suggested thereby;” however, in the interest of judicial thoroughness we will consider whether the Declaratory Judgments Act (DJA), as <em>amended, </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 7531-7541, may be applicable here.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[153,2076,755,508]]]'>Section 7533 of the DJA provides that a person whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a municipal ordinance may have any question of construction or validity arising under the ordinance determined and may obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations.

This argument is not persuasive; JBS has overlooked a portion of the language in Section 7541(b), which states that the remedy provided is additional and cumulative to all other remedies, “except as provided in subsection (c).” The remedy requested here by JBS falls within an exception set out in subsection (c). <em>See Kallmann v.
