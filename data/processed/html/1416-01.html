Gassett retained the law offices of Edward M. Bernstein &amp; Associates (Bernstein) to handle her personal injury claims and her dispute with Snappy regarding payment of the damage to the car. Snappy and Bernstein exchanged correspondence regarding the property damage, but seventeen months after its last letter to Bernstein, Snappy filed a complaint against Gassett to recover the amount of the damage to the car.</p>

When Gassett was involved in the accident, she was driving a car leased from Snappy. The other driver was uninsured, and Gassett carried no collision insurance; consequently, Snappy could not collect from Gassett’s carrier. Additionally, Snappy claimed that Gassett had not purchased collision insurance with her rental agreement, thereby leaving her liable for any and all damages to the car. Snappy claimed that Gassett owed it $7,962.56, the amount of the deficiency due after deducting the salvage value of the automobile.</p>

    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[349,443,1124,308]]]'>Correspondence was exchanged between Snappy and Bernstein between January and October of 1986. The last correspondence between Snappy and Bernstein was on October 16, 1986, when Snappy sent a letter to Bernstein supplying a more legible copy of the rental agreement. On March 18, 1988, seventeen months after its last communication with Gassett or Bernstein, Snappy instituted a suit against Gassett to collect this sum.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[348,758,1123,493]]]'>On March 25, 1988, in an affidavit of due diligence, Snappy’s process server, Robert Irwin, stated that he had attempted to serve Gassett at her last known address in Las Vegas, 4600 W. Sirius, #1310. According to the affidavit, service was attempted on March 22, 1988. The affidavit, a predominately pre-printed form, states: “Affiant further attempted normal and routine checks of telephone directories for the communities nearby for the last known address of Defendant, vehicle registration and Post Office forwarding orders.” Irwin also noted on the form that he spoke with the manager of the apartment complex who told him that Gassett no longer lived at the Sirius address.</p>

    <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.7",524,[348,1439,1122,302]]]'>Gassett did not respond, and on July 22, 1988, the district court entered a default judgment against Gassett. The judgment was recorded with the Clark County Recorder on September 2, 1988. The judgment ordered Gassett to pay Snappy $7,962.56 for the deficiency on the car, along with $1,721.36 in interest, $159.00 for the costs of the suit, and $1,250.00 in attorney’s fees.</p>
    <p id="b524-9" data-blocks='[["BL_524.8",524,[346,1758,1124,575]]]'>Gassett first learned of the lawsuit on December 22, 1993. While Gassett was trying to buy a house, the title company found the judgment on her credit history. On January 11, 1994, Gassett filed a motion for order to set aside judgment and to quash service. Gassett argued that the district court should set aside the default judgment because it was obtained through extrinsic fraud and because Snappy did not use due diligence in finding Gassett. Gassett, by sworn affidavit, stated that she had lived in Las Vegas since 1981 and that her address and telephone number had always been listed in the telephone book. In her motion, Gassett also claimed that service was ineffective. Gassett further stated in her affidavit that she never received any notice of any kind regarding the suit.</p>

In so doing, the district court found that Snappy had exercised due diligence in attempting to locate Gassett and that Snappy had committed no extrinsic fraud. Additionally, the district court found that neither Gassett nor her counsel had made an appearance in the action pursuant to NRCP 55(b). The district court also found that Gassett had made a general appearance by filing her motion to set aside the judgment, thereby waiving any complaints about improper service.</p>

With this in mind, we approve the observation . . . that a default judgment normally must be viewed as available only when the adversary process has been halted because of an essentially unresponsive party.” (Citation omitted.) This court has also stated “that a trial court’s exercise of discretion in granting or denying a motion to set aside a default judgment will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.” Minton v. Roliff, <a href="/nev/86/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="86 Nev. 478" data-case-ids="4838461" data-case-paths="/nev/86/0478-01">86 Nev. 478</a>, 481, <a href="/nev/86/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="86 Nev. 478" data-case-ids="4838461" data-case-paths="/nev/86/0478-01">471 P.2d 209</a>, 210 (1970) (citations omitted).

The defective service rendered the district court’s personal jurisdiction over Gassett invalid and the judgment against her void. For a judgment to be void, there must be a defect in the court’s authority to enter judgment through either lack of personal jurisdiction or jurisdiction over subject matter in the suit. Puphal v.

    <p id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[343,1133,1123,621]]]'>Snappy argues that the defective service on Gassett is irrelevant because she waived her right to complain of such jurisdictional issues. In its order, the district court found that Gassett made a general appearance through her motion to set aside the default judgment. In her motion, Snappy claims, Gassett requested relief additional to that necessary to protect her from defective service, thus waiving her right to complain about the defect. The district court relied on Doyle v. Jorgensen, <a href="/nev/82/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="82 Nev. 196" data-case-ids="8555954" data-case-paths="/nev/82/0196-01">82 Nev. 196</a>, <a href="/nev/82/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="82 Nev. 196" data-case-ids="8555954" data-case-paths="/nev/82/0196-01">414 P.2d 707</a> (1966). In <em>Doyle, </em>this court assessed whether a defendant who was not properly served prior to an entry of default made a general appearance when he sought relief for the improper service and also sought relief on the basis of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
