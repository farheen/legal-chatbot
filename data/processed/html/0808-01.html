Minor-plaintiff suffered a fracture of his lower leg which required a closed reduction under anesthesia. The procedure had to be repeated in approximately two weeks when the reduction lost acceptable alignment.

Appellants’ post-trial motion asserted that the jury’s verdict as to damages was against the weight of the evidence and sought a new trial as to damages only. Appellee contended that the court erred in precluding evidence that the minor-plaintiff was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. The court granted the motion for new trial on both liability and damages as to all parties and did not rule with respect to Appellee’s contention that she should have been allowed to produce evidence regarding the non-usage of a helmet. Appellants then took the present appeals.</p>

Appellants, acting as third-party defendants, assert that judgment should be entered in their favor as the jury found that they were not liable and there was no basis for a new trial on liability. In a “statement in lieu of opinion,” the court, in apparent reconsideration of the position taken at the post-trial stage, stated its opinion that Appellants were correct that there was no need to retry the issue of liability and also, that the order granting a new trial should not apply to Appellants as additional defendants. We agree. Although, as the discussion that follows should demonstrate, there was a definite need to grant a new trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> we see no reason that a new trial needs to include the issue of liability.</p>

We note that although, at one time, it was not permissible to grant a new trial limited to damages, that rule has given way to a more pragmatic approach. Now, “[a] new trial limited to the issue of damages will be granted where: (1) the issue of damages is not ‘intertwined’ with the issue of liability; and (2) where the issue of liability has been ‘fairly determined’ or is ‘free from doubt.’ <em>Gagliano v.

The jury was clearly not in doubt as to the negligence of the defendants or as to the contributory negligence of Ms. Kiser. The jury completely exonerated two of the defendants and apportioned the negligence 60%-20%-20% among Mr. Schulte and the Trinneses. The jury found in the special interrogatories that Ms. Kiser was contributorily negligent, but also found that this negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about her death.

The liability issue was fairly litigated and, given the arguments of both parties, would appear to have been fairly resolved by the jury’s conclusion that both the minor-plaintiff and Appellee were equally responsible for the accident while the additional defendants were zero percent responsible. Further, we fail to see how the minor-plaintiffs injuries bear upon the issue of responsibility for the accident. As such, we see no need to re-litigate the issue of liability. Moreover, the jury’s verdict here does not meet the definition of “compromise verdict” as set forth in the above passage. Here, the jury did not return a verdict in a lesser amount than if the liability issue was free of doubt. Rather, the jury seemingly carefully concluded that both parties were equally at fault, but then, either out of confusion or some other unexplained reason, simply disregarded the uncontroverted evidence as to the minor-plaintiffs injuries and refused to award any damages.</p>

We note that Appellee argues that the court erred in granting a new trial simply because the jury awarded no damages. However, Ap-pellee did not hie an appeal from the order granting a new trial. As such, Appellee has no standing to assert that the granting of a new trial was error as one is obliged to take an appeal from an order that aggrieves the party to be eligible for the granting of relief. <em>See Holteen v.

Although Appellee did not file a notice of appeal, and therefore is precluded from arguing that the court’s order was incorrect, Ap-pellee certainly has standing to assert that the court was correct in granting a new trial on both liability and damages, even if the trial court has changed its position on the matter post-appeal. Moreover, Appellee is free to argue that the court's order was correct on grounds other than those the trial court originally relied upon.</p>
