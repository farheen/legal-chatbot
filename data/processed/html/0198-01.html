    <p id="b256-24" data-blocks='[["BL_256.21",256,[997,1027,756,803]]]'>Joseph Cobb brought this action for re-plevin in the trial court to recover possession of a tow truck and a van. James Bowman, who does business as J &amp; J Towing, counterclaimed for towing fees and storage charges. Following a bench trial, the trial judge ruled in favor of Bowman on the complaint and awarded him $380.00 for towing charges on the counterclaim. The judge denied Bowman any recovery for storage fees, however, apparently because she believed that Bowman had not explicated the basis for the amount demanded. On appeal, Bowman contends that the judge committed reversible error by denying him storage fees. We reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>

    <p id="b256-26" data-blocks='[["BL_256.23",256,[993,1970,756,611]]]'>The facts relevant to the narrow issue to which this appeal pertains are largely undisputed. In June, 1991, Cobb was storing a van and three tow trucks in an alley in northwest Washington on property owned by Earl Vincent. The agreed rental was $200 per month. Cobb testified that Vincent developed an “attitude,” perhaps because Cobb was not timely in paying a portion of his rent. Vincent changed the locks on the property, thus preventing Cobb from gaining access to the trucks and the van. Vincent then had the vehicles ticketed by the police.</p>
    <p id="b256-27" data-blocks='[["BL_256.24",256,[992,2610,752,132]],["BL_257.1",257,[169,232,753,275]]]'>On July 22, 1991, at Vincent’s request, Bowman’s employees towed the four vehicles to Bowman’s lot. Four days later, Vincent <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>advised Cobb by letter where his van and trucks had been taken. Cobb visited Bowman and asked for the return of his vehicles. Bowman advised Cobb, however, that Cobb would first be required to pay towing and storage charges.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[169,528,754,603]]]'>Cobb took no further action until January 7, 1992, when he instituted an action for replevin. He initially sought possession only of two of the vehicles, a 1976 yellow and green Ford truck and a 1983 blue and gold van. Bowman counterclaimed, <em>inter alia, </em>for towing and storage fees. On February 27, 1992, after Cobb had filed a satisfactory undertaking, the court issued a writ of replevin. On March 13,1992, pursuant to the writ, the 1976 Ford truck and the 1983 van were recovered by the United States Marshal and returned to Cobb.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[170,1160,754,701]]]'>Subsequently, Cobb apparently amended his complaint<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to seek return of the two remaining trucks, a blue 1973 Ford and a brown 1975 Chevrolet. The case came on for trial on February 22, 1993. Cobb’s principal claim at trial was that all four vehicles had been lawfully parked on Vincent’s property and improperly ticketed, and that he was entitled to the return of the two remaining trucks without paying towing or storage charges. Bowman responded that he had lawfully towed vehicles which had been ticketed by the police and that he was entitled to compensation for storage and towing for all four of them.</p>
    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[171,1890,752,370]],["BL_257.7",257,[970,231,755,224]]]'>At the conclusion of the trial, the judge found that although Cobb had established that he held title to the two trucks which had not been returned to him, he had not proved that he had a right to their <em>possession </em>— the essence of an action for replevin. She also found, somewhat inconsistently, that Bowman had not sufficiently established any “authentication of those particular vehicles and their relationship to this alley or anything else.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The judge thus awarded no relief to either party with respect to the two trucks which had remained on Bowman’s lot.</p>
    <p id="b257-11" data-blocks='[["BL_257.12",257,[970,501,759,847]]]'>The judge found that with respect to the two vehicles which had been recovered by the United States Marshal, Bowman had proved that he was entitled to towing fees of $380.00, but not to any storage charges. She noted that the defense had produced invoices which reflected charges of $3,870.00 for each of these vehicles (and $8,715.00 each for the two tow trucks remaining on Bowman’s premises) but commented that “there is no evidence or records of how that number was arrived at. It just seems to be arrived at.” After awarding Bowman $380.00 in towing charges on the yellow and green truck and the blue and gold van, the judge explained that “[t]he other monies the court cannot find the basis [for], and therefore cannot make an award in this matter.”</p>
    <p id="b257-12" data-blocks='[["BL_257.13",257,[970,1396,756,467]]]'>Bowman filed a timely appeal from the court’s failure to award him storage fees. In his brief in this court, he states that he does not challenge the judge’s ruling that his proof failed with respect to the two trucks not recovered by the U.S. Marshal. Cobb has not cross-appealed, and the only question before us is whether storage fees were properly denied with respect to the replevied blue and gold van and yellow and green truck.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="AGO" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[186,337,757,495]]]'>The blue and gold van and the yellow and green Ford truck were stored by Bowman from July 22,1991 to March 13, 1992, a total of 236 days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> At $15.00 per day, Bowman was entitled to a total of $3540 for storage of each of these vehicles. In his counterclaim, Bowman claimed that precise amount— $3540 — with respect to the Ford truck and $3500.with respect to the van (the latter amount apparently representing a $40 mathematical error to his own detriment).</p>
    <p id="A57I" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[184,855,756,954]]]'>At trial, Bowman testified that he was entitled to $7315.00 in storage and towing charges on the two vehicles. As we have noted, the daily storage charges, at $15.00 per day, were $3540.00 for each vehicle, or a total of $7080.00. There are also additional charges for the van of $110.00 for towing and $25.00 for “extra work,” totalling $135.00. There are additional charges for the Ford truck of $150.00 for towing and $65.00 for “extra work,” for a total of $215.00. If these additional charges ($135.00 + $215.00 = $350.00) are added to the charge for daily storage, the total — $7080.00 + $350.00 — is $7430.00, or $115.00 <em>over </em>the amount demanded by Bowman. Although Bowman’s calculations may have been less than arithmetically perfect, it is obvious from the record that storage was calculated at $15.00 per vehicle per day — the minimum charge reflected on each invoice.</p>

The invoice for the Chevrolet identifies the storage charge of $8715.00 as of February 22,1993. The invoice for the Ford has the same amount. On February 22, 1993, the two vehicles had been in Bowman’s possession for 582 days. Since 581 x 15 = 8715, Bowman seems to have made a $15.00 error in Cobb’s favor, perhaps because 1992 was a leap year and Bowman failed to charge for one day of storage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In any event, the storage charge was obviously calculated at $15.00 per day as to all four of the vehicles.</p>

We recognize that the courts of this jurisdiction operate under the adversary system, and that it is not the function of the judge to carry out the responsibilities of a litigant’s attorney.
