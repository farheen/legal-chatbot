      <em> </em>The newly-discovered evidence on which Appellant relied was a copy of notes taken during a 1990 lecture regarding jury selection that was given to Philadelphia prosecutors by Bruce Sagel, who was then an Assistant District Attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office. The notes were taken by Gavin Lentz, a former Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney, who had attended Mr. Sagel’s lecture. Based on these notes, Appellant sought to have his convictions and sentences vacated under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections <a id="p718" href="#p718" data-label="718" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*718</a>1,6, 9, 10, 13, and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b758-4" data-blocks='[["BL_758.4",758,[185,377,757,1547]]]'>In Appellant’s view, the notes constituted evidence of a “culture of discrimination” within the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office, whereby the prosecutors deliberately sought to exclude African-Americans from serving on a jury and to use improper means to avoid a <em>Batson </em>challenge. (Appellant’s Brief at 15). To reinforce his interpretation of the notes, Appellant invoked a videotape of a training seminar on jury selection, which had been given in 1987 by Jack McMahon, who was then a Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney. In the tape, Mr. McMahon explicitly advocated the use of discriminatory practices during jury selection. <em>See Commonwealth v. Basemore, </em><a href="/pa/560/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="560 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="95802" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0258-01">560 Pa. 258</a>, <a href="/a2d/744/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="744 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="11490920,95802" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/0717-01,/pa/560/0258-01">744 A.2d 717</a>, 730-731 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12 (2000) (providing excerpts of the videotaped transcript and condemning the practices described therein as “flout[ing] constitutional principles in a highly flagrant manner”). Appellant argued that similarity between the McMahon videotape and the Sagel lecture, as reflected in Mr. Lentz’s notes, revealed a culture of racial discrimination in the jury selection process and disregard for the <em>Batson </em>holding, which was manifest throughout the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office.</p>

Because Appellant’s petition was filed within 60 days of Mr. Sagel’s testimony as to Mr. Lentz’s authorship of the notes, Appellant contends that his petition was therefore timely. Appellant merely states — without benefit of supporting argument — that, even if he had exercised due diligence, he could not have obtained the notes and thus could not have presented his claim prior to Mr. Sagel’s testimony.

The after-discovered “fact” on which Appellant relies is the contention, based on the Sagel and McMahon lectures, of a policy of racial discrimination in jury selection in the District Attorney’s Office. The investigative report that discussed both lectures and concluded therefrom that a discriminatory policy was extant in the District Attorney’s Office, was published in Philadelphia Magazine in June 1997, and thus was public knowledge prior to the filing of Appellant’s supplemental petition on October 24, 1997, in support of his first request for PCRA relief, some eight years before Appellant filed the instant PCRA petition. Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, Mr. Lentz’s lecture notes are properly characterized as another source for the claim of a racially discriminatory policy in jury selection in the District Attorney’s Office.

Appellant’s implication that Mr. Lentz’s notes were comparable to the evidence of racial bias in jury selection in <em>Miller-El </em>is untenable. The <em>Miller-El </em>Court noted the "extensive evidence” relating to jury selection procedures offered by the appellant to support his contention of racial discrimination in jury selection, both during his individual prosecution and as a general policy in the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office. <em><a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">at 330</a>, <a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">123 S.Ct. 1029</a>.
