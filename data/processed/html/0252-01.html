After Upton sued for negligence, Henderer offered him a judgment of $10,000 under Rule 68, which Upton rejected. At trial Henderer admitted negligence and the only issues put to the jury were whether his conduct had proximately caused injuries to Upton, and if so, the amount of damages to be awarded. Since the parties stipulated to $2,000 worth of damage to Upton’s car, the judge directed a verdict for Upton to that extent. The judge further treated as unopposed, and granted, Henderer’s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude evidence of purported wage losses by Upton. Following a trial in which competing medical experts opined on whether the accident had aggravated Upton’s pre-exist-ing back malady, the jury found that Upton had not met his burden of proof on causation and awarded him nothing. Hen-derer then moved for costs including fees paid to his expert witnesses, in light of his earlier offer of judgment exceeding Upton’s recovery. The judge denied him witness fees except to the extent provided by <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 1821">28 U.S.C. § 1821</a>(b), relying chiefly on this court’s decision in <em>Talley v.

When, as here, a party seeks a new trial because the damage award is against the weight of the evidence, we will reverse only (a) if the amount — or absence — of an award “evidences prejudice, passion, or partiality on the part of the jury[,]” (b) “where the verdict appears to be an oversight [or] mistake, or [to rest on] consideration of an improper element,” or (c) where “the award is contrary to all reason.” <em>Barron v.

As he concedes, the jury heard — and implicitly discounted — the evidence he provided that he had worked strenuously to build his security and safe-repair business in the years just before the accident (though taking no salary), but was sidelined entirely and could earn nothing after the accident.
