Furthermore, while the instant case does not present the issue of allegedly exempt property, we previously suggested, and now hold, “that the period for <em>all </em>appeals under § 47-2403 runs from the mailing of the assessment, the clause ‘after payment . . .’ to be read as ‘provided payment has been made.’ ” <em><a href="/a2d/346/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="346 A.2d 740" data-case-ids="8072312" data-case-paths="/a2d/346/0740-01">Id.</a> </em>at 743 n.7 (emphasis added).</p>
