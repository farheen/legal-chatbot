PLC is a Mexican garment manufacturing company, with its business headquarters in Mexico City, Mexico, and is owned and operated by Carlos Sandoval. Mothers Work, a Pennsylvania corporation with headquarters in Philadelphia, is a “knock off” maternity garment company that produces clothing by copying the designs of other leading manufacturers.</p>

Williams was asked to locate the appropriate mills and manufacturing centers in Mexico City.</p>

With approval of Mothers Work, and following Mothers Work’s inspection of PLC’s facilities, Ap-pellees entered into a joint venture for the manufacture of garments pursuant to orders placed by Mothers Work. Mothers Work approved the hiring of an on-site quality control inspector for CIK and PLC, and also interviewed and hired its own inspector.</p>

Mothers Work placed its orders for fabric and garments by purchase order, telephone, fax, and some e-mail communications. When garments were delivered to Mothers Work, invoices were issued by CIK or PLC. According to Williams, Appellees produced about 150,000 units for Mothers Work in 1999, about 500,000 units in 2000, and about 200,000 units in the early months of 2001. (N.T.

There was an established course of dealing between the parties regarding the manufacturing process and regarding the ordering of garments. (See Finding of Fact #7 a-i). Said course of dealing was an intricate and specific process that was followed for two years, and it established the terms of the oral agreement between the parties pursuant to U.C.C. § 2-208(a). [Quoting U.C.C. § 2-208(a)]. In addition, the course of dealings for payment for ordered and manufactured, but unused[,] fabric and findings was also clearly established.

The agreement was that [Mothers Work] would take and pay for the fabric and findings or that said fabric and findings would be used in future [Mothers Work] orders.

First, the trial court made extensive findings of fact, which we find are supported by the record, concerning the detailed specifications set forth by Mothers Work concerning the size, color, feel, and composition of the goods, and the related fabric and findings. Indeed, it is undisputed that the garments were designed to be as identical as possible to garments made by other manufacturers and already on the market in the United States. Contrary to Mothers Work’s argument that this fact makes the goods non-unique and thus not specially manufactured (see, <em>e.g., </em>Appellant’s Brief at 19 (asserting that the trial court “lost sight of the undisputed ... fact that the garments manufactured for Mothers Work were manufactured to be knock-offs”)), we find the peculiar nature of the specifications— to be “knock-offs” — idiosyncratically ties these goods to Mothers Work, a self-described “ ‘knock off maternity company that designs maternity clothing by copying the designs of other leading manufacturers.” (Appellant’s Brief at 7.) Thus, Mothers Work does not dispute, nor can it reasonably dispute, that these goods were specially manufactured for it in the sense that they were made specifically for a particular buyer, Mothers Work. <em>See Colorado Carpet Installation, </em><a href="/p2d/668/1384-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="668 P.2d 1384" data-case-ids="10431934" data-case-paths="/p2d/668/1384-01">668 P.2d at 1390</a>; <em>Webcor Packaging Corp., </em><a href="/f3d/158/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="158 F.3d 354" data-case-ids="11668259" data-case-paths="/f3d/158/0354-01">158 F.3d at 357</a>.</p>

The trial court found, however, that “there was credible testimony by Carlos Sandoval that these garments could not be sold in Mexico; the feel, fit and sizing were not appropriate for such market as they were specially manufactured for [Mothers Work] and the American market.” (Memorandum Opinion, 9/27/05, at 4.)

As the trial court explained, <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>“there was no evidence of any agreement relative to [Mothers Work paying] for any profit on unused special order fabric” because “the course of dealings between the parties was such that profits were not provided for if fabric was not used in production.” (Memorandum Opinion, 9/27/05, at 3-4.) Appellees concede as much when they state in their brief that the “standard practice” agreed upon by the parties was that fabric “not used for 90 days would be paid for by [Mothers Work] <em>at cost. </em>” (Appellees’ Brief at 12 (emphasis added).) Indeed, as Mothers Work argues in its reply brief, to award Appellees lost profits under these circumstances would actually put them in a better position than under the terms of the contract. (Response Brief for Cross-Appellee/Reply Brief for Appellant at 2.) Thus, the trial court properly denied Appellees’ request for lost profits.</p>
