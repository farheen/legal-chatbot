(“Luk-ens” or the “Company”) announced that Bethlehem Steel Corporation had agreed to pay $30 per share (consisting of a combination of cash and stock) in exchange for all of the Lukens common stock. This announcement followed an initial agreement between Lukens and Bethlehem to merge at a price of $25 per share and a subsequent proposal from a third party to pay $28 per share. The Lukens stockholders voted to approve the Lukens/Bethle-hem transaction, which was consummated on May 29,1998.</p>

I entered an order consolidating them for all purposes in March 1998. At that time, plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. They amended that pleading on May 26, 1998, only days before the stockholder vote. That complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the Lukens board of directors (essentially a <em>Revlon </em>claim that the directors failed to seek the best value reasonably available for Luk-ens) and claimed that Bethlehem is liable for aiding and abetting those alleged breaches. That complaint made no claim that the proxy materials sent to stockholders in connection with the proposed merger were false or misleading in any respect. Plaintiffs never sought any form of injunc-tive relief in connection with the transaction.</p>

I will also dismiss the claim of aiding and abetting made against Bethlehem as unsupported by the well-pleaded allegations of the Complaint.

The Director Defendants did not take steps to implement these proposals and later renewed the Company’s poison pill. The Complaint quotes letters from several dissatisfied stockholders and implies that a proxy contest at the 1998 annual meeting was a possibility.

In the merger, each Lukens shareholder would have the right to elect to receive the consideration in cash, subject to a maximum total cash payout equal to 62% of the total consideration.

I note, however, that the merger agreement included a “no solicitation” clause, thus preventing the Lukens board from soliciting a competing takeover offer. The no solicitation clause was connected to the customary “fiduciary out,” allowing the board to adequately inform itself and take action on any unsolicited “superior proposal” from a third party. Upon receipt of a superior proposal, the Lukens board was, however, obliged to notify Bethlehem in writing of the terms and conditions of that proposal and could not accept the superior proposal until the fifth business day following Bethlehem’s receipt of that written notice.</p>

The Complaint criticizes the Director Defendants’ response to the “carve up,” alleging that they should have refused to go forward with the merger in order to “seek to extract the complete value of Lukens from both Bethlehem and Allegheny.” Further, it is alleged that the Director Defendants’ failures to act “enabled Bethlehem to scuttle an active bidding contest,” thus causing Lukens’s stockholders to receive less than they would have received “had an open and fair sale process for Lukens taken place.”</p>

Paragraph 11 states that “Alexander, Dammeyer, Dunnigan, Gross, Helton, Nelson, Price, Thomas and Tippett are directors of Lukens and along with Van Sant comprise all of the members of the Luk-ens’s Board of Directors (‘the Board’).” Paragraph 12 then alleges that Van Sant was Lukens’s Chairman and CEO for five years before the merger. What is missing is any allegation of fact that a majority of the Director Defendants either stood on both sides of the merger or were dominated and controlled by someone who did. Indeed, only Van Sant (who, as Lukens’s Chairman and CEO, was paid a sizeable <a id="p729" href="#p729" data-label="729" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*729</a>severance benefit package in the merger) is even alleged to have an interest in the merger different than that of the Lukens stockholders as a whole.</p>

First, they point to evidence of stockholder dissatisfaction with the Director Defendants during 1997, due to the Company’s poor performance, and the possibility of a proxy contest at the 1998 annual stockholder meeting. From this, they infer that the Director Defendants’ conduct in negotiating the sale of Lukens was improperly motivated, as shown by the Director Defendants’ alleged decision to “singlet ] out Bethlehem and Allegheny ... for merger discussions.” They then allege in a wholly con-elusory fashion that “[djriving the Director Defendants’ adamant goal to make a deal with Bethlehem was not what was in the best interest of Lukens’ stockholders, but, rather, avoiding an upcoming Lukens’s annual meeting at which they would have to report and account for their mismanagement resulting in over two consecutive years of losses and face a possible proxy contest.” Second, the Complaint makes the absurdly complicated and ineffective allegation that “the Director Defendants, with Bethlehem’s urging and cooperation, structured both [merger agreements] to favor Lukens’ management that had done Bethlehem’s bidding by rewarding them in honoring their ‘golden parachutes’ from Lukens in full.” Incongruously, the Complaint nowhere alleges facts showing that any of the employment contracts between Lukens and its managers, or the change of control provisions of those contracts, were invalid or otherwise unenforceable.</p>

As to the first contention, there is no logical force to the suggestion that otherwise independent, disinterested directors of a corporation would act disloyally or in bad faith and agree to a sale of their company “on the cheap” merely because they perceived some dissatisfaction with their performance among the stockholders or because of the possibility that a third of their number might face opposition for reelection at the next annual stockholders meeting. Plainly, there is no allegation of an improper entrenchment motive in these facts.

According to the Complaint, the Director Defendants pursued merger discussions for a year or more before agreeing to a merger on a price term ($25 per share in cash and securities) that, although not the best value ultimately attainable, is not alleged to have been inadequate or unfair. One week after Lukens announced this transaction, Allegheny, conclusively undeterred from bidding, first publicly announced an offer to buy Lukens for $28 per share in cash and stated that it would be willing to enter into a merger agreement substantially <a id="p730" href="#p730" data-label="730" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*730</a>identical to the one signed by Lukens and Bethlehem.

I find that, assuming that <em>Revlon </em>is implicated, the Complaint must still be dismissed. I nevertheless note that although there is no case directly on point, I cannot understand how the Director Defendants were <em>not </em>obliged, in the circumstances, to seek out the best price reasonably available. The defendants argue that because over 30% of the merger consideration was shares of Bethlehem common stock, a widely held company without any controlling shareholder, <em>Revlon </em>and <em>QVC </em>do not apply. I disagree. Whether 62% or 100% of the consideration was to be in cash, the directors were obliged to take reasonable steps to ensure that the shareholders received the best price available because, in any event, for a substantial majority of the then-current shareholders, "there is no long run.” <em>TW Servs., Inc. v. </em>SWT <em>Acquisition Corp., </em>Del.

I do not agree with the defendants that <em>Santa Fe, </em>in which shareholders tendered 33% of their shares for cash and exchanged the remainder for common stock, controls a situation in which over 60% of the consideration is cash. The Supreme Court has not set out a black line rule explaining what percentage of the consideration can be cash without triggering <em>Revlon. </em>I take for granted, however, that a cash offer for 95% of a company’s shares, for example, even if the other 5% will be exchanged for the shares of a widely held corporation, will constitute a change of corporate control. Until instructed otherwise, I believe that purchasing more than 60% achieves the same result.</p>
