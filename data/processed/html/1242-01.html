It was requested that the case “be set for final hearing, and that he be given an opportunity to urge the nonpatentability of the claim to Elder.” The record indicates that at some time Pearson sought to take testimony on the question of inoperativeness and that this was denied by the examiner whose decision in that respect was affirmed by the commissioner.

    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[121,330,1326,144]]]'>In passing upon the motion to dissolve, the examiner (evidently following the order in which the issues were presented in Pearson’s brief before him) said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[119,501,1330,283]]]'>Under ground (lb), Pearson contends that “directly beating the disk” denotes “subjecting the disk throughout the entire adhesive-covered face thereof to direct contact with the heating medium” and that Elder has not disclosed means for such direct heating. On page 24 of his brief, Pearson, further contends that “directly heating” in the light of the Pearson disclosure means “presenting the adhesive face of the disk to the heating elements so that the heat radiating therefrom will contact with the disk and soften the adhesive.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[121,795,1328,369]]]'>On page 8 of his brief, Pearson contends that “directly heating” in the light •of his disclosure means that the disk “is subjected directly to the heat radiating from the heating elements” as distinguished from heating “by contact with some element which is heated.” In Pearson’s disclosure there is nothing to warrant the narrow interpretation for which Pearson contends. There is nothing in Pearson’s disclosure or claims to interpret “directly heating” in claim 6 more narrowly than excluding only heating directly the cap or the cap cushion for the purpose of indirectly heating the spot. Direct heating may be effected by radiation or conduction.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-7" data-blocks='[["BL_565.7",565,[122,1175,1327,157]]]'>Thus in the disclosure of Elder the hot pad is clearly a means for indirectly heating the spot, but the hot presser foot 92 (Figure 10), the hot punch of Figure 12, and the heating element 503, all are individual means for directly heating the spot.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-8" data-blocks='[["BL_565.8",565,[122,1344,1328,240]]]'>There is nothing in Pearson to support the contention that “directly heating 1he disk” as set forth in the count means directly heating the adhesive-coated face of the disk. Claims 3, 5, and 12 of Pearson are expressly limited to applying head directly to the coated side of the disk. The omission of such limitation in Pearson’s claim 6 must be assumed to be deliberate in the absence of a basis for a contrary implication in other terms of the claim.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-9" data-blocks='[["BL_565.9",565,[124,1596,1326,156]]]'>In view of Elder, page 25, lines 5 to 9 (where it is stated: “* * * the shoulder 232 is of very slight dimension, being simply large enough to retain the spot and allow its ready removal”), it cannot be said that Elder does not heat the entire surface of the disk. Furthermore, the count is not so limited.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-11" data-blocks='[["BL_565.10",565,[124,1763,1327,201]]]'>Even if it be assumed, as Pearson has contended, that only three of Elder’s four heating means apply heat indirectly to the spot, that fact would be immaterial since the count does not exclude heating means in addition to the direct heating means. Actually, as indicated above, Elder shows only one indirect heating means and three direct heating means.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-12" data-blocks='[["BL_565.11",565,[124,1973,1328,241]]]'>On page 35, lines 25 to 27 of Elder it is stated: “Thus, by suitable heating means associated with the conveyor and/or the spot transfer dial, the adhesives will be softened and rendered adhesive in the transfer dial.” Even if Elder had illustrated this description by showing heated carriers 127 which heated the spots by contact with the edges of the spots, such means would clearly be a means for directly heating the spots.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b565-13" data-blocks='[["BL_565.12",565,[124,2225,1326,73]]]'>It is therefore held that Elder has disclosed means for “directly heating the disk” and can properly make the count as to those terms.</blockquote>
