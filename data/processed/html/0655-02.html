Trooper Danko interviewed B.M. in the presence of his father. The child told the trooper that while visiting Appellant’s home with eight-year-old G.W., Appellant’s grandson, Appellant performed oral sex on him in the presence of G.W. Trooper Danko then interviewed G.W., who stated that Appellant did perform oral sex upon B.M. and that his grandfather had told him to stand guard so they would not be discovered. G.W. also told the trooper that Appellant had performed oral sex on him once when he was five years old and once when he was four years old. Trooper Danko contemporaneously recorded the boys’ statements verbatim at the time of the interviews.

Defense counsel was also put on notice by the statement that the declarant was twelve years old or younger. In fact, on September 6, 1990, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent the Commonwealth from introducing the statement into evidence in the event that the victim denied having made the statement. In that motion, appellant stated that the victim was eight years old at the time the statement was made and stated that the defense believed that the Commonwealth intended to introduce the statement at trial. Thus, his own actions to exclude use of the statement as substantive evidence demonstrate that he had sufficient notice that the statement could be admitted as a hearsay exception under the Tender Years Hearsay Act.

As with all exceptions to the rule forbidding the admission of hearsay evidence, once the statement or other evidence is accepted as an exception to the hearsay rule, then that statement or evidence becomes substantive evidence and, if relevant, is admissible in the trial of one accused of criminal conduct. The Tender Years Hearsay Act provides a hearsay exception in Pennsylvania and G.W.’s statement is admissible as substantive evidence in the trial of appellant, notwithstanding the rule espoused by this Court in <em>Lively, <a href="/pa/530/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="530 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1833065" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0464-01">supra.</a></em>

In view of the fact that the child’s statement was provided and the child's age at the time the statement was known, defense counsel, who is charged with knowing the law of this Commonwealth as an attorney admitted to practice in the Commonwealth, should have been on notice that such statement could be used under the Tender Years Hearsay Act at the time such information was first provided by the prosecution.</p>
