The court in <em>Yudacufski </em>followed the reasoning in the Schuylkill County case of <em>Seltzer Coal Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>72 Sch.L.R. 29 (1976), where the president judge considered four factors in granting a change in venue: (1) whether the jury’s monetary evaluation of culm banks, considered to be ecological and economic eyesores, was a substantial part of the award; (2) whether the residents were biased against coal operators because of the culm banks; (3) whether there might be prejudicial pre-trial publicity; and (4) whether after ten years of litigation, a different jurisdiction would minimize further delays by avoiding the issue of local bias from culm banks. Our Supreme Court concluded that all four factors existed in <em>Yuda-cufski </em>and held that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to follow the precedent established in <em>Seltzer.</em>

Finally, although this case has already been delayed for more than ten years, that alone is an insufficient basis for the grant of a change in venue.
