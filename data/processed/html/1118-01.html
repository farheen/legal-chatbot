Trial was held before the Honorable Paul Ribner. At trial, attorney Richard P. Haaz represented Dr. Yaros. Counsel for the University was John Orlando. Also present was Erika Gross, who was the liability administrator for the University. Testimony began on January 26, 1998. On that date, the University offered Dr. Yaros a settlement offer of $750,-<a id="p1120" href="#p1120" data-label="1120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1120</a>000.00. Attorney Haaz informed Attorney Orlando that Dr. Yaros would accept $1.5 million in settlement up until the time she testified, after which she would not settle for any amount. The trial continued, two defense witnesses took the stand, and then Dr. Yaros testified.’ No settlement was reached at that time.</p>

Attorney Orlando made the offer to Attorney Haaz during a ten minute recess prior to closing arguments. At the close of the conversation Attorney Orlando told Attorney Haaz “you’ve got to get back to me.” When he made this statement, Attorney Orlando looked at the clock and placed his palms sideward. No time limitations regarding the offer were communicated, nor was it indicated that the offer was only open until closing arguments began. Attorney Haaz stated he would talk to his client now. After the offer was made Attorney Haaz left the courtroom to speak to his client. Attorney Orlando also left the courtroom to go to the men’s restroom. Attorney Haaz returned to the courtroom without Dr. Yaros, who was in the restroom. Attorney Haaz asked the trial court for two minutes to speak to his client before closings, to which the court agreed. At that time Attorney Orlando assumed Attorney Haaz had not discussed the offer with Dr. Yaros. N.T., Hearing, 1/12/99, at 68, 74-75. Upon Dr. Yaros’s return, Attorney Haaz did not confer with her and closing arguments commenced immediately. Earlier that day, Judge Ribner informed both counsel he expected closing arguments to be finished by 5:00 p.m. so he could charge the jury the next day. During the University’s closing, Dr. Yaros authorized Attorney Haaz to accept the offer. After the University ended its closing, Attorney Haaz gave his rebuttal. At a sidebar conference following closings Attorney Haaz stated Dr. Yaros accepted the University’s settlement offer. Attorney Orlando replied by stating, “I don’t know if it’s still there, judge.” N.T., Trial, 1/29/98, at 559. The next day, prior to jury deliberations Dr. Yaros orally moved to enforce the settlement. Judge Ribner denied the motion pending evidentiary hearings on the matter and the jury’s verdict. The jury came back with a defense verdict. Following trial, Dr. Yaros filed a Motion for Posh-Trial Relief and a Motion to Enforce Settlement. One evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Ribner. However, upon his retirement the case was reassigned to the Honorable Sandra Mazer Moss, who conducted hearings on January 12 and 15, 1999. On February 22, 1999, Judge Mazer Moss granted Dr. Yaros’s Motion to Enforce Settlement. This timely appeal followed.</p>

The offer by the University clearly extended beyond the end of counsels’ conversation, during the court recess when Attorney Haaz walked out of the courtroom to speak with his client about the settlement offer. A contrary intention was clearly indicated by Attorney Orlando when he ended the conversation with Attorney Haaz by stating “get back to me.” Thus, the time for acceptance by Dr. Yaros extended beyond the end of the conversation between the parties’ attorneys. The question that then arises is how long was the offer open. The University maintains it intended the offer was only open until the beginning of closing arguments, and such intention was clear. It submits that although Attorney Orlando did not articulate explicitly a definite time limit for Dr. Yaros’s acceptance, its intention was manifested by the fact closing arguments were imminent, the established pattern of including an event condition with a settlement offer, and the verbal and non-verbal expressions used.</p>

We find preposterous the University’s assertion that its intention regarding the time limitation of the offer was clear. The trial court made a factual determination that no time or event conditions were ever placed on the settlement offer. Here, the duration of the offer was not even clear to its trial counsel Attorney Orlando or its risk manager, Erika Gross.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After Dr. Yaros accepted the offer Attorney Orlando stated, “I don’t know if it’s still there, judge.” Certainly, if Attorney Orlando, the offeror, was unclear of whether the offer was still open after closing arguments were complete, it’s incredulous to argue the offeree, Dr. Yaros, was clearly aware that the offer would lapse once closing arguments began. Moreover, we reject the University’s claim that verbal and non-verbal conduct made the time limitation of the offer apparent. • The University argues Attorney Orlando’s statement “you’ve got to get back to me” can only be interpreted as “you’ve got to get back to me with an answer as soon as possible— which is, when we both come back into the courtroom: you from your discussion with your client and I from the Men’s Room, so we can conclude this negotiation in the next few minutes before closings.” University’s brief at 27. We will not reject the trial court’s findings in favor of such a strained interpretation of the statement, “you’ve got to get back to me,” or conduct like Attorney Haaz’s statement that he needed two minutes to speak with his client and Attorney Orlando’s non-verbal <a id="p1123" href="#p1123" data-label="1123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1123</a>act of looking at the clock and “putfting] [his] palms sidewards.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b1169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1169.4",1169,[122,384,754,1238]]]'>¶ 9 Additionally, the University makes much of the fact that Dr. Yaros had earlier during the trial imposed an event condition on a settlement offer. During trial Attorney Haaz informed Attorney Orlando that Dr. Yaros would accept a settlement in a certain dollar amount only up until the time she testified. The University now maintains this established a pattern of including an event condition with a settlement offer. While the prior course of dealings between the parties is instructive, in this case it cuts against the University’s argument. In the parties’ prior course of dealings, Dr. Yaros and her counsel explicitly informed the University of the event condition. There was no such explanation when the University made its offer just prior to closing arguments. Moreover, the offer remained open during the course of several witnesses’ testimony. Under such circumstances, the prior course of dealing between the parties did not establish closing argument was an event which would terminate the offer.</p>
    <p id="b1169-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1169.5",1169,[120,1670,753,731]]]'>¶ 10 The University next argues Dr. Ya-ros’s conduct constituted a rejection of the offer. Specifically, it maintains that because Attorney Haaz did not confer with Dr. Yaros when she returned to the courtroom just prior to closings and because Dr. Yaros participated in closing and rebuttal arguments without accepting the offer, it was justified in inferring she had in fact rejected the offer. The trial court found Dr. Yaros never rejected the offer. The court further rebuffed the University’s contention that it could infer its offer had been rejected when closing arguments commenced.</p>

Restatement (Contracts) § 36; <em>Smaligo v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/432/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="432 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="1919688" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0133-01">432 Pa. 133</a>, 139, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20577" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="247 A.2d 577">247 A.2d 577</a>, 580 (1968). In <em>Smaligo, </em>an insurance company made a settlement offer informing the offeree plaintiffs that proceeding forward with the case would be viewed as a rejection. The plaintiffs proceeded to arbitration. This Court agreed with the trial court that plaintiffs’ action clearly showed that they did not intend to accept the offer. Unlike <em>Smaligo, </em>this is not a situation where the offeree was placed on notice that certain conduct would constitute a rejection of the offer. While an offeree need not be put on specific notice that certain conduct will be viewed by the offeror as a rejection of the offer, not all conduct can justify an offeror in inferring that the offer has been rejected. In this case we can find no error in the trial court’s finding that the University was not justified in inferring that proceeding to closing arguments would constitute a rejection of the settlement offer. There is no <em>per se </em>rule that commencing with closing arguments constitutes a rejection of a settlement offer. Nor do we wish to create one here. It would produce a situation where an offeror would have the unfair advantage of unilaterally asserting after the offer has been accepted that an unspecified, undefined and uncommunicated event at trial constituted a rejection. Moreover, we agree with Dr. Yaros’s observation that since the University believed she had not had an opportunity to consult with her counsel and was unaware of the settlement offer, it would not be justified in inferring that proceeding to <a id="p1124" href="#p1124" data-label="1124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1124</a>closing arguments constituted a rejection of the offer. How the University could interpret the actions of Dr. Yaros and Attorney Haaz as a rejection of its offer when the University was under the impression Dr. Yaros was unaware of the offer at that time is beyond our understanding.</p>
    <p id="b1170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1170.4",1170,[190,659,767,816]]]'>¶ 12 The University finally argues the settlement offer lapsed because, as a matter of law, Dr. Yaros did not accept it within a reasonable amount of time.

      <em>Id. </em>at 438-439. After holding numerous evidentiary hearings, the trial court treated this issue as a question of fact, finding the time period was reasonable under the circumstances. The University believes this is a question of law because trials happen in the same manner every day in the sense that the significant events of trial such as opening arguments, the presentation of evidence, and closing arguments proceed in the same manner in every trial. While trials do commence in the same manner, “the course and nature of settlement negotiations varies greatly from case to case.” <em>Id. </em>at 440. There are individual circumstances distinct to this case, such as when and how the offer was made, which will not necessarily continually recur in other cases. Thus, we believe the trial court was correct in treating this as a question of fact.</p>

It maintains there is an urgency that accompanies a response when an offer is made during the course of trial, and in such a context the actual amount of minutes from offer to acceptance is irrelevant. In effect, the University maintains where an offer is made immediately before closing arguments it is unreasonable for the offer to stay open beyond the commencement of closings, which in this case occurred approximately ten minutes after the offer was made.</p>

University’s Brief, at 40. The University’s argument is misplaced because the trial court made its observation regarding the significance of closings to address the University’s argument that a rejection could be inferred when Dr. Yaros participated in closings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Whether or not closing arguments are significant trial events does not support the University’s contention that the occurrence of closing arguments automatically causes a settlement offer to lapse. There are many significant events during the course of a trial. Settlement offers are accepted at all stages of trial. Even assuming a closing argument is a significant trial event, such an occurrence does not necessarily determine whether an offeree accepted an offer within a reasonable period of time. It is but one consideration. Here, the trial court found the offer was accepted within a reasonable amount of time under the circumstances. We will not disturb that finding. Under the facts of this case, we cannot say the trial court erred in finding Dr. Yaros accepted the offer within a reasonable amount of time or such a finding was against the weight of the evidence. In conclusion, we find no abuse of discretion or error of law in the trial court’s enforcement of the settlement.</p>
