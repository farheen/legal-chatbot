Who <em>was </em>the first to see it, to understand its value, to give it shape and form, to bring it into notice and urge its adoption, is a question to which we shall shortly give our attention. At this point we are constrained to say that we cannot yield our assent to the argument, that the combination of the different parts or elements for attaining the object in view was so obvious as to merit no title to invention. Now that it has succeeded, it may seem very plain to any one that he could have done it as well. _ This is often the ease with inventions of the greatest merit. <em>It may be laid down, as a, general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that if a new combination and, arrangement of known elements produce a neto and beneficial result, never attained before, it is evidence of invention. </em>* * * [Last italics supplied.]</blockquote>

The notion that the parts of an invention must co-operate is certainly very persisting in the patent law, and it must correspond to some underlying idea. So far as it means that the whole complex claimed must be a unit in use, each part of which shall be necessary to the common result, we can understand it. So far as it rests upon an implied reference to mechanics, that is, that each part must give or take a strain, it seems to us a false lead. The test is more practical than that, because inventions are to answer human needs, and the elements may be mechanically inert. The co-operation of the means necessary to create an invention is to ho measured by the purpose to be fulfilled, not by the interaction of the parts. Each factor must indeed be a condition to that result, but the .whole may be a mere assemblage; the co-operation between them all may be no more than their necessary presence in a unit which shall answer a single purpose. Therefore, we can find little advantage in a discussion of what is or what is not an “aggregation.” * * *</blockquote>
