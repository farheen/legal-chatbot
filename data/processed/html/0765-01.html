Buonanno (Buo-nanno) challenges certain actions taken by the State Board of Elections (the board) following the general election held on November 4, 1980. Buonanno was one of the Democratic Party’s candidates for one of the three councilperson-at-large positions called for by the city of Cranston’s charter. He claims that the board erred when it (1) entertained a request for a recount of the votes cast for the at-large positions, (2) ruled that two voting machines had in fact malfunctioned with the result that the totals recorded for one of Buonanno’s opponents, Ann Mooradian (Mooradian), were distorted and incorrect, and (3) ordered the holding of a special election.</p>

When the polls closed and the voting-machine votes were tabulated, Buonanno was among the three top vote getters. At that moment, he was ninety-one votes ahead of Mooradian. The following day, Jeremiah S. Jeremiah (Jeremiah), chairman of the Republican City Committee in the city of Cranston, acting pursuant to G.L.1956 (1969 Reenactment) § 17-19-36, asked the board for a recount of the voting-machine votes as they related to the three at-large positions.</p>

All interested parties were present. The seals that had been placed on each machine after the close of the polls were broken, and the machines were activated. The board chairman cast eleven votes for Mooradian on machine 0563. When the machine was reopened, the total remained at twenty-nine. The chairman then proceeded to test machine 1152 by casting eleven votes for Mooradian. When the machine was reopened, Mooradian was discovered actually to have suffered a loss of seven votes; her total read thirty-two. A representative of the manufacturer told the board that the machines in question were of 1936-37 vintage and that the malfunction could have been caused by a variety of mechanical ailments brought on by old age. The manufacturer’s representative mentioned springs that no longer sprang and rusty gears that no longer meshed. He also told the board that even though an <em>X </em>would appear on the face of the ballot beside the candidate’s name, the vote was not being recorded by the counting mechanism.</p>

In its order for the special election, the board made clear that it was attempting to reconstruct the voting process as it existed on November 4, 1980. Accordingly, it ruled that the special election would be limited to the polling places at the Special Services Center and the Mat-teoti Club. Those eligible to vote at the special election were those voters who had in fact voted at either polling place on Election Day. The ballot that would appear on the voting machines ■ was to be identical to the one used in the November election. The master lever and all candidates’ levers were to be operational. Mail voting might be employed by those voters who had voted at the polls in November but who, for some reason, could not come to the polls at the time specified for the January 1981 election. The only votes that were to be counted and tabulated were the votes cast in the special election for the candidates who ran for the at-large council seats.</p>

This statutory provision sets out the procedure to be followed when one seeks a second count of the votes cast in an election or a reconsideration of the voting-machine tally. In essence § 17-19-36 provides that on the day following the election, the board of canvassers in each of the municipalities shall announce the machine results but will delay the issuance of a certificate of election for a period of seven days following the election. During this period, any “candidate” may ask the board to open the machines upon which his or her name appeared and to check the totals of the votes cast for the office that he or she sought. Buonanno submits that the proceedings before the board were not initiated by the “candidate” and also contends that the recount petition was not timely filed.</p>

As a general rule, an agency may be created for the performance of any lawful act, including acts done under the authorization of a statute. In order to determine that the right conferred by statute shall only be exercised personally and cannot be delegated to an agent, something must be found in the act by express enactment or necessary implication that prevents the agent from acting. <em>Smith v.

    <p id="b817-4" data-blocks='[["BL_817.4",817,[177,1183,753,1282]]]'>The board found that Jeremiah was acting as Mooradian’s agent when, on November 5, 1980, he sought the recount and the examination of the machines. We see no reason to fault such a finding. We think it significant that when Jeremiah filed the recount petition, he was wearing two hats: he was chairman of Cranston’s Republican Party, and he was an attorney. Mooradian could reasonably believe that Jeremiah was more knowledgeable concerning the state’s election laws than she was and, consequently, that he was to be entrusted with the task of actively contesting the election. Interestingly enough, the agency issue did not arise until after the recount had been completed and Jeremiah had asked that the machines be examined for possible malfunctions. When the board gathered in early December 1980 to test the machines, the agency challenge was raised, and an offer of proof was made on Mooradian’s behalf indicating that if the board wished, she would testify that Jeremiah’s initial request was duly authorized by her. The board’s chairman ruled that such an offer was not necessary, and we echo his sentiments.</p>

This is so whether or not it was Mooradian who origi-nally authorized him to seek the recount or whether or not it was she who later ratified the action. As the board noted, Mooradian was present throughout the recount and the examination of the machines, and at no time did she object to Jeremiah’s representation that he was acting as her agent. The acts of one claiming to be an agent can be ratified by inaction that manifests consent, and the results may rest wholly upon a finding of fact that a failure to take action indicated the consent necessary for ratification. <em>Osborn v.
