Avery Clark, created the trust under an irrevocable deed of gift dated October 30, 1942. The trust was created for the benefit of Kate’s son, Avery B. Clark, to pay him all of the net income, and so much of the principal as the trustees may deem advisable for his suitable maintenance or support, during his life. The trust further provided for certain distribution schemes to take effect upon Avery’s death, depending upon the survival of his heirs and the order in which they died. Kate’s husband and son, Joseph S. Clark, Sr., and Joseph S. Clark, Jr., were appointed to serve as trustees.</p>

Avery’s only child died in 1966 without issue. Avery’s widow, Patricia Hughes Clark, never remarried and died on June 12, 2000. Her death marked the termination of the 1942 Trust under Deed of Gift of Kate R. Avery Clark, and resulted in the instant Account and litigation between the surviving trustee, First Union National Bank, and appellants. Appellants argue that the principal of the trust should not be paid to Harvard University, but instead to Kate’s remaining heir, namely appellant Miller. They argue, in pertinent part, that the 1949 Recital is without legal force and effect as it was executed for tax reasons that no longer apply,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> its enforcement is contrary to Kate’s intent to keep the principal of the trust within her family, and that it was never “delivered” to Harvard. Moreover, appellants argue that the Recital was invalidated by language in Kate’s Will and Codicil “revoking and setting aside all wills, testaments, codicils, and other testamentary writings at any time heretofore made by me.”</p>
    <p id="b1237-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.11",1237,[963,867,756,1142]]]'>¶ 8 Each of appellants’ arguments is without merit. We first note that all parties agree that the current factual scenario of survivorship was not enumerated in the distribution provisions of the original trust. Those terms did not account for the possibility that Avery’s only child would die, without issue, before his widow, thereby leaving no one to receive the benefits of the trust. The 1942 Deed of Gift does not include any provision for the distribution of the Trust in the event of the deaths of Patricia and Avery’s daughter, when they both survived Avery. Indeed, the fact that the trust’s terms did not account for every potential scenario in its terms resulted in the possibility — remote as it was — that there was a reversionary interest retained by Kate. For tax reasons, this remote possibility of a reversionary interest was undesirable, and the Recital was therefore executed to eliminate it.</p>
    <p id="b1237-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.12",1237,[964,2059,756,462]]]'>¶ 9 Thus, the Recital did not improperly amend the irrevocable trust, but sought merely to deal with a reversionary interest its drafters had apparently not envisioned, or at least did not spell out in the original deed, in 1942. The fact that the tax purpose for the Recital “evaporated” shortly after <em>Spiegel </em>created it is irrelevant with respect to the Recital’s validity.</p>

      <a id="p1204" href="#p1204" data-label="1204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1204</a>¶ 10 In addition, had Kate intended to keep the reversionary interest in the trust property within the family, as appellants argue, she could have executed a Recital that did so. But instead, she named Harvard University as the remainderman. <em>See In re Baker’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/495/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="495 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1770739" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0522-01">495 Pa. 522</a>, 525, <a href="/pa/495/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="495 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1770739" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0522-01">434 A.2d 1213</a>, 1214 (1981) (holding that the meaning of words used is determinative, not what court thinks testator might or would have said, or even what court thinks testator meant to say); <em>In re Wainwright’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/376/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="376 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1246185" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0161-01">376 Pa. 161</a>, 164, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20724" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="101 A.2d 724">101 A.2d 724</a>, 725 (1954) (holding that however great the temptation to supply terms in accordance with what testatrix presumably would have provided had the omission been called to her attention, a court is without power to reform an unambiguous instrument) (citing <em>In re Verner’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/358/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="358 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="8845475" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0280-01">358 Pa. 280</a>, 282, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20667" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="56 A.2d 667">56 A.2d 667</a>, 668 (1948)).</p>
    <p id="b1238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1238.4",1238,[182,1412,760,1289]]]'>¶ 11 Moreover, we are unpersuaded that the Recital’s terms fail because the rever-sionary interest described therein was not “delivered” to Harvard. Unlike the cases cited by appellants for this proposition, the interest described by the Recital was not a gift of present interest but rather one of future inchoate, possible interest, and therefore the requirement of delivery referred to in those cases is not applicable. <em>See, e.g., Kreisl v. Kreisl, </em><a href="/pa/415/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="415 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1891819" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0424-01">415 Pa. 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=204%20A.2d%2040" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="204 A.2d 40">204 A.2d 40</a> (1964) (presently-owned partnership interest not delivered to alleged do-nee); <em>Estate of Evans, </em><a href="/pa/467/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="467 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1717343" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0336-01">467 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="467 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1717343" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0336-01">356 A.2d 778</a> (1976) (contents of safe deposit box not delivered to alleged donee). “A trust can be created without notice to or acceptance by the beneficiary.” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 36. In this case, Kate could do nothing more to complete her potential gift to Harvard, except wait for the order of death to be established, and thus the gift described in the Recital was complete and she could not revoke it. <em>Cf. Evans, supra.</em>

    <p id="b1238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1238.5",1238,[991,287,751,606]]]'>¶ 12 Finally, the 1949 and 1950 Will and Codicil do not invalidate the Recital, because the Recital — which related to the trust under deed of gift — was not a will, testament, codicil or other testamentary writing, and only such documents were expressly revoked and set aside by the new Will. Therefore, the unambiguous terms of the Recital are enforceable and the trial court properly decided that Harvard University is entitled to distribution of the trust.</p>
