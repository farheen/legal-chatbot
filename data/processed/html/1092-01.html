Horn, former Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (Department). This case had its genesis in December of 1997, when inmate Purcell Bronson filed a lawsuit addressed to this Court’s original jurisdiction, in which he challenged Administrative Directive No. 7.13.1-2. Issued by Horn, the Administrative Directive limited to $10.00 a month the amount that the Department would place in an inmate account for legal mailings. Previously, this amount was $40.00 per month. Bronson averred that the directive makes no allowances for court-imposed deadlines and that it was issued with “the express intention of obstructing, interfering with, and denying him access to the courts.” (Petition for Review, ¶ 7.) He further averred that it was aimed at, and singled out, “fjjailhouse [l]awyer[s].” <em>(Id., </em>¶ 8.) He claimed, generally, that, as a result of this directive, he has been denied access to the United States Supreme Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the Pennsylvania Superior Court. Further, he maintained that, due to the directive, he suffered “delayed access to the courts” and adverse decisions because he had been unable to respond to court orders and deadlines. <em>(Id., </em>¶ 10.) Additionally, he asserted that he has been penalized by prison officials for receiving legal assistance when other inmates have mailed documents out for <a id="p1094" href="#p1094" data-label="1094" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1094</a>him. Finally, he stated that the directive also precludes debiting an account for copying fees for items that cannot be hand-copied. As relief, he sought a declaratory judgment that the policy, as applied and on its face, is unlawful because it deprives him of access to the courts, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution under <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>.

In addition, courts should consider three other factors: the existence of “alternative means of exercising the right” available to inmates; “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally;” and “the absence of ready alternatives” available to the prison for achieving the governmental objectives.</blockquote>

The Department’s stated reason for the administrative directive is that it allows it to continue to provide inmates with access to the courts, while taking into consideration: (1) the need for consistent application of the policy and practices throughout the state’s correctional institutions; and (2) the Department’s fiscal responsibility to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (Respondents’ Response to Petitioners First Set of Interrogatories, Question 1.) This statement is nowhere rebutted by Bronson in any affidavit or other evidentiary submission. We hold that this evidence establishes a rational connection between the regulation and a legitimate neutral governmental interest. It does so because it permits court access, limits the funds advanced equally for each indigent inmate, and holds a line on taxpayer monies employed for this purpose.</p>

We note, initially, that the Department cannot, constitutionally, totally prohibit legal filings. Nonetheless, an inmate does not have the right to unlimited free <a id="p1096" href="#p1096" data-label="1096" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1096</a>postage, <em>Twyman v.

Thus, in our view, the option to place a <em>neutral </em>restriction, such as a dollar limitation, on the costs to be advanced by the Department for those filings is a permissible one. In fact, such a system allows the <em>inmate, </em>not the Department, to choose which cases to bring and which to forgo. Therefore, the policy does not arbitrarily act to prevent the filing of claims pertaining to the challenge of the underlying criminal sentence or the conditions of confinement. The alternative for indigent inmates who wish to exercise their constitutional right to access the courts is to prioritize their legal filings. This is no more than is expected of all litigants, incarcerated or not, who must consider the fiscal implications of various litigation costs and strategies. For example, when an indigent inmate has insufficient funds, the inmate can shift costs to the following month when he or she will have more funds by requesting, for that reason, an extension of time for filing documents. The inmate can also reduce costs by seeking leave to file fewer copies of documents, and in extreme cases a court could, where warranted, order the Department to permit additional photocopying or mailing. Although Bronson seems to be arguing that the $10 limit is insufficient per se, he has not presented any evidence to support that position and, in fact, a $7.70 per month limitation has been upheld by the Eighth Circuit. <em>See Blaise v. Fenn, </em><a href="/f3d/48/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="48 F.3d 337" data-case-ids="7408903" data-case-paths="/f3d/48/0337-01">48 F.3d 337</a> (8th Cir.1995) (limitation upheld because there was an available institutional procedure for requesting an increase).</p>

Bronson suggests, and is no doubt correct, that the effect of this policy will be to curtail the activities of certain “jailhouse lawyers.” However, the Supreme Court held in <em>Shaw </em>that there is no constitutional right to a jailhouse lawyer. Thus, even if Bronson’s allegation is true, it does not mean that the policy must be stricken. Moreover, the Department persuasively argues that because the money being advanced for inmate legal mailings is coming from its own budget,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> it must, as a result, curtail the amounts available for other important programs, such as drug rehabilitation and educational opportunities.</p>

Bronson sets forth no alternatives, other than implying that he should have unlimited funds. Given the goals of rehabilitation, which can certainly include fiscal self-management, and the need to allocate taxpayer monies for other Departmental programs, we are not aware of a better remedy than a neutral monthly cap. Accordingly, we conclude that the policy passes constitutional muster.</p>

Bronson has not offered any evidence in support of his discrimination theory. Moreover, prison administrators have a legitimate reason to restrict idle pay, <em>ie., </em>to encourage inmate compliance with rules. The record reveals that Bronson has a history of violent behavior, perhaps the most relevant example for our purposes being that he killed another inmate <em>while in prison. </em>(Deposition of Bronson, dated Sept. 1, 2000, pp. 15-17.) Given these facts, and the absence of any mitigating ones, we conclude that Bronson has not put forth any evidence indicating entitlement to idle pay or any discrimination on the part of institutional officers in refusing to award it.</p>

The Department argues that we should dismiss this case as moot because (1) Horn is no longer the Commissioner of Corrections and (2) Bronson is now in a different state prison. We decline to dismiss because the policy remains and is being enforced, albeit under the authority of a different Commissioner (now Secretary) of Corrections, and because the rules provide for automatic substitution when a government official leaves office. <em>See </em>Pa. R.A.P. 503(c). Further, the policy has statewide application; therefore, which state institution Bronson is currently being housed is irrelevant.</p>
