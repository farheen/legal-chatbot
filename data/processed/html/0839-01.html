    <p id="b872-13" data-blocks='[["BL_872.14",872,[991,1002,749,185]]]'>The determinative question, as we see it, is whether Wharton, as a member of the Board, was a State “employee” within the scope and meaning of the Pension Act.</p>

The pertinent Statute, in effect at the time of Wharton’s death, was 37 Del.Laws, Chap. 241:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> There were three members of the Industrial Accident Board, each entitled to receive an annual salary of $3,600. payable “monthly in the same manner as the salaries of State officers are paid.” Each was appointed by the Governor for a term of six years, by and with the consent of the Senate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Board was authorized to elect one of its members as Chairman, to “employ such clerical and other assistants as it deems necessary”, and to fix their compensation. It was authorized to have an official State seal. It was directed to <a id="p841" href="#p841" data-label="841" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*841</a>“maintain and keep open during reasonable hours, an office adequate for the transaction of its business”; and to “keep a record of all its proceedings and such other books and records as shall be required for the proper and efficient administration” of the Workmen’s Compensation Law. The Board was given jurisdiction over all workmen’s compensation cases, with power to hear disputes as to compensation, to make its own rules of procedure, and to compel the attendance of witnesses. It was charged with the responsibility of inquiring into the causes and results of industrial accidents; of studying the most advanced methods of safeguarding against such accidents; of inquiring into the subject of fair compensation for workmen and their families; of studying the operation and effect of the Delaware Workmen’s Compensation Law; and of reporting annually relative thereto to the General Assembly. The Statute required that all money or income received by the Board from “taxes, fees and/or operations” be deposited daily with the State Treasurer, to the credit of the General Fund of the State. By 19 Del.C. § 2107(b), the following provision was made:</p>
    <blockquote id="b873-5" data-blocks='[["BL_873.6",873,[263,1654,711,372]]]'>“(b) All disbursements made by the Board for salaries, expenses or other authorized expenditures, shall be paid by the State Treasurer, out of funds appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose, on vouchers signed by two members of the Board and approved by the State Auditor of Accounts.”</blockquote>

He was repeatedly referred to in the Statute as being an employee of, or employed by, a State “department or agency”:</p>
    <p id="b873-7" data-blocks='[["BL_873.8",873,[227,2463,749,278]]]'>For example, under certain circumstances specified in Section 2, the employee might “continue active work at the option of the head of the department or agency by which he or she is employed.” And by Section 5 it was provided:</p>

The payment of the monthly pension benefits of this Act shall be made in the same way and by the same proceedings as salaries are paid and so provided for the active employees, except only as herein otherwise provided.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b873-10" data-blocks='[["BL_873.11",873,[1025,1220,575,37]]]'>And by Section 6 it was provided:</p>

In either event, the head of the department or agency shall prepare a statement in such form as may be prescribed by the State Treasurer to enable him to comply with this Section; the head of the department or agency shall, at least fifteen days prior to the date of retirement, give a certified copy of such statement to the State Treasurer, who shall finally decide whether the employee is entitled to the pension benefits and the amount thereof, except only in the case of a controversy, provision for which is in this Act provided. * *</blockquote>

Such legislative intent becomes apparent from the details of the structure created for the operation of the Act. As a member of the Industrial Accident Board, Wharton did not fall within that category. He was not an employee of, or employed by, his agency; rather, he and his colleagues were employees of the State who constituted the agency. It is not reasonable to classify Wharton’s position as a Board member along with employees who may choose to “continue active work”, at the option of the head of his department, rather than retire; who receive “leaves of absence” for illness and travel; who under given circumstances are “kept on the active salary payroll” rather than declared disabled; who may be involuntarily retired by the head of his department or agency upon 30 days’ written notice. Such indicia of applicability become wholly incongruous when attempt is made to apply them to one in Wharton’s position as a member of the Industrial Accident Board. Obviously, as a Board member, Wharton’s position may not be fitted into the pattern of the procedures and proceedings by which, in our opinion, the General Assembly limited the applicability of the Pension Act to those who were employees of, or employed by, State departments or agencies.</p>
    <p id="b874-9" data-blocks='[["BL_874.12",874,[973,497,749,562]]]'>Placing main reliance upon the provisions of Section 3 above quoted, the plaintiff seeks to rest upon the showing that Wharton “received a regular salary or wage * * * directly from the State Treasurer”; that, therefore, he was within “covered employment.” That fact alone does not define an eligible employee under the Act. The status of “employee” must be established first before the requisite of “covered employment” is reached. The plaintiff’s case fails to meet that first test.</p>
