Newberger, a constable in Hillsborough County, certain fees for services rendered as such constable. The fees claimed were in like amounts as are provided by law to be paid to the sheriff of that county for like services. Alternative writ of mandamus issued. A demurrer was filed to the writ and upon final hearing peremptory writ was issued.</p>

The subsequent amendment or repeal of the adopted statute has no effect on the adopting statute unless it is also repealed expressly or by necessary implication. But when the adopting statute makes no reference to any particular statute or part óf statute by its title or otherwise, but refers to the law generally which governs a particular subject, the reference in such a case includes not only the law in force at the date of the adopting act, but also all subsequent laws on the particular subject referred to, so far at least as they are consistent with the purpose of the adopting act. When a prior act is incorporated in a subsequent one in terms or by relation, the repeal of the former leaves the latter in force, unless also repealed expressly or by necessary implication. ’ ’</blockquote>
