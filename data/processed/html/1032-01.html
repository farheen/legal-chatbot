On January 6, 1982, he was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to twenty years probation. No direct appeal followed. On June 28, 1986, appellant was released from state prison where he had been incarcerated on unrelated crimes, and appellant requested the State Board of Probation and Parole to permit him to move to California. On July 22, 1987, appellant pleaded guilty to attempted burglary in California. He served sixty days in a California prison, and, upon his release, he was ordered to return to Pennsylvania and contact the probation and parole authorities. He did return to Pennsylvania but failed to contact his parole officer. On October 23, 1987, appellant was arrested on drug-related charges, and he pleaded guilty to those charges on April 14, 1988.</p>

Appellant’s twenty year sentence of probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to two and one-half to twenty years of incarceration for his 1981 burglary conviction. His motion to modify sentence was denied, and an appeal followed. Therein, appellant alleged that he was prejudiced because his probation violation was not presented to the sentencing court within a reasonable time and that his probation revocation counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay evidence of prior convictions and for failing to request a continuance for better preparation. We affirmed appellant’s judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v. McGriff, </em><a href="/citations/?q=392%20Pa.%20Super.%20651" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="392 Pa.

He also complained that he did not receive adequate notice of his probation revocation hearing and was not given notice of the grounds for the revocation. The public defender’s office was appointed to represent appellant. An amended PCRA petition was filed which alleged that appellant’s guilty plea was invalid because of the absence of an on-the-record guilty plea colloquy, that appellant’s pleas were involuntary, that prior counsel was ineffective for failing to insure an on-the-record colloquy was performed and for failing to move to withdraw appellant’s plea. Since the <a id="p1035" href="#p1035" data-label="1035" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1035</a>public defender’s office originally represented appellant, new counsel was appointed to permit the ineffectiveness allegation to proceed.

This argument fails for two reasons. First, appellant’s original sentence was not illegal, and, therefore, he is not entitled to post conviction relief, 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 9543(a)(2)(vii). Although the court did not specifically state that the sentence of probation was for the burglary which it should have done, <em>Commonwealth v.

See, N.T., 1/6/82, pp. 7-8.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Second, appellant was resentenced on June 3, 1988, because of numerous probation violations, and he does not allege that his current sentence is illegal. Thus, his attack on his initial sentence of probation is moot. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa-super/336/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa.

This issue has been finally litigated and/or waived by appellant, and, thus, he is not entitled to relief. 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9543(a)(3)(i), 9544(a)(1), 9544(b). In his motion to modify his sentence, appellant specifically alleged that his due process rights were violated by the Commonwealth’s failure to provide him notice of the probation revocation hearing and the acts which would serve as the basis of his revocation. However, appellant neglected to continue these issues in his direct appeal, and, thus, the issue is waived. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em> </em>Moreover, appellant finally litigated similar issues in his direct appeal from his probation revocation. 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9543(a)(3), 9544(a)(2). Therein, he complained that <em>his revocation hearing was not held soon enough, </em>that his counsel was ineffective for failing to insure that hearsay evidence of the crimes which served as the basis for the revocation was not admitted and that counsel was ineffective for failing to request a continuance for further preparation. On direct appeal, we found no merit to these issues. <em>McGriff, supra.</em>

We find that appellant has waived his right to challenge his guilty plea. Appellant did not file a motion to withdraw his plea, and he did not file a direct appeal challenging his plea. <a id="p1036" href="#p1036" data-label="1036" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1036</a>Further, he did not challenge the voluntariness of his plea following his probation revocation and resentencing.

First, appellant has been presented with previous opportunities to raise trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness for failing to perfect a direct appeal and has neglected so to do. Thus, the issue is waived. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9544(b). Second, appellant does not allege which issues counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on direct appeal, with the exception of counsel’s failure to attack appellant’s plea on direct appeal. Boldface allegations of ineffectiveness will not preserve issues for appeal. <em>Gibson, </em><a href="/pa-super/385/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="385 Pa.

Although appellant alleges that his plea colloquy occurred off-the-record, it is clear that the colloquy was held on-the-record in open court. However, it is also clear that the transcription of the guilty plea colloquy was lost sometime during the nine years between entry of his plea on December 7, 1981, and the filing of appellant’s pro se PCRA petition on January 17, 1991. To the extent that appellant contends his plea was not entered in a knowing and voluntary manner, this contention must fail because appellant has neglected to comply with Pa.R.A.P. 1923 which sets forth the procedure for completing the record when a transcript is missing. Moreover, we agree with the Commonwealth and the PCRA court that appellant’s unexplained delay in filing his PCRA challenge to his guilty plea has prejudiced the Commonwealth’s ability to respond to his allegations concerning his plea. Accordingly, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(b), we dismiss this allegation of error because of the inordinate, unexplained delay. <em>Cf., Commonwealth v.

In regard to his allegation that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge his plea on direct appeal, we note that appellant has not alleged that he is innocent.
