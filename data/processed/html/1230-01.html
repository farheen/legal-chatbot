Cynthia Murray (Murray) was driving northbound with Lisa Peltier (Peltier) in the passenger seat. According to the trial justice’s findings, Murray’s car apparently “left its lane of travel, crossed either a dividing line and/or median strip, and made contact with the defendant’s * * * truck * * * in the defendant’s lane.” As a result of the accident, Peltier, then sixteen, died, and Murray, then eighteen, was seriously injured.

On April 2, 1993, the trial justice dismissed both counts. Although it is not altogether clear from the record, the trial justice appeared to reason that there was no evidence tending to show that defendant’s intoxication and his manner of operating his vehicle caused the collision. The state argued that if defendant’s blood-alcohol content was over the statutorily prescribed limit and serious bodily injury or death resulted, then the manner of defendant’s driving would be irrelevant. The trial justice pointed out absurdities that would result from this interpretation and as such dismissed the case for lack of probable cause. This appeal followed pursuant to G.L.1956 (1985 Reenactment) § 9-24-32. The sole issue now before us is whether §§ 31-27-2.2(a) and 31-27-2.6(a) require proximate cause between a defendant’s manner of operating his or her motor vehicle and the resulting death or serious bodily injury.</p>

With <em>Dionne </em>and its progeny as guidance, we now hold that § 31-27-2.2(a) contains a similar and very basic proximate cause requirement as does § 31-27-l(a). We note the General Assembly is presumed to “know the state of existing relevant law when it enacts a statute.” <em>State v.

The only distinction between the two sections, in this vein, is that under § 31-27-1 (a) the General Assembly has required the additional causal element that the defendant’s operation be reckless. Under § 31-27-2.2(a) there is no additional-causal element, but only the requirement that the collision occur while the defendant was legally intoxicated. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra.</em>

As the trial justice noted below, if a person were driving while legally intoxicated and an airplane suddenly plunged from the sky into the driver’s motor vehicle, killing the pilot, the driver would be criminally culpable, according to the state’s interpretation. It is well settled that this court will not attribute to the Legislature an intent that leads to an absurd or unreasonable result. <em>State v.

We note that this evidence need not necessarily show that the defendant’s manner of operating his or her motor vehicle was either reckless or criminally negligent, as there is nothing in the statute to require this.

We believe the plain and literal language of § 31-27-2.6 is dispositive. <em>Caithness RICA Ltd. Partnership v. Malachowski, </em><a href="/a2d/619/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="619 A.2d 833" data-case-ids="7360203" data-case-paths="/a2d/619/0833-01">619 A.2d 833</a>, 836 (R.I.1993). The first clause of § 31-27-2.6(a) provides, “When serious bodily injury of any person other than the operator is <em>caused by the operation of any motor vehicle.” </em>(Emphasis added.) As we have noted often, this court must give “effect to all of a statute’s provisions, with no sentence, clause, or word construed as unmeaning or surplusage.” <em>Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals v. R.B., </em><a href="/a2d/549/1028-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="549 A.2d 1028" data-case-ids="7883309" data-case-paths="/a2d/549/1028-01">549 A.2d 1028</a>, 1030 (R.I.1988). Therefore, we hold that the phrase “caused by the operation of any motor vehicle” in § 31-27-2.6(a) requires the state to prove that the defendant’s manner of operating his or her motor vehicle was a proximate cause of the injury in question. Like § 31-27-2.2(a), § 31-27-2.6(a) does not require the state to prove that the defendant’s conduct rose to the level of criminal negligence or recklessness. Additionally, as we stated in regard to § 31-27-2.2(a), § 31-27-2.6(a) does not require the defendant’s intoxication as a causal element of the offense but merely requires that the defendant be legally intoxicated at the time of the accident.</p>

The plain language of the two statutes at issue requires the state to prove only three elements: (1) the death or serious bodily injury of a person other than the defendant-operator occurred, (2) the death or serious bodily injury was the proximate result of the operation of a vehicle, and (3) the defendant-operator was under the influence of alcohol or drags. Nothing in these statutes requires the state to prove deficiency in the defendant-operator’s operation of the vehicle.</p>

In fact, the majority opinion, <em>supra, </em>has explicitly reached this same conclusion: “[T]he statutes before us do not require a search for * * * legislative intent. The language is unambiguous.” <em>Supra. </em>Both enactments before us are clearly strict-liability statutes. Neither requires a causal connection between a defendant’s manner of operating a motor vehicle and the resulting death or serious bodily injury, but rather both require only that the death or serious bodily injury be caused by the operation of any vehicle, the operator of which is under the influence of any intoxicating liquor.</p>
    <p id="b1293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1293.4",1293,[180,1154,754,898]]]'>In its interpretation of these statutes, the majority does not require a causal connection between defendant’s <em>intoxication </em>and the death or serious bodily injury but does require a causal connection between defendant’s <em>manner </em>of operating a vehicle and the resulting death or injury. In other words, the majority requires the state to produce some evidence that defendant’s manner of operation of the vehicle was deficient, though the level of deficiency need not amount to recklessness or criminal negligence. By reading into these statutes a requirement that the death or serious bodily injury be caused by the “manner” of the operation of a motor vehicle, the majority has impermissi-bly rewritten the statutes and in consequence has circumvented and avoided their plain and literal meanings.</p>
    <p id="b1293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1293.5",1293,[181,2074,755,563]]]'>General Laws 1956 (1982 Reenactment) § 31-27-2, as amended by P.L.1990, ch. 496, § 1, makes the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs a misdemeanor in this state. Persons who drive while intoxicated are therefore held accountable, regardless of whether a death or an injury occurred or did not occur. The harsh consequences of §§ 31-27-2.2 and -2.6 establish a public policy that holds persons strictly accountable for the criminal act of driving while intoxicated.</p>

The absence of language requiring a causal connection between a defendant’s manner of operating a vehicle and the resulting death or injury manifests an explicit attempt by the Legislature to create a more effective deterrent to drunk driving than a criminal statute requiring causation. The statutes establish a compelling deterrent to an individual who is about to engage in the criminal behavior of driving while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor precisely because of the statutes’ harsh and unforgiving application. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave and Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law </em>248 (2d ed. 1986) (discussing deterrent effects of strict-liability laws); <em>see also </em>Janet S.

The statutes in question are consistent with this viewpoint.</p>
