But the lower court had instructed the jury that the patent was for a new <em>method </em>of converting puddle balls to blooms “by continuous pressure and rotation * * * between converging surfaces.” The Supreme Court held the claim limited to the machine, since, in the Court’s mind, a contrary decision would call into question the validity of the claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In an influential aside on the way to this conclusion, Justice Grier, for a unanimous Court, discussed the patentability of processes:</p>

It is included under tbe general term “useful art.” Any art rday require one or more, processes or machines in order to produce a certain result' or manufacture. Tbe term machine includes every mechanical device or combination of mechanical powers and devices to perform some function and produce a certain effect or result. But where the result or effect is produced by chemical action, by the operation or application of some element of power of nature, or' of one substane to another, such modes, methods, or operations, are called processes. A new process is usually the result of a discovery; a machine,'of invention. The arts of tanning, dyeing, making water-proof cloth, vulcanizing, India- rubber, smelting ores, and numerous others are usually carried on- by processes, as distinguished from machines. One may discover a new and useful improvement in the process of tanning, dyeing, &amp;c., irrespective of any particular form of machinery or mechanical device. And another may invent a labor-saving machine by which this operation or process may be performed, and. each may be entitled to his patent. As, for instance, A has discovered that by exposing India rubber to a certain degree of heat, in mixture or connection with certain metallic salts, he can produce a valuable product or manufacture; he. is en’titled to a patent for his discovery, as a process or improvement in the art, irrespective of any machine or mechanical device. B, on the contrary, may invent a new furnace or stove, or steam apparatus, by which this process may be carried on with much saving of labor, and expense of fuel; and he will be - entitled to a patent for his machine, as an improvement in the art. Yet A could not have a patent for a machine, or B for a process; but each would have a patent for the means or method of producing a certain result, or effect, and not for the result or effect produced. It is for the discovery or invention of some practicable method or means of producing a beneficial result or effect, that a patent is granted, and not for the result or effect itself. It is when the term process is used to represent the means or method of producing a result that it is patentable, and it will include all methods or means which are not effected by mechanism or mechanical combinations.</blockquote>

Either may be pointed out; but if the patent is not confined to that particular tool or machine, the use of the others would be an infringement, the general process being the same. A process is a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing. If new and useful, it is just as patentable as is a piece of machinery. In the language of the patent law, it is an art. The machinery pointed out as suitable to perform the process may or may not be new or patentable; whilst the process itself may be altogether new, and produce an entirely new result. The process requires that certain things should be done with certain substances, and in a certain order; but the tools to be used in doing this may be of secondary consequence.

We see no interest of the Patent System well served by such a practice.</p>

Beginning with a decision in 1901 of the Court of Appeals for the District' of Columbia, the predecessor of this court in jurisdiction of appeals from the Patent Office, the rule that a process which amounts to no more than the mere function of a machine is not patentable has been consistently followed over a period of nearly seventy years. So far as I know, the rule has been generally acquiesced in and accepted, and has been applied in a score or more of cases in this court without challenge.</p>

I have no fault to find with the scholarly and scrupulously fair review and analysis of the development of the rule, which appeats in the majority opinion. It may well be that “the decisions of the Supreme Court have not required the rejection of process claims merely because the process apparently could be carried out only with the disclosed apparatus.” But note also that no decision of the Supreme Court has disapproved of the rejection of process claims for that reason. I do not dispute that “the doctrine has been shown not to proceed from its purported well-springs,” and it may have been the product of an essentially illogical distinction. However, I cannot agree that it is at odds with the basic purposes of the patent system or that “it is productive of a range of undesirable results from the highly inequitable to the silly” or that the rule denies to certain inventors the <a id="p1458" href="#p1458" data-label="1458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1458</a>exclusive rights to their discoveries or that, in some cases, “the inventor may be cheated of his invention.”</p>

Since <em>Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co., </em><a href="/us/383/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="383 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6166987" data-case-paths="/us/383/0001-01">383 U.S. 1</a>, it has been generally accepted that the Act of 1952 was in effect a codification of statutory law and judicial precedents and not intended to change the “general level of patentable inventions.” Thus, the principle that a process which is merely the function of an apparatus is unpatentable, which by that time had become settled law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> was, by implication, adopted by Congress.</p>
    <p id="b798-5" data-blocks='[["BL_798.6",798,[216,1535,1323,562]]]'>As a matter of fact, it is highly questionable whether the rule curtails the rights of inventors to any substantial extent. Certainly it cannot be said that it perpetuates error from which grievous wrong results, or that there is any grave necessity for its repeal. And it may be pointed out that while the present rule limits the patentee’s rights in one respect, the law as adopted by the majority puts him in a position to exclude from any commercial exploitation every new and unobvious apparatus which may use the patented process to obtain an improved result in a more efficient manner — a consequence which, it would seem, could tend to discourage, rather than promote, the progress of science and useful arts. As the Government points out:</p>

However, equity is satisfied if appellant can obtain claims which adequately protect his invention. Appellant has been allowed such claims on his apparatus. The apparatus claims provide concrete protection for appellant’s invention. In the present state of the art the <a id="p1459" href="#p1459" data-label="1459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1459</a>specific method which appellant claims can only be performed by the apparatus claimed by appellant. The only purpose <em>served </em>by granting appellant the specific method claims would be to discourage others from inventing a different apparatus to perform the specific method. Such discouragement is not in accord with the policy of the Patent system. <em>In re Flint, </em><a href="/ccpa/51-2/1230-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="51 C.C.P.A. 1230" data-case-ids="6092307" data-case-paths="/ccpa/51-2/1230-01">51 CCPA 1230</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20299" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="144 U.S.P.Q.

It is not the object of the policy behind the patent system to encourage satisfaction with or commercialization only of the first device for performing a given function that happens to come along. And for those who may be interested in promoting <em>competition </em>in the interest of the consuming public, the greater the number of <em>functionally </em>equivalent devices which are encouraged onto the market by patent protection, the better off the consumer will be.</blockquote>

It serves to point up, however, that the “equities” are not weighted so heavily on one side as the majority assumes. If the Government’s theory is correct, the majority’s newly-charted course is contrary to the basic constitutional objective of promoting the progress of the useful arts; if that espoused by the majority is correct, the many prior decisions of this court have seemingly been causing progress in the useful arts to languish, which does not appear to have been the fact to any noticeable extent.</p>

It does not seem to me that the facts here justify the wholesale reversal of the settled law of this court on the abstract proposition of “equity.” Rather, it should be asked “equity” for whom? The inventor here? Other inventors in this and related fields? The public?</p>
