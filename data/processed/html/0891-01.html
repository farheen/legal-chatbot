As Evans walked from the courtroom, two police officers sitting in the gallery overheard him speak to an unidentified person behind them. The officers heard Evans say that he was going to kill the witness, another police officer, who had just testified against him. The officers reported what they heard, and Evans was charged with the misdemeanor of making a threat to do bodily harm in violation of D.C.Code § 22-507 (1996). Prior to trial, the government reduced the charge against Evans to one of attempted threats in violation of D.C.Code §§ 22-103 and 22-507. The trial court found Evans guilty of that offense in a bench trial.</p>

In other words, Evans argues that the evidence in any prosecution for attempted threats will establish either the consummated offense of threats or no offense at all. Evans further asserts that the government improperly charged him with an attempt solely in order to deprive him of a right to a jury trial.</p>

In its current codification, the statute provides in pertinent part that “[wjhoever shall attempt to commit any crime, which attempt is not otherwise made punishable by chapter 19 of [the 1901 Act], shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or both.” D.C.Code § 22-103.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We think it immaterial that threats was not a crime when the general attempts statute became law in 1901. The attempts statute refers expansively to attempts to commit “any crime,” and we can find no warrant for construing that language narrowly so as to exclude new crimes created after 1901 from its scope. On the contrary, without even commenting on the matter, we have long understood the attempts statute to apply to subsequently created offenses. <em>See Greenwood v.

To prove an attempt, the government is not required to prove more than “an overt act done with the intent to commit a crime, ... which, except for some interference, would have resulted in the commission of the crime.” <em>Wormsley v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/526/1373-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="526 A.2d 1373" data-case-ids="7927919" data-case-paths="/a2d/526/1373-01">526 A.2d 1373</a>, 1375 (D.C.1987).

This court has previously rejected Evans’s claim that “merely uttering a threat completes the crime.” <em>United States v. Baish, </em><a href="/a2d/460/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="460 A.2d 38" data-case-ids="7945816" data-case-paths="/a2d/460/0038-01">460 A.2d 38</a>, 42 n. 5 (D.C.1983). “The essential elements of the offense of threats to do bodily harm are: that the defendant uttered words to another person; that the words were of such a nature as to convey fear of serious bodily harm or injury to the ordinary hearer; that the defendant intended to utter the words which constituted the threat.” <em>Campbell v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/450/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="450 A.2d 428" data-case-ids="7975914" data-case-paths="/a2d/450/0428-01">450 A.2d 428</a>, 431 n. 5 (D.C.1982). Thus, “an individual must do more than utter a threat; the evidence must show that the threatening message was conveyed to someone — either to the object of the threat or to a third party.” <em>Baish, </em><a href="/a2d/460/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="460 A.2d 38" data-case-ids="7945816" data-case-paths="/a2d/460/0038-01">460 A.2d at 42</a>. “An uncommunicated threat, by definition, cannot threaten.” <em><a href="/a2d/460/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="460 A.2d 38" data-case-ids="7945816" data-case-paths="/a2d/460/0038-01">Id.</a> </em>It follows that if a threat fortuitously goes unheard, the person who utters it is guilty of an attempt, not the completed offense. Attempted but unconsummated oral threats are easy to conceive — as where, for instance, a threat is garbled and not understood, or is whispered too softly to be heard, or is spoken <a id="p895" href="#p895" data-label="895" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*895</a>into a telephone answering device that malfunctions and fails to record the utterance, or is recorded but erased before anyone listens to it. As a practical matter, such unconsummated threats may be unprovable, for lack of available evidence; but there is no doubt that they can be perpetrated. Evans was not, therefore, convicted of a non-existent crime.</p>
    <p id="b937-5" data-blocks='[["BL_937.4",937,[179,770,751,339]]]'>Since “attempted threats” is a valid statutory offense, the United States Attorney had discretion to charge it. “If the facts show a violation of two or more statutes, an election may be made to prosecute under either.” <em>United States v.

Under D.C.Code § 16 — 705(b) (2001), a defendant is entitled to a jury trial on all offenses (except contempt of court) that are punishable by imprisonment for <em>more than </em>180 days. The maximum prison sentence for attempted threats is <em>just </em>180 days. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-103. The maximum prison sentence for the completed offense of misdemeanor threats, on the other hand, is six months, which is deemed to be slightly more than 180 days. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-507; <em>Turner v. Bayly, </em><a href="/a2d/673/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="673 A.2d 596" data-case-ids="7862614" data-case-paths="/a2d/673/0596-01">673 A.2d 596</a>, 597 (D.C.1996). Thus, had Evans been prosecuted for threats instead of attempted threats, he would have enjoyed a right to be tried by a jury. But that does not mean that Evans’s rights were violated. The existence of a right to a jury trial depends on the maximum punishment for the offense that is charged, not on the maximum punishment for an offense that could be charged but is not. Ultimately, Evans was charged with attempted threats. Since the maximum punishment for that offense fell below the statutory threshold, Evans was not denied any statutory right to a jury trial, for he simply had no such right.</p>
