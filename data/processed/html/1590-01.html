This argument lacks substance as here there can be no resort to those sections. Where the inventorship is different and there is a common assignee, as here, the first filed application which issues as a patent is “by another” and if the invention claimed in the second application is “described” in the first application, it is available under section 102(e) as prior art which is relevant for consideration under section 103. If the second filed application issues first, there can be no resort to section 102(e) to establish it as prior art under section 103 as against the first filed application.  This results from the controlling effect which is given under the statute to the United States filing dates. Sections 102(e) and 103 provide grounds of rejection which are distinct and separate from “double patenting,” requiring different inquiries and representing mutually exclusive grounds for rejecting claims.
