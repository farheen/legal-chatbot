After the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Burke and against Schramm and awarded $600,000 in compensatory damages. The jury also found in favor of DOT and against Burke. Burke filed a motion for post-trial relief, which was denied by the trial court.

Officer Shaffer testified that he was dispatched to investigate the traffic accident and arrived at the scene within one minute of the call. He observed Schramm standing next to the car. During his interview with Schramm, he detected a strong odor of alcohol about her breath and about her person. He also testified: “Her eyes were watery, glassy, She needed support while she stood. And when she walked, she had a slight wobble to her gait.” (Notes of Testimony, January 13, 1998. p. 28.)

She testified that she had nothing to eat during that period. After leaving the restaurant/bar, Schramm went home where she ingested a 2 milligram Xanax tablet. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Schramm ate half a hoagie and then went to a night club where she remembered having one-half of a mixed drink. She also consumed a Slim Jim at the night club.

The evidence presented by DOT, the testimony of the investigating police officer and the deposition testimony of Schramm, is similar to the evidence found admissible in <em>Ackerman.</em>

Burke argues that because the corporate designee of Senopoulos Partners testified in a deposition <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>that he assumed that the pillar was his “responsibility,” a question of fact exists which must be resolved by a jury.</p>
    <p id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.4",292,[162,415,754,388]]]'>In his complaint, Burke alleged that Senopoulos Partners were negligent, <em>inter alia, </em>in allowing the pillar to exist on its property, in failing to remove the pillar, in allowing a dangerous condition to exist on its property, and in failing to cure a condition where it knew that the condition had caused similar accidents in the past.</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[159,829,756,736]]]'>The evidence presented at trial established that Senopoulos Partners purchased the property in June of 1993, approximately six weeks before Burke’s accident (R.R., p. 285) and that the pillars had been in place for at least twenty-five years prior to the accident (R.R., p. 97.) The evidence further established that it was not possible to determine just by looking at the pillar that it was within the right-of-way. (R.R., pp. 160 - 161.) Testimony at trial also established that Senopoulos Partners did not obtain a survey of the property at the time it acquired the property. (R.R., p. 286.)</p>
    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[158,1595,754,940]]]'>In addition, the evidence established that two accidents had occurred involving the pillar in the five years prior to Burke’s accident. (R.R., pp. 627, 629.) According to the police report for the February 11, 1988 accident, the driver was travelling at a high rate of speed and was under the influence of alcohol. (R.R., pp. 627 - 628.) The driver lost control of the vehicle, went off the right side of the road and struck the pillar. <em>(Id.) </em>According to the police report for the March 2, 1992 accident, the driver was changing the station of her radio and, when she looked up, she was at the curve in the road. (R.R., p. 629 - 630.) She applied her brakes and lost control of her vehicle. <em>(Id.) </em>The vehicle skidded off the roadway and struck the pillar. <em>(Id.)</em>
