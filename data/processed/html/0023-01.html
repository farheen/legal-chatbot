Suppression Hearing, 1/22/99, at 4-5. Officer Woodson testified at Appellant’s Suppression Hearing that while he was patrolling, an “unidentified passerby” told him that there was a group of six (6) to eight (8) males in the park area in the 1300 Block of Dauphin Street and that one of them was “brandishing a weapon.” <em>Id. </em>at 5. Officer Woodson recounted that the unidentified individual also told him that the man in the park with the weapon was “tall,” however the unidentified individual did not give any specific estimate of height. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Officer Woodson also stated that the nameless pedestrian did not provide any further descriptive identification of the man in the park with the weapon, such as the man’s race or the clothing which he was wearing. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 11. Officer Woodson additionally testified that the pedestrian who provided this information did not at any time identify himself, nor had Officer Woodson ever seen this individual before this occasion or at any time thereafter. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>

When Officer Woodson arrived at the park area he was joined by six other Temple University Police Officers, whom he had radioed to assist him. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 12. Upon arrival in the park area, Officer Woodson testified that he saw eight or nine people present in the park, including the Appellant. Officer Woodson observed no one holding any type of weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Officer Woodson testified that he “examined” the group of individuals and estimated the Appellant to be about six foot one (6’ 1”) to six foot two inches (6’ 2”) tall, however he observed that there were also a couple of individuals in the group who were “very .close” in height to Appellant as well. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>

The individuals complied with the officers’ request. While the males were standing on the sidewalk, Officer Woodson walked around and stood behind them. He asked if anyone had a weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Appellant replied that he did. Officer Woodson and the other officers then proceeded to frisk everyone in the group. The frisk yielded a black semiautomatic 9-millimeter handgun, which Appellant had tucked into his waistband.</p>

The second, an “investigative detention” must be supported by a reasonable suspicion; it subjects a suspect to a stop and a period of detention, but does not involve such coercive conditions as to constitute the functional equivalent of an arrest. <em>See Berkemer v.

As Justice Stevens has also cogently observed, were courts to sanction <em>Terry </em>stops solely on the basis of anonymous tips then “every citizen is subject to being seized and questioned by any officer who is prepared to testify that the warrantless stop was based on an anonymous tip predicting whatever conduct the officer just observed.” <em>Alabama v.

However, as the Supreme Court has made clear, the anonymous tip itself was not a basis for the officer to make an immediate <em>Terry </em>stop absent some independent corroboration by him of criminal activity. The officer was therefore not free to immediately detain every individual whom he saw on the belief that they might be the “tall” individual the unidentified pedestrian was referring to. Detaining and forcing an individual to be subjected to the indignity of an impromptu public police lineup requires more reasonable suspicion of that citizen’s involvement in criminal activity than vague uncorroborated allegations of an anonymous pedestrian.</p>
