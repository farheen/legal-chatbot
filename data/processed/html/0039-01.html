The [Appellant] avers that said transfer was the result of an oral property settlement agreement between the [Appellant] and the [Appel-lee], Pauline Chada, who were at that time separated and were contemplating divorce. The [Appellant] asserts that the transfer to Paul was in fact a transfer to Pauline, however, Paul was merely acting as her agent/nominee. The oral agreement, according to the [Appel<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>lant], is that, in return for this transfer of the Warsaw Township property and payment of a sum of $100,000.00, Pauline agreed to accept the same in full payment and satisfaction of all of her legal rights under the law for the distribution of marital property. After the transfer, the [Appellant] asserts that the [Appellee] Pauline rescinded the contract by filing a complaint in divorce in 1987, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, which included a claim for equitable distribution. A divorce decree, with provisions for equitable distribution, was issued on April 3, 1991. Subsequent thereto, the [Appellant] and the [Appellee] Pauline Chada were involved in the litigation of numerous petitions concerning the distribution of assets and the interpretation of the final decree. On August 5, 1996, a conference was held in Allegheny County before the Honorable Lawrence W. Kap-lan, wherein the [Appellant] and the [Appellee] Pauline Chada entered into a full and complete settlement agreement as to all issues related to the distribution of assets. The opening remarks of Judge Kaplan were as follows:</blockquote>

Moreover, Appellant, represented by able counsel, agreed on the record, that all claims relative to all economic issues arising out of the marriage, including claims as to real estate, were being disposed of. Thus, the claims Appellant now asserts have been litigated for purposes of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and therefore re-litigation of the ultimate issue of property ownership by means of the instant lawsuit, is likewise barred.</p>

We cannot and will not condone such efforts.</p>
