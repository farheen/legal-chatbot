P. Tooker, a contractor, for the construction of an apartment house thereon and the Drake Lumber Company, one of the appellants here, furnished said Tooker building material in the aggregate amount of $2,674.55 used in the beginning of said construction. The last material was delivered to Tooker on September 5, 1925, and on October 10, thereafter, he abandoned his construction contract. The said Anderson Properties, Inc., on October 15, 1925, executed an agreement with the Drake Lumber Company, acknowledging the above amount as due and agreed to pay for same. On October 16 and October 26, 1925, the said Drake Lumber Company furnished additional materials of the value of $195.00, upon the direct request and order of the owner, Anderson Properties, Inc. On October 10, 1925, the same date that said Tooker abandoned his contract, the title to said lot being perfected in Anderson Properties, Inc., it borrowed from H. C. Thompson $10,000.00, for which it gave a ninety-day note secured by a mortgage on said property, while said building was under construction; said mortgage being the one involved in this litigation. ■ On November 16, Anderson Properties, Inc., entered into a written contract with said Thurston Company in which the latter company agreed to furnish all labor, tools, equipment, transportation, material and everything necessary to complete the construction.</p>

It was also stipulated and agreed ‘.‘that if the lien of Drake Lumber Company is not barred by the statute limiting the time in which material lien foreclosures may be brought, it is still valid, effective and superior to the lien of the W.

It was stipulated and agreed between all parties to the suits which had been consolidated that if the Thompson mortgage dated October 10, 1926 (now held by Semple) “is still unpaid” it is superior to the lien of the W.

There is no contention here that the notice of lien which was filed by Drake Lumber Com<a id="p1762" href="#p1762" data-label="1762" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1762</a>pany on April 28, 1926, was within ninety days of the furnishing of the last material as required by statute to be effective in law. It is contended- however that inasmuch as all lienors may, under Section 5394 Compiled General Laws, 1927, consolidate and bring one suit to enforce their respective liens, that as the Thurston Company brought suit within one year of the furnishing of the material by the Drake Lumber Company, to which the latter, being made a party defendant, filed its appearance within one year, that being thus brought into the suit it was unnecessary to institute a separate suit when its claims could thereby be placed before the coui’t in an action to determine its rights. It appears that the Drake Lumber Company relies for its authority, among others, upon 18 R. C. L. 979, Section 120, and the cases there cited, wherein the general proposition is stated that if one lienor institutes a suit to enforce his lien and makes another lienor a party defendant, setting forth the latter’s recorded lien in his bill, that the court should determine the rights of the parties. It seems that the above, rule would apply only where the other suit to foreclose set forth “the latter’s recorded lien in his bill.” In the present case the amended bill of Thurston Company filed August 6, 1926, merely alleged that the defendant Drake Lumber Company has or claims to have some interest in the property by virtue of a lien filed for record April 28, 1926, inferior to complainant’s lien. The notice of lien of Drake Lumber Company, having been filed three months after the expiration of the ninety days from the last date of the furnishing of the material, is barred by the statute and such an allegation in the Thurs-ton bill could not have the effect of re-establishing or reviving it. The year within which the Drake Lumber Company could bring suit expired October 26, 1926. At that time only the appearance of the said company filed on <a id="p1763" href="#p1763" data-label="1763" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1763</a>September 6, 1926, was of record, except the notice of lien filed April 28, 1926, which, as above stated, was barred by the statute. A cross-bill of the Drake Lumber Company to the bill of the said Thurston Company was filed on November 29, 1926, which of course was more than a year from the last date of furnishing of material which was October 26, 1925.</p>
    <p id="b759-5" data-blocks='[["BL_759.5",759,[257,935,1102,950]]]'>While Section 5394, Compiled General Laws of Florida, 1927, permits lien claimants to file joint suits to enforce all liens claimed by such claimants, this was not done- in this case. It might be that if the Drake Lumber Company had filed its cross-bill fully setting up its claim within the year, it would have been a sufficient compliance with the statute. In the case of Baugher v. Cohen, <a href="/fla/98/1081-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Fla. 1081" data-case-ids="1302292" data-case-paths="/fla/98/1081-01">98 Fla. 1081</a>, 124 So.

Watson, Inc., <a href="/fla/96/0671-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="96 Fla. 671" data-case-ids="1248698" data-case-paths="/fla/96/0671-01">96 Fla. 671</a>, 123 So. R. 837, it was held that if it develops that the date for filing the suit was more than one year after the last furnishing of material, and that no notice had been filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, as by statute required, the suit would abate, because the lien expires by limitation at the end of twelve months from the last furnishing of materials, and when the lien shall have expired a suit cannot be maintained to enforce same.</p>

Davis, trustee, who thereupon endorsed the note and deposited same with the mortgage in a bank for collection. After the note and mortgage matured on January 10, 1926, the mortgagor advised Davis that George Whyel would buy the mortgage and thereupon Davis in due course executed and assigned it to Whyel; and then K. 0. Anderson of Anderson Properties, Inc., with two checks of Whyel made payable to Anderson, went to the bank and procured from the teller of the bank the mortgage and the note which had been previously endorsed by Davis for collection. The note was by mistake—so far as the intention of the parties to the transaction and this suit is concerned—stamped by the teller as “paid,” as he had no instructions from Davis that the latter was selling and assigning the note and mortgage to Whyel.</p>

Thurston Company, Inc., here is that the mortgage lien was inferior to its lien because the note was stamped “paid” by the bank’s teller and thereby the debt was <em>ipso facto </em>extinguished. It was stipulated at the beginning of the hearing before the general master that the sum of $10,000.00 plus $302.00 interest was paid to George N. Davis, trustee, on the 24th day of' February, 1926, and that this was the amount then due and owing, and that the said amount- was furnished by George Whyel; but that there was no intention on the part of the stipulators to agree that the <em>original note </em>secured by <a id="p1766" href="#p1766" data-label="1766" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1766</a>said mortgage was ever delivered to George Whyel or Edward L.

Thurston Company, by virtue of work done and material furnished, acquired a lien upon the premises in the sum of $29,180.34 with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from March 1, 1926, same being subordinate and inferior to the lien of the mortgage held by E.

Anderson, who handled the note and the accompanying transactions at the time of procuring the note and mortgage from the bank, taken before the chancellor himself, not only refutes his plea of payment, but shows that there was no intention on his part at the time of his getting the mortgage from the bank, to have the debt satisfied and marked or recorded as such. It is also clear that it was not the intention of George Whyel who furnished the money to purchase the debt, nor Geo. N. Davis who owned the note and mortgage, nor K. 0. Anderson who gave them, to cancel or satisfy the note and mortgage, and a mere mistake though unconsciously made by the bank’s teller, at the time of the delivery of the note to K. 0. Anderson, in stamping it “paid” does .not have such legal effect; furthermore, it would lend no verity to such contention for anyone knowing the facts to undertake to give it a meaning that could not be sustained.

Whether or not the burden of proof was on the complainant in foreclosure to establish that the cancellation was made by mistake, it could not seriously be contended that such proof was insufficient.
