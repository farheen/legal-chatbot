Thereafter, on February 19, 2003, the court filed an unpublished opinion and an accompanying order disposing of the motion. The court opined initially that, while the testimony of the House Members was credible, it could not, consistent with the enrolled bill doctrine, be given any weight. As to the substance of Petitioners’ allegations, the court indicated that Article III, Section 3 was designed to prevent abuses related to the practice of passing “omnibus” bills with hundreds of pages of unrelated provisions and little public notice as to their contents. It noted that, while the restrictions contained in Section 3’s text do not lend themselves to “bright line” rules, the procedure used in the present case “crossed th[e] line” as to what is acceptable under that provision.

The term “24 hour legislation” would seem to be more appropriate. However, it is exactly such “24 hour legislation” that the Constitutional amendments of 1874 were meant to prohibit. Unfortunately, the public had no indication that such radical changes in governance were being contemplated despite the fact that, as noted, the taxpayers will be footing the bill for all this. Pennsylvania is one of the few states that has incorporated, via its constitution, restraints upon the Legislature’s ability to propose and pass legislation without public notice. The foregoing scenario is exactly what the framers of the 1875[sic] Constitution meant to prevent.</blockquote>

Finally, the court found that delaying implementation of the Act would not harm Respondents, and that the public interest favored maintaining the status quo ante pending final resolution of the underlying constitutional claims on the merits.

The Commonwealth and the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority add that legislation may be materially altered during the course of its passage without impermissibly changing its purpose, and that this Court has never held otherwise.

Petitioners maintain that such limitations are designed to ensure open and honest government, and that the Commonwealth Court correctly determined that the voluminous last-minute changes to SB 1100 implicated the concerns that motivated the electorate in 1874 to adopt Article Ill’s procedural restrictions.

Here, however, Petitioners’ complaints stem from aspects of the bill under review that have particular application to Philadelphia. Therefore, Petitioners’ interest in the outcome of the litigation is substantial, as it surpasses that of Pennsylvania citizens generally in procuring obedience to the law. Furthermore, as all of the changes complained of flow from the enactment of Act 230, a causal connection exists between the asserted constitutional violation and the alleged harm.

As discussed, Respondents argue that standing is absent because all of the harms that Petitioners have asserted are remote and speculative, and Petitioners have not provided any factual support for its claims of injury. Certainly, allegations that the Act will hurt the City’s reputation, or that bookings at the Convention Center might decrease due to uncertainty as to whether an agreement will be reached with various labor unions, are indirect, remote and speculative. We are not aware of any Pennsylvania authority that supports the position that such abstract or uncertain harms are sufficient to confer standing. Moreover, there is nothing in the record tending to prove that bookings at the Convention Center will suffer, or have suffered, as a result of changes in the Convention Center’s governing board.</p>

For example, at the preliminary injunction hearing, Mr. Vignola provided credited testimony that Act 230’s repeal of Section 209(k) of the PICA Act will significantly interfere with PICA’s ability to perform its obligations under the cooperation agreement in existence between PICA and the City, because future City costs will no longer be subject to reliable estimation or control. The reason is that Section 209(k) required labor arbitrators to take into account the City’s existing five-year plan and its ability to pay for requested increases in salary and benefits for the City’s police officers and firefighters, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 12720.209(k)(l)-(2) (repealed), and these items comprise expenditures of $850,000,000, or over a quarter of the City’s annual operating budget. According to Mr. Vignola, with Section 209(k) no longer in effect, PICA will be unable to approve the City’s five-year plan, which will in turn cause PICA to withhold monetary grants and loans to the City. <em>See </em>53 P.S. §§ 12720.208-12720.210. The repeal of Section 209(k) also removes the City’s right to obtain judicial review of any award granted to its uniformed personnel, and specifically, review of whether the City’s financial plan and its ability to pay for the cost increases were adequately considered. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 12720.209(k)(3) (repealed). These repealed provisions were of substantial benefit to the City in its efforts to develop an approved financial plan, maintain its fiscal stability, and receive assistance from PICA. While Respondents contend that there is no record evidence that the loss of these rights will impose any immediate harm upon the City, the rights are valuable in themselves as they assure an arbitration and judicial review process that is objectively helpful to the City in controlling costs and receiving monetary assistance; thus, the City’s loss of such rights via Act 230 constitutes immediate harm.</p>

Under Act 230, whenever the contact amount exceeds $10,000, such businesses are subject to a bonding requirement of 200% of the value of the contract. <em>See </em>Act 230, §7; 53 Pa.C.S. § 5804(a). According to the Mayor, the City is involved in implementing a large-scale neighborhood transformation effort which depends upon small contractors to bid for and perform much of the work involved, and the 200% bonding requirement will interfere with this effort by effectively disqualifying a number of small contractors with whom the City could otherwise conduct business. We thus conclude that the City’s interest in having its small-scale contractors remain free of the 200% bonding requirement is sufficiently immediate to confer standing upon the City.</p>

In that matter, the Commonwealth Court indicated that, as a municipality created solely to carry out local governmental functions, Pittsburgh lacked standing to assert that the statute challenged there imposed an unequal tax burden upon its residents. The court reasoned that, as the residents of the municipality were the ones allegedly burdened by the statute, they were the proper parties to challenge the law, particularly as there was no allegation that the city’s local governmental functions were affected by the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 191-92, <a href="/pa-commw/112/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="535 A.2d 680" data-case-ids="1368037" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/112/0188-01">535 A.2d at 682</a>. Here, by contrast, Petitioners contend not only that the City’s residents will be subjected to an enhanced tax burden, but that the Act affects city governmental functions relative to collective bargaining, budget management, and urban renewal. Therefore, the City’s present assertion that it is an aggrieved party is premised upon the effects of Act 230 upon its interests and functions as a governing entity, and not merely upon harm to its citizens individually. Accordingly, we hold that the City’s interests, as delineated above, are sufficient to provide the City with standing to bring the present action. <em>Cf. Franklin Township v.

Petitioners contend that these failures in form and procedure deprived the public of adequate notice to participate in the legislative process, and the legislators of the opportunity to vote with circumspection. Respondents generally deny these allegations and argue that Act 230’s single subject is municipalities, that all of its provisions relate to this topic, and that the changes wrought by the bill are sufficiently reflected in its title. They point out that many sub-topics may be included in a bill, so long as they are all germane to a single general topic.

The body of the bill, as well, contains various provisions affecting municipalities in some fashion, sometimes only indirectly.

Respondents state that all such provisions relate to “municipalities,” but, as virtually all of local government is a “municipality,” we find that proposed subject too broad to qualify for single-subject status under Article III, Section 3. Whether or not it is akin to the “the business of the courts” or “the economic well being of the commonwealth”— proffered topics which, as noted, have been deemed overly broad to constitute a single subject for constitutional purposes — “municipalities” is the subject of an entire Title of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes.

Indeed, although respondent Convention Center Authority maintains that the “general subject matter of SB 1100 at all times was municipalities,” Brief at 33, in arguing that the City lacks standing, it stresses that Convention Center Authority is an instrument of the Commonwealth and not of any municipality. <em>See id. </em>at 27. We agree with this latter assessment because, while the convention center statute indicates that the building housing conventions is to be located in Philadelphia, that legislation also clarifies that the Convention Center Authority is a Commonwealth authority created to serve state-wide interests, and not a municipal authority, <em>see generally </em>53 Pa.C.S. §§ 5902-5923; 53 P.S. §§ 16201-16224 (repealed and recodified as amended at 53 Pa.C.S. §§ 5902-5923), and that that some of its governing members must be from outside of Philadelphia. <em>See, e.g., </em>53 Pa.

Therefore, based upon this example alone, Act 230 cannot reasonably be deemed to pertain only to the single topic of municipalities, and thus, cannot be seen as containing only a single subject for purposes of Article III, Section 3.

In this regard, the Authority takes issue with a portion of the Commonwealth Court analysis in which it noted that appropriation bills, which are also included within Section 3’s exception to the one-subject rule, <em>see id., </em>are separately constrained to a single subject under Section 11. <em>See </em>Pa. Const, art. Ill, § 11 (“The general appropriation bill shall embrace nothing but appropriations for the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the Commonwealth, for the public debt and for public schools. All other appropriations shall be made by separate bills, each embracing one subject.”) The Commonwealth Court reasoned that Section 11 was intended to restrict the power of the legislature as a trade-off for the appropriation-bill exemption in Section 3, and stated that, while a codification bill is not constitutionally defined, “by analogy” the same limits should apply to them. <em>See </em>Commonwealth Ct. op. at 19-20.</p>

These pre-1970 codifications merely represented attempts to classify and collect statutes, and did not result in true consolidated statutes. One hindrance to consolidation may have been the single-subject requirement of Section 3 — which originally did not exempt codifications or compilations — and the underlying concerns it represented. <em>See </em>Clark, <em>Introduction to Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, </em>at 14 (“The principal adverse comment expressed concerning codification is that ulti<a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>mately it could re-establish the ‘logrolling’ practices outlaws by the single subject requirement of Article III, § 3 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.”). Thus, in 1967, the exception for any “bill codifying or compiling the law or a part thereof’ was added to Section 3. Thereafter, in 1970, the General Assembly enacted a general “code” known as the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> which was originally the structural framework for the eventual consolidation of all Pennsylvania statutes— that is, a kind of “skeleton ... given body by addition of substantive provisions drafted as amendments to Act 230 [of 1970] under appropriate title headings.” Ruben-dall, <em>Constitution and Consolidated Statutes, </em>at 130.

Thus, we do not believe that the electorate, in approving the amendment to Section 3, intended to give the Legislature license to include, within any bill consolidating an existing statute, unrestricted substantive revisions to the law unrelated to the process of codification, as otherwise the one-subject provision would be of little value.

In making this argument, the Authority overlooks an important distinction between appropriation bills and codification bills: a legislative appropriation constitutes substantive law, as it allocates money, whereas a legislative codification leaves existing substantive law unchanged.

While the order in question directed the Commonwealth Court to resolve the underlying constitutional challenge on the merits, <em>see id. </em>at 431, <a href="/pa/568/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="798 A.2d 161" data-case-ids="163530,163631,9428469,9428595" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0430-01,/pa/568/0429-01,/a2d/798/0161-01,/a2d/798/0161-02">798 A.2d at 162</a>, several Justices of this Court filed accompanying statements addressing, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the Governor was an indispensable party to the litigation. All referred to the <em>CRY/Kline </em>standard, but with varying results. Mr. Justice Castille, joined by Mr. Justice Nigro, opined that the Governor was indeed a necessary party, in part because his appointment powers under the challenged legislation were the <em>"sine qua non " </em>of the dispute. <em>See id. </em>at 434, <a href="/pa/568/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="798 A.2d 161" data-case-ids="163530,163631,9428469,9428595" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0430-01,/pa/568/0429-01,/a2d/798/0161-01,/a2d/798/0161-02">798 A.2d at 164</a> (Castille, J., concurring). This author, by contrast, suggested that the Governor was not indispensable to the litigation because, once he had exercised his appointment powers, he maintained no further direct role in the implementation of the statute, thus rendering his interests insufficiently immediate and direct. <em>See id. </em>at 447-48, <a href="/pa/568/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="798 A.2d 161" data-case-ids="163530,163631,9428469,9428595" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0430-01,/pa/568/0429-01,/a2d/798/0161-01,/a2d/798/0161-02">798 A.2d at 172</a> (Saylor, J., concurring). Chief Justice Zappala, joined by then-Justice Cappy, now Chief Justice, stated that the Governor's appointive powers were not essential to a disposition of the substantive issues on the merits, and indicated that the "sheer number of gubernatorial appointments” made pursuant to Pennsylvania statutes and administrative regulations would render troublesome any holding that the Governor was indispensable. <em>See id. </em>at 467-68, <a href="/pa/568/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="798 A.2d 161" data-case-ids="163530,163631,9428469,9428595" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0430-01,/pa/568/0429-01,/a2d/798/0161-01,/a2d/798/0161-02">798 A.2d at 184</a> (Zappala, C.J., dissenting). In the present case, the Governor was made a party, and thus, we need not decide whether his participation is affirmatively required. Moreover, as none of the persons that Respondents claim are indispensable are Commonwealth parties, the disagreement reflected in <em>Philadelphia Parking Auth. </em>is not implicated here.</p>

Drafting a code includes compiling existing laws, systematically arranging them into chapters, subheads, tables of contents, and indexes, harmonizing conflicts, supplying omissions, and generally clarifying and completing a body of laws designed to regulate exhaustively the subjects to which it relates. A compilation, on the other hand, is merely an arrangement and classification of legislation in the exact form and wording in which it was enacted originally. It simply brings together in convenient form the various acts of the legislature over a period of time. Thus, a code is quite different from a compilation. A code is broader in scope and more comprehensive in purpose. Its general object is to embody, as nearly as practicable, all the statutory laws of a governmental entity. When properly adopted by the legislature, a code is more than prima facie evidence of the law; it is positive law itself. An officially or privately prepared compilation, however, is published only to facility discovery of the law. Usually a compilation does not eliminate repealed laws; instead it collects all laws on the same subject regardless of their operative effect. Even when a compilation has been given legislative approval, it does not affect the status of the law: final authority remains in the statutes as originally enacted.</blockquote>
