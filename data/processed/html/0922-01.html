They returned to Smothers’ property the next day, and he answered the door. When asked by the officer for crack cocaine, Smothers pointed to Boozer and said “he’s got it.” N.T. at p. 8.

Smothers testified that he did not witness the drug sale on March 23, 2004 and that he was unaware of anyone selling drugs on his property, although he admitted that he sporadically used drugs in the past but never engaged in drug sales.

The standard would be applied by comparing the amount of the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense, and if the amount of the forfeiture is in gross disproportion to the offense, it is unconstitutional. The court also enumerated factors limited to the conduct of the defendant for measuring the gravity of the offense, including a comparison of the penalty imposed to the maximum penalty available, a determination of whether the violation was isolated or was part of a pattern of misbehavior and an assessment of the harm that resulted from the offense charged. Considering all of these factors, the court ruled that forfeiture of the $357,144 would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that Smothers asserted only that forfeiture of the property was an excessive fine under the Pennsylvania Constitution as interpreted in <em>Commonwealth v. 4029 Beale Avenue, </em><a href="/pa/545/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="545 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="465096" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0172-01">545 Pa. 172</a>, <a href="/pa/545/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="680 A.2d 1128" data-case-ids="465096,7864433" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0172-01,/a2d/680/1128-01">680 A.2d 1128</a> (1996), and that because he relied on the "substantial use” test set forth in that case, not the gross disproportionality test, the latter cannot be considered on appeal, citing Pa. R.A.P. 302(a) (issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal). The Commonwealth explains that the "substantial use” test and the gross disproportionality test are distinct claims. In 1993 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court adopted the "substantial use” test in <em>In re King Properties, </em><a href="/pa/535/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="535 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1841480" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0321-01">535 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="635 A.2d 128" data-case-ids="1841480,7358854" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0321-01,/a2d/635/0128-01">635 A.2d 128</a> (1993), and determined that the inquiry did not concern the value of the thing forfeited but rather the relationship of the offense to the property. The Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v. 5444 Spruce Street, </em><a href="/pa/574/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="574 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="587998" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0423-01">574 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="832 A.2d 396" data-case-ids="587998,9086610" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0423-01,/a2d/832/0396-01">832 A.2d 396</a> (2003), overruled <em>King Properties </em>to the extent that it departed from the holding in <em>5444 Spruce Street. </em>Smothers raised an excessive fines claim in the trial court proceedings in his post-hearing brief, and the Court will consider Smothers’ claim in the context of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
