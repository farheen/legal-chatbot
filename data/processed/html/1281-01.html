First, Jackson argues that the Superior Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to sever the offenses, because the separate crimes for which he was indicted were not part of a common scheme or plan as required for joinder by Superior Court Criminal Rule 8(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Second, Jackson contends that the Superior Court erred when it failed to grant his motion to suppress the evidence seized after his January 20, 2007, arrest. He claims that the arrest was pre-textual and not based on facts that he had committed or was about to commit a crime. He further claims that the police illegally apprehended, detained and searched him in violation of the Delaware and United States Constitutions and that the evidence seized should have been suppressed as “fruit of the poisonous tree.”</p>

Dykes called the police and Officer Gerald Nagowski of the Wilmington Police Department went to Dykes’ home.

Herring radioed for assistance and broadcast a description of the driver as an African-American male, approximately six feet tall, thin build, medium dark to dark complexion, with facial hair, and wearing a golden-brown “puffy” coat. A K-9 unit responded to the scene and the police dog tracked the suspect from the abandoned car, south through Edgemoor, and in the direction of Merchants Square Shopping Center on Governor Printz Boulevard, north of the city of Wilmington. Several police officers set up a cordon in the area where the driver was likely to flee. Officer Daniel Guzevieh stationed himself in the Merchants Square Shopping Center.</p>

Guzevieh described the bicyclist as a tall, thin, African-American man, with facial hair and a dark complexion. The bicyclist was not wearing a “puffy” coat, but Guzevieh discounted this difference, because the suspect had fled half an hour earlier and had time to change his clothes. Guzevieh decided to question the man and drove toward him.</p>

The man Guzevieh arrested was later determined to be Wayne Jackson. The man who had abandoned his vehicle on Polk Drive was later determined to be Carrón Moon. The abandoned vehicle was registered to Terrance Tonic.</p>

In the bag Jackson had dropped, Guzevich found a laptop computer, another iPod, various cords for the iPod and computer, and a shattered glass coin bank with loose change. When Guzevich turned on the computer, it displayed the names of various members of the Callaghan family. The name “Eugene F. Callaghan” was also inscribed on the inside of the University of Delaware class ring. The police determined that a Eugene F. Callaghan lived at 191 Brandywine Boulevard, about half a mile from where Jackson was arrested. The police went to the Callaghan residence.</p>

The Superior Court denied the motion to sever on June 29, 2007. A hearing on the motion to suppress was held on August 24, 2007. The Superior Court later denied that motion.</p>

Jackson asserts that without evidence of a common scheme or plan to support the joinder of his offenses, he was fatally prejudiced because the jury: (1) improperly cumulated the evidence against him; (2) improperly used evidence of one crime to infer a general pattern of criminal behavior or a general criminal disposition; and (3) was confused and therefore unable to follow the evidence introduced. In addition, Jackson argues that the different charges against him required different witnesses and different evidence, and, therefore, any judicial economy by trying the charges together was minimal. Lastly, Jackson implies that the State had no compelling interest to oppose <a id="p1286" href="#p1286" data-label="1286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1286</a>his motion because he faced sentencing as a habitual offender and the possibility of life imprisonment if convicted of any one of the charges.

He asserts that the police lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop him because he was not engaged in any criminal conduct at the time. He argues that he was merely “riding a bicycle through a parking lot at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night and happened to be a thin, black man with facial hair.” Although he recognizes that the police were searching for a suspect described as a “black male, thin, six feet tall, dark complexion and with facial hair,” Jackson contends that the suspect had been wearing “a puffy jacket, golden brown in color” and was identified as Cor-ron Moon. Jackson argues that “[h]is jacket did not match that worn by [the] original suspect, Moon.” Therefore, he claims, his apprehension, detention and search violated the Delaware and United States Constitutions.
