Section 13(m) of the Drug Act simply requires the imposition of a license suspension “upon conviction” of violating any provision of the Act. The language is mandatory: when a licensee is convicted, a license suspension must occur. <em>See Plowman v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, <a href="/pa/535/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="535 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1841446" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0314-01">535 </a></em><a href="/pa/535/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="535 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1841446" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0314-01">Pa. 314</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="635 A.2d 124" data-case-ids="1841446,7358765" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0314-01,/a2d/635/0124-01">635 A.2d 124</a> (1993). Thus, <em>each </em>conviction must result in a period of suspension. Since we have held that enhancement, that is, <em>increasing </em>penalties for subsequent offenses, is not appropriate without providing an opportunity for the offender to reform after a conviction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> multiple convictions, such as in this case, must result in multiple “first offense” suspensions. <em>Brosius. </em>This result is in accord with Section 13(m)(l), which evidences the General Assembly’s intent to provide for multiple suspensions which arise out of single criminal proceeding, where multiple counts are charged.</p>

      <em> </em>In that case, consideration of whether the licensee’s multiple violations arose from a single criminal act was only relevant for determining whether to apply the <em>enhancement </em>provisions of Section 13(m)(2) and (3), and not whether a penalty should be imposed in the first instance. Here, the Licensee committed three separate and distinct acts on three different days <a id="p782" href="#p782" data-label="782" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*782</a>which resulted in three separate violations of the Drug Act. The fact that the circumstances on each separate occasion were similar and within a single week, does not require the conclusion that the three convictions arose from the same criminal act, as we held in <em>Perruso.

Although this court now evidently thinks otherwise, I still agree with <em>Hardy. </em>Indeed, where a licensee has more than one conviction for violations of the Drag Act, logic demands that those convictions subsequent to the first offense cannot also be first offenses.
