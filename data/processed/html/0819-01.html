We affirm.</p>

    <p id="b852-6" data-blocks='[["BL_852.8",852,[209,1349,757,978]]]'>The Board and the trial court set forth the following relevant facts in their decisions. The School District is the equitable owner of the subject property located at North 25th Street and Filbert Avenue in Mount Penn, Berks County in a primarily residential area. The property consists of a vacant 110,000 square foot school building, including a gymnasium and an auditorium, on a 1.72-acre lot. The property was previously occupied by the Mount Penn High School from 1920s until 1989 when it was sold to A &amp; C Building and Industrial Maintenance Corporation (A &amp; C Corp.). The property has since been vacant and is in a state of disrepair. Due to the series of additions to the original building since 1925, the school building occupies almost the entire lot.</p>
    <p id="b852-7" data-blocks='[["BL_852.9",852,[211,2353,755,248]],["BL_852.10",852,[1013,283,756,1368]]]'>In recent years, the School District has experienced significant growth in student population and is in dire need of additional classroom spaces to meet the regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Education (Department). The existing elementary school is overcrowded and considered “undersized” under the Department’s standards. In addition, the School District has only one school gymnasium and no school auditorium within its district. The School District considered following options for expanding classrooms: adding classrooms at the existing elementary school at a cost of $2,000,000; adding classrooms and an auditorium at the middle/senior high school at a cost of $2,000,000; adding ten classrooms and a multi-purpose room on the former City of Reading water filter beds at a cost of $8,000,000; and repurchasing and renovating the subject property at a cost of $5,500,000. The School District determined that the last option would provide more flexibilities because the already existing vacant classrooms could be easily renovated to meet the current and future needs of the growing student population, and because the gymnasium and auditorium in the school building could also be used by students attending other schools within its district.</p>
    <p id="b852-10" data-blocks='[["BL_852.12",852,[1010,1683,755,916]],["BL_853.1",853,[95,278,753,507]]]'>On November 19, 2001, the School District entered into an agreement of sale with A &amp; C Corp. to repurchase the subject property for $225,000. The agreement was contingent upon obtaining zoning and land use approval required for reestablishing a school on the property. Section 433.E of the Borough of Mount Penn Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance) permits a “[njursery school, elementary school, middle school, junior high school or senior high school” by a special exception in the R-4 Suburban Residential zoning district where the property is located. Any uses accessory to the principal uses listed in Section 433.E also require a special exception under Section 433.G. The former Mount Penn High School existed <a id="p823" href="#p823" data-label="823" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*823</a>on the subject property as a preexisting nonconforming use before it was abandoned in 1989. Because the nonconforming use has since been continuously abandoned, the School District was required to obtain zoning approval to reestablish a school under Section 604 of the Ordinance prohibiting reestablishment of a preexisting nonconforming use after abandonment for a continuous eighteen-month period.</p>
    <p id="b853-5" data-blocks='[["BL_853.4",853,[97,812,754,708]]]'>On December 5, 2001, the School District filed an application with the Board, seeking (1) a special exception under Section 438.E of the Ordinance to establish an elementary school on the subject property; (2) a special exception from the area, yai'd and height regulations under Sections of 434, 435 and 501 through 525; (3) a variance from Section 512.14.N requiring one off-street parking space per one employee of an elementary school; and (4) interpretation that the subject building is a preexisting nonconforming structure under the Ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b853-6" data-blocks='[["BL_853.5",853,[99,1555,753,1129]]]'>At hearings before the Board, the School Distinct proposed to renovate the school building on the subject property to add ten classrooms for approximately 141 students in kindergarten, pre-first and first grades and spaces for the school staff. The School District also proposed to renovate the former high school gymnasium and auditorium in the school building. The renovated gymnasium will have more than 700 seats, locker rooms and a machine shop area, and the auditorium will have 500 to 600 seats. Under the proposal, the renovated gymnasium and auditorium will be used by not only the students attending the proposed elementary school but also those attending other schools within the School District for interscholastic sports, intramural activities and other school-related gatherings and events. The facilities will also be used for occasional community events.</p>
    <p id="b853-7" data-blocks='[["BL_853.6",853,[895,275,753,612]]]'>As to off-street parking, the School District proposed to use the street fronting the school building for dropping off and picking up the students by school buses and cars. Fifteen to twenty employees at the proposed elementary school will park their cars on Filbert Avenue and Endlich Avenue fronting the sides of the school building. The School District’s witnesses estimated that nineteen parking spaces were available on those streets during usual school days.</p>
    <p id="b853-8" data-blocks='[["BL_853.7",853,[898,914,755,819]]]'>During the hearings, the Board permitted the School District to amend the application to include the following additional and alternative zoning relief: (1) a special exception from Section 431 of the Ordinance setting forth the legislative intent for the R-4 zoning district; (2) a special exception under Section 433.G to establish a gymnasium and an auditorium as an accessory use; and (3) a variance from Section 512.14.K and P requiring one off-street parking space per every four seats of “Auditorium, ... or Other Place of Assemblage,” and one off-street parking space per fifty square feet of “Indoor Recreational Establishment,” respectively.</p>

They testified as to the School District’s need for additional classroom spaces and the flexibility of renovating the vacant school building with the gymnasium and auditorium to meet the current and future needs. The real estate expert testified that all previous efforts to develop the subject property for other purposes had failed, that other uses would require additional zoning relief, and that the highest and best use of the subject property was to use it as a school. The School District’s architect testified that removal of the rear portion of the school <a id="p824" href="#p824" data-label="824" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*824</a>building to provide off-street parking spaces would cost $800,000, making it economically infeasible, and that removal of some additions to the budding would be impossible because of structural and/or location concerns. The school superintendent testified that if the gymnasium was to be removed for parking spaces, the elementary school students would not have a play area. Finally, the witnesses stated that the proposed use would not adversely affect the traffic conditions in the area of the proposed school and that relocating some students to the proposed school would relieve the traffic congestion and parking problems existing in the area of the current elementary school.</p>
    <p id="b854-4" data-blocks='[["BL_854.4",854,[204,1177,753,405]]]'>The Krafczeks and Noble Realty, the adjacent property owners, entered appearances to oppose the School District’s proposal and presented the testimony of area residents who expressed their concerns over the parking problems and traffic congestion in the area. Other residents testified in favor of the proposal.</p>

The Board concluded that the School District was not required to obtain a variance from the area, yard and height regulations because the subject building was a preexisting nonconforming structure. The Board further concluded that as an accessory use, the proposed gymnasium and auditorium were not subject to the off-street parking requirements under Section 512.14.K and P. In granting the requested zoning relief, the Board required the School District to seek additional relief, in the event that the number of employees at the elementary school exceeds twenty or that it plans to further expand classrooms in the subject building. The Board also ordered the School District to investigate a possibility of acquiring off-street parking spaces from the area businesses and churches and submit evidence of such efforts to the Borough.</p>
    <p id="b854-9" data-blocks='[["BL_854.7",854,[1006,828,752,1383]]]'>The Krafczeks and Noble Realty appealed the Board’s decision to the trial court. Mitchell, who resides near the subject property, also appealed alleging that notice of hearings was not properly given. After a hearing, the trial court subsequently granted the School District’s petitions to intervene in the appeals and consolidate the appeals. After a separate hearing, the trial court denied the School District’s petition to compel the Krafczeks, Noble Realty and Mitchell to post a bond. The trial court affirmed, after argument of counsel, the Board’s decision to grant a special exception under Section 433.E of the Ordinance to permit the proposed elementary school and a variance from the off-street parking requirement for the elementary school under Section 512.14.N. The trial court then modified the Board’s grant of a special exception for an accessory use of the gymnasium and auditorium under Section 433.G limiting the use of those facilities to the students attending the elementary school. Both the School District and the Objectors appealed the trial court’s decision to this Court.</p>

Because of such topography and lack of available parking spaces on the lot, the only way to provide off-street parking is to demolish a portion of the building. Demolition of some part of the building, however, will present structural problems to the remaining building.
