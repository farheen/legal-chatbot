The water-insoluble soap “curd” thus formed detracts from the detergent action of the soap and forms an unsightly scum on the surface of the washing solution. On rinsing, the scum forms a deposit upon the skin and upon the containers employed for the washing operation, such as bathtubs, .sinks, washing machines and the like. The presence of this material is objectionable and in effect results in incomplete cleaning.</blockquote>

When a water-soluble soap is added to hard water, the soap combines with •calcium and magnesium ions and precipitates as a water-insoluble calcium and ■magnesium soap. <em>As long as the concentration of soap in the solution remains above the foaming level, or if non-soap detergents are present at a concentration sufficient to provide a foaming action, the water-insoluble lime soaps remain fairly well dispersed. </em>However, when the solution is diluted as by rinsing to the extent that the foaming and dispersing power of the water-soluble soap .-and/or detergent disappears, the lime soaps precipitate to form a sticky and unsightly surface scum. In the usual washing process, the dilution is carried •out with water containing additional hardness ions so that additional lime soaps may be formed. * * *</blockquote>

The sulfonates are prepared by alkylating benzene with a mixture-of alpha-olefins of the formula CH3(CH2)nCH = CIi2, where n = 9-15. The alkylbenzenes are sulfonated to produce alkylbenzenesulfonic-acids which in turn are neutralized to produce the desired salt. In addition to producing alkylbenzenes of varying alkyl chain length,, the alkylation reaction yields a mixture of isomers in which the-benzene ring is attached to various <em>internal </em>carbon atoms of any given alkyl chain, as illustrated by the formula in claim 1 reproduced below. At the concentrations employed, the alkylbenzenesulfonates' utilized by appellants are said to avoid the processing problems and to impart lime-soap dispersing properties “considerably superior” to like properties imparted by straight chain, <em>normal </em>alkylben-zenesulfonates of the formula CH3-(CH2)n-C6H,rSOsM, where the-alkyl group is attached terminally, not <em>internally, </em>to the benzene<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> ring.

Both felt that it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill to substitute the specifically disclosed detergents of Baumgartner and Hewitt for those of Flett and Hoyt, particularly in view of the known advantages disclosed by the secondary references for those particular alkylbenzenesulfonate detergents.</p>
    <p id="b766-4" data-blocks='[["BL_766.4",766,[224,595,1328,695]]]'>Appellants’ arguments are, in the main, two-fold. They first contend that neither Baumgartner nor Hewitt suggests that the particular alkylbenzenesulfonates employed by appellants and disclosed by those references would be an effective lime-soap dispersant. The mere fact that those sulfonates are said to be superior detergents,, appellants state, does not mean they necessarily would be considered suitable lime-soap dispersants. Nor, they say, does Flett teach that any and all detergents are useful lime-soap dispersants, but teaches only that the class of alkylbenzenesulfonates disclosed by him are so useful. Secondly, appellants contend that none of the references suggests that the “stickiness” problem encountered by the prior art with the use of certain alkylbenzenesulfonates in the manufacture of soap bars could be overcome, without the use of starch, by utilizing the instant class of alkylbenzenesulfonates.</p>

They seem to equate Fletf’s “keryl” sul-fonates only with the straight chain <em>normal </em>alkylbenzenesulfonates described as known detergents and lime-soap dispersants in their specification. That does not appear to be entirely the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is apparent that Flett discloses among other things the use of straight chain “keryl” benzene sulfonates which, following the definition of Hewitt, include relatively large amounts of compounds having a straight chain hydrocarbon containing 12-16 carbon atoms medially or more centrally attached to the benzene radical. Those materials do not appear to differ substantially from appellants’ and are included <a id="p1427" href="#p1427" data-label="1427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1427</a>within those disclosed by Flett to be lime-soap dispersants at concentration levels comparable to those employed by appellants. We cannot agree that one of ordinary skill in the art would be unaware that the rather large class of alkylbenzenesulfonates recited in appellants’ claims would possess lime-soap dispersant properties. The fact that Hewitt discloses that the instant alkylbenzenesul-fonates possess good foaming properties would, following the criterion established in appellants’ specification, provide some further suggestion of the lime-soap dispersing properties of those materials.</p>
    <p id="b767-4" data-blocks='[["BL_767.4",767,[95,698,1332,347]]]'>With regard to appellants’ second point, there does appear to be some unresolved inconsistency between the earlier disclosure of Flett that “stickiness” is no problem at “keryl” benzene sulfonate concentrations less than 66% of the weight of fatty acid soap in the bar and the later disclosure of Hoyt that “stickiness” becomes a problem at “keryl” benzene sulfonate concentrations greater than 15% of the weight of soap, thus necessitating the use of starch.</p>
    <p id="b767-5" data-blocks='[["BL_767.5",767,[96,1051,1336,948]]]'>Granted the problem exists, it seems to have been quite universal, whether attempts were made to employ the highly branched or keryl benzene sulfonates of the prior art in compositions with water-soluble soaps (Hoyt), or in compositions without them (as reported by Hewitt). It appears to us, as it did to the examiner, that Hewitt’s •discovery that certain alkylbenzenesulfonates, corresponding in large measure to those appearing in appellants’ claims, would solve certain “milling” and “plodding” difficulties if employed in synthetic detergent bars would suggest to one of ordinary skill that a similar problem in Flett’s or Hoyt’s compositions might be solved if those compounds were employed in the course of manufacturing bars containing both fatty acid soaps and alkylbenzenesulfonates. Appellants provide no answer to the examiner’s line of reasoning in arguing that the technology of making bars from synthetic detergent is somehow “quite distinct” from the technology of making bars based largely on soap. Nor does the examiner’s reasoning appear to involve :any elements of “obvious to try” as asserted by appellants.
