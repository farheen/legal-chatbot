On December 19, 1976, Cabral was indicted for rape and indecent assault on Marilyn, then aged seven, and for rape and indecent assault on Shawn, then aged eleven.</p>

The girls lived in this development, and Cabral was employed there as a maintenance man. During the course of the trial, the trial justice granted Cabral’s motion for acquittal on both counts of rape. The jury acquitted Cabral on the charge of indecent assault against Shawn but found him guilty of indecent assault against Marilyn. Thereafter, the trial justice denied Cabral’s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to a <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>five-year term in the Adult Correctional Institutions with the imposition of four years of that sentence suspended. Cabral has been free on bail pending the disposition of his appeal.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[212,502,751,555]]]'>The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the testimony of a complainant of tender age in a prosecution for a sexual offense must be corroborated. This court concludes that corroboration is not required.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We have reached this conclusion after a review of common law principles, statutory provisions in our own and neighboring states, and the balancing of interests, societal and individual, in the ascertainment of truth and determination of credibility.</p>

Ill, sec. 3, sets forth a corroboration requirement to prove a charge of treason, there is no such requirement prescribed for the prosecution of sex crimes. In Rhode Island, by statute, treason is the only crime which requires corroborative proof. G.L. 1956 (1969 Reenactment) § 11— 43-2. The General Assembly at its January 1979 session enacted P.L. 1979, ch. 302, An Act Relating to Rape and Seduction, which repealed in its entirety G.L. 1956 (1969 Reenactment) chapter 37 of title 11. Section 11-37-11 of the new act specifically states: “The testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in prosecutions under this chapter.” Since Cabral’s trial and conviction precede the 1979 legislation, § 11-37-11 has no bearing on this appeal, except to show that the Legislature has now codified the common law.</p>

Finally, the purpose of the- rule is already completely attained by the judge’s power to set aside a verdict upon insufficient evidence, and under this power verdicts are constantly set aside, in jurisdictions having no statutory rule, upon the same evidence which in other jurisdictions would be insufficient under the statutory rule requiring corroboration.</blockquote>

Many of these concerns have their origins in the writings of Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench of 1671 to 1676. Hale, in dealing at length with the subject of rape, wondered whether prosecutrixes under the age of twelve should be allowed to testify at all. He recommended that such a victim’s tale should always be put before the jury under oath if the court in its discretion felt the witness qualified to be sworn, but otherwise as a sworn statement. It was in this context that Hale went on to write these words:</p>

Most women, when confronted with a weapon-wielding assailant, make the sensible decision not to resist physically. Thus, they lack the bruises and torn clothing that would otherwise corroborate the crime. Juvenile complainants are more likely to be attacked by someone with whom they are acquainted and, therefore, are less likely to encounter a weapon and threat of battery and are less likely to scream and resist.

There is a great deal of difference between the times in seventeenth-century England when Sir Matthew was writing about his experience as a jurist and today in the United States. Here in this country an accused is entitled to all of the constitutional and procedural safeguards of our criminal justice system. The trial justice is bound to charge the jury as to the presumption of innocence and the state’s burden of proving all elements of a particular offense beyond a ■ reasonable doubt. The Sixth Amendment gives to an accused the right to an attorney and to present defense witnesses and compel their attendance. Additional protection against any evidentiary insufficiency is afforded in the Rules of Criminal Procedure by way of a motion for judgment of acquittal or a motion for new trial. Further, a child may not testify unless and until the trial justice has been satisfied that the proposed witness can (1) observe, (2) recollect, (3) communicate (a capacity to understand questions and to furnish intelligent answers), and (4) appreciate the necessity of telling the truth.
