Furthermore, the dressing table is mounted on a cross rail joining the upper ends of the legs at one end of the tub. This dressing table is drawn over the tub and supported by the same during use.

    <blockquote id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[148,685,1326,532]]]'>Claims 1, 2, and 3 are deemed unpatentable over either Hagstrom or Park in v-ewte [view] of any of the patents to Rohe, Mitrucker, and Freytag. These claims differ from Hagstrom or Park by defining the specific mounting for the dressing table. Appellants urge that they are not claiming broadly the mounting, but are claiming the general organization, and that it is improper to consider the mountings disclosed in Rohe, Mitrucker, and Freytag, because they are disclosed in nonanalogous art. However, it is our view that since the general organization is shown in Hagstrom and Park and since the specific form of connection is shown in the other references the claims fail to define invention. We believe that there would be no invention in attaching the dressing tables to the bathtubs in Hagstrom and Park in the manner that the folding members are attached to their supporting structures in other references.</blockquote>
    <p id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.6",383,[147,1246,1326,698]]]'>It is contended by appellants that three of the cited references are from nonanalogous arts; that is is not proper to combine those with the patents to Park and Hagstrom; that appellants’ structure is more compact and occupies less space when in use, and is less complicated, cumbersome, and expensive than the device disclosed in the patent to Park; that the so-called dressing table of flexible fibrous material wound upon a spool or drum at one end of the frame, and adapted to be stretched across the top of the tub and secured to the opposite end of the frame, disclosed in the patent to'Hagstrom, is a “very different thing, of course, from the applicant’s rigidly framed and substantial table with its bodily endwise sliding and transversly swinging association with the tub ”; and that, while the elements •of appellants’ device are old, they have been so combined structurally as to produce a new and useful result.</p>
    <p id="b383-6" data-blocks='[["BL_383.7",383,[147,1952,1325,185]]]'>It is true that appellants’ device is more compact and requires less space, when in use, than the structure disclosed in the patent to Park. So far as we can see, it has no other material advantages ■over the Park device.</p>
    <p id="b383-7" data-blocks='[["BL_383.8",383,[147,2153,1325,295]],["BL_384.1",384,[230,228,1327,346]]]'>The device disclosed in the patent to Hagstrom is just as compact •and occupies no more space, at any time, than that of appellants. Although it is argued that the dressing table of fibrous material in Hagstrom’s structure is less rigid than appellants’ dressing table, it does not necessarily follow that this is so. The rigidity of Hag-strom’s dressing table depends, to a considerable extent, upon how <a id="p934" href="#p934" data-label="934" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*934</a>tightly it is stretched across the tub. The question of rigidity or strength is merely a matter of degree; and if it be assumed that appellants’ dressing table is more rigid than the one shown in the-patent to Hagstrom, due to the fact that it has a frame, we are of opinion, nevertheless, that this is not a patentable distinction. We are in accord with the views expressed by the Board of Appeals» and its decision is <em>affirmed.</em>
