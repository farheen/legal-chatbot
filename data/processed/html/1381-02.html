Her granddaughter, Treneta Marie Humphries, retained Ray to assist her with Ms. Williams’ estate. Although he had previously been given permission to appear in two personal injury cases in Maryland, Ray was not a member of the Maryland Bar. Moreover, Ray, who was employed as an attorney at the United States Department of Labor, had never probated an estate.</p>

    <p id="b1445-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1445.14",1445,[999,571,753,521]]]'>Acting on Ms. Humphries’ behalf, Ray requested the Prince George’s County Register of Wills to release Leola Williams’ will and to open a file for her estate. Ray also prepared an inventory of the assets in the estate, and filed it with the court in March of 1987. Meanwhile, Ms. Humphries opened a checking account for the estate. As the appointed personal representative, Ms. Humphries was the only person authorized to sign checks on this account.</p>

    <p id="b1445-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1445.16",1445,[1000,1458,757,714]]]'>Ray testified that Ms. Humphries had agreed to pay him $3,000 for his assistance in liquidating securities involved in the estate and for representing her as an heir of the estate, as well as for his assistance with other related “legal problems.” He subsequently asserted in a letter to Bar Counsel that he had “assisted] Ms. Humphries in probating the estate,” but he defended his actions on the ground that she could have proceeded without the aid of a retained attorney. In the same letter, Ray also claimed that an official at the office of the Register of Wills told him that he could assist Ms. Humphries even if he was not a Maryland attorney.</p>

Ray denied drafting the document, notwithstanding the presence of a draft copy in his files. Instead, he claimed that he had only reviewed the document.

The Accounting also showed distributions to each of the four heirs (one of whom was Ms. Humphries) in the approximate amount of $21,750. The court approved the First and Final Accounting on November 10, 1988.</p>

Following an evidentiary hearing, the Hearing Committee found by clear and convincing evidence that Ray had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and that he had handled a matter which he was not competent to handle. The Committee found the evidence insufficient to show that Ray’s actions constituted fraud, deceit, misrepresentation or dishonesty. The Committee also concluded that Bar Counsel had failed to prove that Ray had engaged in misappropriation or that he had collected an illegal fee. The Hearing Committee recommended a 30-day suspension.</p>

Ray does not challenge the Board’s holding that he engaged in unauthorized practice or that he handled a matter which he was not competent to handle. We do not address these aspects of the Board’s Report, except to note that the findings are plainly supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Kennedy v.

The Hearing Committee’s finding that there was no misappropriation was based on an apparent misapprehension as to the law. According to the Committee, DR 9-103(A) prohibited only "intentional or reckless misappropriation of funds.” In fact, this Rule proscribed <em>any </em>misappropriation; the presence or absence of intentional or reckless conduct goes only to the proper sanction.</p>

Ray contends that the securities in question were not estate assets, but belonged to Ms. Hum-phries’ grandfather, who predeceased Ms. Williams. The Hearing Committee found the contrary, however, and by failing to contest the Committee’s finding, Ray has waived the point. <em>James, <a href="/a2d/452/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="452 A.2d 163" data-case-ids="7967375" data-case-paths="/a2d/452/0163-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/452/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="452 A.2d 163" data-case-ids="7967375" data-case-paths="/a2d/452/0163-01">452 A.2d at 168-69</a>.</p>

In <em>Pels, </em>the respondent engaged in the "indiscriminate mingling” of client funds over a period of almost a year, which resulted, <em>inter alia, </em>in the repeated dishonoring of checks to one of the client’s medical care providers. Moreover, there was a bitter dispute between Pels and his client, as a result of which Pels resorted to self-help. In the present case, by contrast, Ray’s client was satisfied with his services, a factor which we deem relevant, though obviously not conclusive. <em>See Addams, <a href="/a2d/579/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="579 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="7356987" data-case-paths="/a2d/579/0190-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/579/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="579 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="7356987" data-case-paths="/a2d/579/0190-01">579 A.2d at 199</a>.</p>

There, the Hearing Committee which heard the evidence found that Addams <em>dishonestly </em>misappropriated his client’s funds, with a "reckless disregard" of her financial security. See the division opinion, <em>In re Addams, </em><a href="/a2d/563/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="563 A.2d 338" data-case-ids="7347654" data-case-paths="/a2d/563/0338-01">563 A.2d 338</a>, 339 (D.C.1989) (per curiam).

We note that the Hearing Committee, which heard Ray testify, made a number of credibility determinations unfavorable to him. Any impartial reader of the Committee’s findings will conclude that, at best, Ray was not as candid as he ought to have been.</p>
