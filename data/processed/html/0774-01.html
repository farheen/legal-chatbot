In 1991, when the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) learned that she was maintaining an office and practicing law in Delaware, Glover consented to the entry of a cease and desist order. In 2006, the ODC filed a petition alleging that Glover has been violating the cease and desist order, and that her activities in Delaware constitute the unauthorized practice of law. A panel of the Board on Professional Responsibility (“Board”) issued its report recommending, among other things, that Glover be declared permanently unfit for admission to the Delaware bar. Glover objected to the Board’s findings and recommendations. After careful consideration, we conclude that Glover must be disbarred.</p>

She moved to Delaware a few years later. In 1989, Glover was admitted to practice in Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. She took the Delaware bar examination, but did not pass. In 1990, Glover opened a law office in her home in Milford, Delaware. Glover’s practice included federal immigration law and personal injury cases.</p>

Glover entered into a Statement and Order of Voluntary Compliance (the “Cease and Desist Order”), which was approved by this Court on December 20, 1991. The Cease and Desist Order provided, in relevant part, that Glover had been “actively engaged in the practice of law in Milford, Delaware ...” and that Glover “shall immediately cease and desist from the performance of any and all legal services in Delaware for a fee, or for no fee, including, without limitation, the offering and providing of assistance in legal matters, until such time as she is properly admitted to practice as a member of the bar of the State of Delaware .... ”</p>

In 1991, Glover was convicted of bribing a federal immigration official, and served 37 months in prison. Following her conviction, Glover was disbarred in Pennsylvania, Ohio and the District of Columbia. She was reinstated in Pennsylvania in 2002.</p>
    <p id="b824-12" data-blocks='[["BL_824.10",824,[989,1275,753,923]]]'>Shortly after she was reinstated, Glover claims that she contacted the Pennsylvania Ethics Hotline to find out whether she could conduct “pre-litigation” meetings with Delaware clients who had personal injury claims arising from Delaware accidents. Louise M. Lamoreaux, the person who would have responded to such a call, did not have any records showing whether Glover had called. Lamoreaux explained that she would have advised Glover to contact the appropriate Delaware authorities. Lamoreaux also would have advised Glover that pre-litigation meetings with Delaware clients would not violate the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct as long as the Pennsylvania lawyer was not appearing in Delaware tribunals.</p>

In June 2005, after following up on information provided by a Delaware lawyer, the ODC notified Glover of its concerns about her Delaware activities. Shortly thereafter, she transferred more than 60 Delaware files to Delaware lawyers. In all, the ODC established that, from 2003-2006 Glover represented more than 100 Delaware residents in Delaware matters.

The Board evaluated the aggravating and mitigating factors, and recommended that Glover be declared permanently unfit for admission to the Delaware bar.

    <p id="b825-14" data-blocks='[["BL_825.14",825,[967,1550,756,611]]]'>Glover first argues that the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider her alleged misconduct. She contends that, under Rule 19 of the Rules of the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law (the “UPL Rules”), the ODC was required to file a contempt proceeding to enforce the Cease and Desist Order. In addition, Glover argues that the Board lacked jurisdiction under Rule 8.5(a) because she did not provide legal services in Delaware. These arguments lack merit.</p>
    <p id="b825-15" data-blocks='[["BL_825.15",825,[969,2185,756,248]]]'>First, nothing in UPL Rule 19 limits the ODC’s authority to institute a disciplinary proceeding against a lawyer who engages in professional misconduct. UPL Rule 19 provides, in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b826-4" data-blocks='[["BL_826.5",826,[186,871,754,561]]]'>We agree with Glover, that the ODC could have relied on UPL Rule 19 to seek enforcement of the Cease and Desist Order. But, in this case, the same conduct that would have supported a finding of contempt under UPL Rule 19, also would constitute knowing disobedience of a court order in violation of Rule 3.4(c). The ODC, in a proper exercise of its discretion, elected to proceed under the lawyer disciplinary rules.</p>
    <p id="b826-5" data-blocks='[["BL_826.6",826,[186,1459,753,143]]]'>Glover also argues that jurisdiction cannot be predicated on Rule 8.5, which provides in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b826-12" data-blocks='[["BL_826.12",826,[987,993,754,1029]]]'>Glover’s argument fails for several reasons. First, the record establishes that on three occasions she was physically present in Delaware, representing her Delaware clients. Second, physical presence is not required to establish that a person is providing, or offering to provide, legal services in this state.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> For several years, Glover accepted new clients who were: 1) Delaware residents, 2) involved in Delaware car accidents, and 3) seeking recovery under Delaware insurance policies. Glover did everything short of appearing in Delaware courts, and engaged Delaware attorneys as co-counsel only if she could not resolve the matter without litigation. We are satisfied that this regular pattern of representation of Delaware clients constituted the practice of law “in Delaware” for purposes of Rule 8.5.</p>

She points to no testimony to support a “reasonable belief’ that the “predominant effect” of her representation of Delaware clients was in Pennsylvania. Even if she harbored such a belief, the Board rejected Glover’s “state of mind” defense in finding that she knowingly violated the <a id="p779" href="#p779" data-label="779" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*779</a>Cease and Desist Order.

We disagree. Glover’s Delaware clientele did not seek her out at random. She lived in Delaware<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>, was active in church groups, and worked in her husband’s medical office before and after she was reinstated in Pennsylvania. Many of Glover’s Delaware clients were her husband’s patients or people she met through church activities.

She again points out that she contacted the Pennsylvania Ethics Hotline and argues that she was “given a green light to proceed.” If, in fact, Glover did contact the Pennsylvania authorities, she was told to contact the appropriate officials in Delaware for an answer to her question. Glover did not contact anyone in Delaware. From this fact, alone, the Board could properly infer that Glover knew that the Delaware authorities would give her a different answer. In addition, there can be no doubt but that Glover knew she was violating the Cease and Desist Order on the three occasions when she came to Delaware to participate in legal proceedings on her clients’ behalf.

Although it has limited relevance, the evidence suggests that Glover still lives in Delaware. She testified that her husband and children live in their home in Dover, Delaware, but that she is "legally” a resident of Pennsylvania and that she sleeps in her office. When asked whether she and her husband are separated, however, Glover said, "No.”</p>

Glover’s brief also mentions two alleged "flaws” in the Board proceedings: 1) the chair of the Board panel should have been disqualified because his law firm represents Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, and one of ODC’s witnesses was a Nationwide attorney; and 2) despite her objection, Charles Slanina, Esquire, was permitted to give prejudicial hearsay testimony. It does not appear that the first issue was presented to the Board, and Glover has offered no support for her suggestion that the "relationship" between the Board member and the witness warranted disqualification. As to the second "flaw,” the purported hearsay testimony actually was an attempt to refresh Sla-nina’s recollection of the scope of his 1991 investigation into Glover's Delaware practice. After reading the memorandum objected to by Glover, Slanina was able to confirm, from his refreshed recollection, that he presented information about Glover’s personal injury practice in Delaware to the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law. Thus, even if it was error to allow the memorandum into evidence, Slanina’s independent testimony about the scope of the 1991 investigation was admissible and Glover suffered no prejudice.</p>
