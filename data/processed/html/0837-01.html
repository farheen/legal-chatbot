    <p id="b870-15" data-blocks='[["BL_870.17",870,[998,778,752,468]]]'>As to the first contention, we see nothing in the legislative histories of the Statutes to persuade us that the holding in <em>Sapp </em>is wrong. Under § 6111, the Department is required to pay all “costs” of the condemnation proceeding. Such “costs” unquestionably include ordinary witness fees; we are satisfied that, by virtue of § 8906, such “costs” may also include expert witness fees.</p>
    <p id="b870-16" data-blocks='[["BL_870.18",870,[997,1288,750,135]]]'>As to the second argument, differences in statutory provisions make cases from other jurisdictions inapposite.</p>
    <p id="b870-17" data-blocks='[["BL_870.19",870,[999,1459,749,233]]]'>As to the third contention, the imposition of all “costs” upon the Department by the express provision of § 6111 results in giving the property owner a preferred position in this respect in all condemnation cases.</p>
    <p id="b870-18" data-blocks='[["BL_870.20",870,[1000,1741,748,127]]]'>And as to the fourth point, we expressly ruled on this point in <em>Sapp; </em>we are not convinced we erred therein.</p>
    <p id="b870-19" data-blocks='[["BL_870.21",870,[998,1922,749,87]]]'>Accordingly, we adhere to the ruling in the <em>Sapp </em>case.</p>

This, in our opinion, is unreasonably restrictive. As we stated in <em>Sapp, </em>expert witness fees “should be limited to time necessarily spent in attendance upon the Court for the purpose of testifying.” This includes, in our judgment, a reasonable time (a) traveling to and from the court house, (b) waiting in the court house for <a id="p839" href="#p839" data-label="839" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*839</a>the call to the witness stand, and (c) testifying.</p>

We find the $100. witness fee allowed by the Trial Judge fair and reasonable and clearly within the bounds of a sound judicial discretion.</p>
