    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[173,465,1124,497]]]'>Petitioner engaged in criminal conduct which occurred in two counties: Nye County and Lander County. On December 14, 1994, in Austin in Lander County, petitioner stole two vehicles, a blue Mercury Tracer and a Dodge Minivan. He also broke into a house and stole some tools. He then drove into Nye County in the Dodge, and ended up in a bar just over the county line. After Nye County sheriff’s deputies apprehended petitioner, handcuffed him and placed him in the sheriff’s patrol car, petitioner kicked his way out of the car, stole another car, a 1989 Mercury, and fled. He was apprehended after he crashed the 1989 Mercury into a patrol car.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[175,966,1127,443]]]'>Petitioner was charged in Nye County with grand larceny of the 1989 Mercury, possession of a stolen vehicle for the Dodge Minivan, assault with a deadly weapon for crashing the 1989 Mercury, burglary for entering the 1989 Mercury, escape for fleeing the custody of the Nye County Sheriff and possession of an instrument with burglarious intent for possessing the tools. Petitioner entered a plea of guilty in Nye County to one count of grand larceny and one count of escape. The other charges were dismissed. As an express provision of the plea, the state agreed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.7",665,[260,1439,1039,177]]]'>[T]he State will not pursue or file any other criminal charges based upon, or arising out of, the facts and circumstances upon which said pending charges are based, or the facts and circumstances upon which the complaint is founded.</blockquote>

Lander County also charged petitioner with being a habitual criminal.</p>

The district court <a id="p1484" href="#p1484" data-label="1484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1484</a>denied petitioner’s motion.

Russo, <a href="/f2d/801/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="801 F.2d 624" data-case-ids="10547663" data-case-paths="/f2d/801/0624-01">801 F.2d 624</a>, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). In the interests of clarity, we conclude that, in Nevada, the second county’s consent to be bound must be expressly stated as a term of the plea agreement.

As I see it, the District Attorney of Nye County had the power to charge and negotiate only the crimes that were committed in Nye County. Zebe pleaded guilty to escape, a crime that was committed in Nye County, and to grand larceny of a 1989 Mercury, a crime that was <a id="p1486" href="#p1486" data-label="1486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1486</a>subject to prosecution in either Nye or Lander County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The plea bargain negotiated by the Nye County District Attorney immunizes Zebe against criminal charges available to that District Attorney (that is to say, criminal charges arising in that officer’s venue) that are “based upon” or “arising out of” the “facts and circumstances upon which said pending charges are based.” All of the “pending charges” that are subject to the plea bargain necessarily relate to crimes committed in Nye County or, like the larceny charge, were subject to prosecution in “either county.”</p>

The agreement by the Nye County District Attorney can only relate to the “pending charges” in Nye County and to “facts and circumstances upon which the [Nye County] complaint is founded.” Thus, the Nye County District Attorney merely agreed not to pursue any of the charges that had been pending in Nye County (possession of a stolen vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, flight, and possession of burglary tools, all crimes committed within Nye County). This agreement is not binding on and has no effect on the Lander County District Attorney.
