The novel steps that appellant seeks to claim are that (1) this procedure be carried out in accordance with Sabin’s large-volume, rapid-passage technique and (2) that the attenuated virus be thereafter propagated in an artificial medium devoid of avian tissue. Thus, the questioned term “until the virus has become attenuated” does not occur at the exact point of novelty of appellant’s invention. Also,  since'the serial-passage procedure of attenuating NDV is well known, we see no reason why appellant’s claims should detail the procedure by which the determination is made.

The record does not show whether routine experimentation would indicate a suitable culture media.
