Many estates, as well of deceased persons, as of persons insolvent who have made general assignments, have been settled upon the footing of its correctness. A practice so long and so general, would, of itself, furnish strong grounds for a liberal construction; and could not now be disturbed without introducing a train of serious mischiefs. We think the practice was founded in the true exposition of the terms and intent of the act: but if it were susceptible of some doubt, so long an acquiescence in it would justify us in yielding to it as a safe and reasonable exposition.</blockquote>

The consumers stated in their petition for reconsideration that they were "satisfied that there is no net gain — in earnings or profits— flowing to the [utilities] from their imposition of the GRT surcharge factor.” It is undisputed, and this court has held, that a utility is entitled to pass on the economic burden of the GRT to its customers. <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v.
