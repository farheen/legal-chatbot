The Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court and held that absentee ballots delivered by third persons were valid under these circumstances.

In response, on October 22, 2003, the acting Chairman of the Board of Elections, the Honorable James McGregor of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, directed the Elections Division to refuse absentee ballots delivered by third parties. This policy was strictly enforced between October 22, 2003, and October 27, 2003.</p>

The decision in <em>DiPietrae </em>was powered by considerations regarding the Election Code’s allowance for disabled electors and the necessity to accommodate their voting rights under federal law. Those considerations are simply not present here, and concerns with preventing vote fraud properly prevail. Accordingly, <em>DiPietrae </em>does not apply, and we are not compelled to pretend that “shall” means “may” under Section 3146.6(a).</p>

The rebanee upon <em>Union Electric </em>to support some general theory of detrimental reliance is misplaced. As discussed <em>supra, Union Electric </em>involved a party who filed a late appeal in reliance upon a tax board’s improper extension of the statutory appeal deadbne. The trial court quashed the appeal as untimely and the Commonwealth Court affirmed. This Court reversed and held that an appeal <em>nunc, pro tunc </em>(literally, “now for then”) was appropriate because there was a breakdown in the court’s operations through a default of its officers. We noted in <em>Union Electric </em>that “[allowing an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>is a recognized exception to the general rule prohibiting the extension of an appeal deadline.” <em>Id. </em>at 584. <em>Union Electric, </em>thus, is a case involving a jurisprudential doctrine governing judicial fifing deadlines.</p>

The Board of Elections’ failure to follow clear substantive provisions of the Election Code does not constitute a breakdown in the court’s operations which a court has the power to remedy. Moreover, the position taken by the Board was one which was more likely to invite, rather than remedy, fraud. In addition, that position went to substantive matters — how to cast a reliable vote — and not to a mere procedural matter, such as a filing deadline. Finally, if we were to approve the Board’s contra-statutory actions here upon such “equitable” grounds, it would generate a far greater inequity: the uneven treatment of absentee votes throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

The Election Code plainly establishes the manner in which absentee ballots must be delivered to the Board of Elections. Section 2642(f) of the Election Code provides that Boards of Elections have limited authority to “make and issue such rules, regulations and instructions, not inconsistent with law....” 25 P.S. § 2642(f) (emphasis added).
