All of these claims arose from the conveyance of the family farm by Evelyn to Kenneth and Cheryl. The Fullers allege that the court erred by: (1) admitting improper testimony by Rich’s medical experts; (2) denying their request to present a rebuttal witness; (3) excluding certain testimony by the attorney who represented <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>them in the underlying conveyance; (4) exhibiting bias; (5) improperly instructing the jury; (6) permitting improper closing argument; and (7) undervaluing their contributions to the real estate.

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[193,747,754,943]]]'>In 1983 Evelyn, a widow and the mother of seven children, agreed to lease the family farm to Kenneth and Cheryl and to give them an option to purchase the property. The Fullers and Evelyn met with attorney Alan Nelson and described their agreement. Although he claimed to represent only the Fullers, Nelson met privately with Evelyn to satisfy himself that she was acting voluntarily. Thereafter Nelson prepared the lease and option agreement which the parties signed. Nelson took Evelyn’s acknowledgment. The agreement gave the Fullers the option to purchase the farm for $54,895.19 less their expenditures during the lease period for rent and real estate taxes. The option purchase price would be comprised of $20,000 in cash at closing less rent and taxes paid and the balance in 240 monthly payments of $250.</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[189,1718,754,1029]]]'>In December 1984 the Fullers exercised their option to purchase the property. Evelyn deeded the land to them and, instead of cash, they gave her a promissory note for $20,000. Evelyn died in 1989. After her death her other children discovered that Evelyn had conveyed the farm to the Fullers. In December 1990 the special administrator of Evelyn’s estate, Peter Rich, along with five of Evelyn’s other children, brought an action in the Probate Court against the Fullers seeking rescission of the deed. Evelyn’s oldest daughter, Gail Cox, was the only child who did not join the suit. The action was removed to the Superior Court and, as later amended, the complaint contained equitable counts for common law rescission and undue influence, and legal counts of fraud and interference with an expectancy. The parties and the court agreed that the legal counts would be tried to a jury and the equitable counts would be tried at the same time to the court.</p>
    <p id="b129-9" data-blocks='[["BL_129.7",129,[994,254,750,419]]]'>The court dismissed the fraud count. The jury found that the defendants had exercised undue influence on Evelyn. The court entered a judgment on the rescission and undue influence counts in favor of the plaintiffs and found that the Fullers were equitably entitled to a payment of $34,454.21 for payments and improvements that they made to the property. The Fullers appeal.</p>

The conference was not recorded and there is no docket entry referring to it. At trial, psychiatrists who had treated Evelyn testified that she had a history of mental illness and had difficulty thinking. The Fullers moved to strike the testimony, arguing that it went beyond the limits of the court’s earlier ruling. The court denied the motion.</p>

As a result, we are left without a basis for deciding whether the testimony was beyond the scope of the earlier ruling. Moreover, the Fullers do not argue that this testimony is otherwise inadmissible. We, therefore, cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted the experts to testify about Evelyn’s ability to function mentally.</p>

Undue influence is not an intentional tort as the Fullers contend, but rather a set of circumstances that gives rise to the equitable remedy of rescission. <em>See <a href="/a2d/559/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="559 A.2d 354" data-case-ids="7885625" data-case-paths="/a2d/559/0354-01">id.</a> </em>ch. 7, Topic 2, introductory note at 474. The court’s instruction in this case was not inconsistent with the doctrine of undue influence. In essence the instruction says that a person must intend to persuade, but does not necessarily have to know that this persuasion will seriously impair the other person’s free and competent exercise of judgment.</p>
    <p id="b132-13" data-blocks='[["BL_132.13",132,[1046,461,751,889]]]'>The Fullers also contend that the court erred when, in response to a jury request to reread the instruction on undue influence, it refused to reread the instruction in its entirety but gave only an abbreviated version of the earlier instruction along with examples that they claim were “one-sided.” As long as the instructions are “substantially correct and the legal situation is made clear to the jury” the decision not to amplify an instruction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>Pelkey v. Canadian Pac., Ltd., </em><a href="/a2d/586/1248-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="586 A.2d 1248" data-case-ids="7377277" data-case-paths="/a2d/586/1248-01">586 A.2d 1248</a>, 1251 (Me.1991). At the trial the Fullers conceded that the original charge was “very satisfactory” and even now they do not challenge the accuracy of the supplemental instruction. We find no abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to give an abbreviated but accurate instruction.</p>

      <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>The Fullers argue that two other statements constitute the expression of personal opinion. First, in commenting on the testimony of Nelson, Rich’s attorney stated:</p>

    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[172,827,752,650]]]'>Second, in comparing the Fullers’ testimony to other evidence, Rich’s attorney stated: “Ladies and gentlemen, it may be that I have got too cynical over the years I am practicing law but I candidly have to say to you those pieces don’t go together in my mind.” An attorney may not assert a personal opinion as to the credibility of a witness. M.Bar R. 3.7(e)(2)(v). “Ill-chosen words” about witnesses, however, do not necessarily constitute obvious error. <em>See State v.
