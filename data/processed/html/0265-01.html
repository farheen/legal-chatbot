The object of the legislation was to protect children of divorced parents from being unjustly deprived of opportunities they would otherwise have had if their parents had not divorced. The statute was promulgated to ensure that children of divorced families are not deprived of educational opportunities solely because their families are no longer intact. The re-suit is a heightened judicial involvement in the financial and personal lives of divorced families with children that is not necessary with intact families with children. The New Hampshire Supreme Court concluded that because of the unique problems of divorced families, the legislature could rationally conclude that absent judicial involvement, children of divorced families may be less likely than children of intact families to receive post-secondary educational support from both parents.</p>

It operates on the assumption that divorce necessarily involves a disadvantage to the children of broken families, and is intended to assure that children who are thus disadvantaged by the divorce or separation of their parents are not deprived of the opportunity to acquire post secondary school education. In effect, it attempts to maintain the children of divorce in the same position they would have been in had their parents’ marriage remained intact. The Act is not intended to, nor does it, place a premium on the rights of children of divorce while devaluing the same rights for children from intact marriage. It merely recognizes that, in general, divorce has a deleterious effect upon children, which should, insofar as is possible, be redressed. Thus while constitutional principles permit this intended result, a “difference in fact or opinion” recognized by the Legislature as within its purview, the Majority has declared that, at least for college age children, the distinction between the children of broken families and those of intact families simply does not exist.</p>

The court has thus already become involved to the extent of entering an order, or there exists another legal mechanism, e.g., separation agreement, through which enforcement can be accomplished and contribution monitored.

The size of the state university system, the multiplicity of community colleges and other educational programs designed to provide low cost post-secondary training, all attest to the state’s involvement with the goal of bettering the information and functioning level of the attendees. Clearly the Majority accepts this focus, hence its query as to whether the statute would be acceptable were it only altered to require all parents to contribute to the post-secondary educational expenses of their children. However, as noted above, this kind of government mandated action is <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>constitutionally untenable when applied to intact families.</p>

It is, after all, these parents at whom Act 62 is aimed. Divorce modifies parental behavior in ways which cannot always be anticipated. To ignore the reality of these differences, and the impact necessarily produced upon the children is shortsighted, as the educational achievements of the next generations are critical to the success of this country in an increasingly competitive world.</p>
    <p id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[224,1184,755,1279]]]'>The law need not, and should not, change direction to comport with every change in the prevailing social winds. Nor is it designed to redress every psychological and emotional ill which trails in the wake of divorce. However, principles of justice require an unwavering commitment to the protection of the weakest members of our society, our children. Refusal to recognize their weakness breaches the social compact, and violates the basic principles of fairness the law is intended to uphold. Given the consequences of divorce, to deprive children of broken marriages of the economic support which they would normally receive from nuclear families is to deny them equal protection. As the court in <em>Childers, supra, </em>noted, the imposition of a burden of support does establish a classification with discriminatory obligations. However, rather than an arbitrary, unreasonable or unjust classification, there is instead a collection of special powers in equity that the courts, regardless of legislation, have long used to protect the children of broken homes. <em>Id. </em>at 604, <a href="/citations/?q=575%20P.2d%20201" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="575 P.2d 201">575 P.2d at 208</a>.

What these assumptions imply is that regardless of the need involved, food, clothing and medical care, or higher education, children qua children are always on an equal footing since they are always in need of parental financial support. Thus, following the Majority's logic, any legislation which distinguishes between children on the basis of their parents’ marital status is constitutionally suspect, e.g., any law requiring support from parents no longer living in an intact marriage, or never having been in such a marriage.</p>
