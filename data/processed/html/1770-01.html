In the alternative Star requested suspension of the opposition pending the filing of a petition by it to cancel the registration of OCEAN-STAE and requested a consolidation with the opposition to OCEAN ⅛ STAE. The Patent Office denied the motion to strike, noting that the OCEANSTAE registration “is relevant to the question of possible damage to the opposer [appellant],” and gave appellant a limited time within which to file a petition for cancellation “failing which, the opposition will be dismissed.” The petition was timely filed and Mido pleaded the affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel in answer to the cancellation petition.

The witness testified further that his company received shipments of watches marked “OCEANSTAR” beginning in 1944, with shipments being of “vast quantities” starting in 1959. This witness gave no actual figures as to shipments or sales of watches under the mark “OCEANSTAR” excepting that since 1959 the shipments of such watches have “run into thousands.” “OCEANSTAR’’ watches have been advertised during the years 1959 and 1960 and this advertising has been directed to the trade and the public through the means of national magazine advertising, newspaper advertising, counter cards, folders and broad sides. In this regard, “OCEANSTAR” watches have been solely featured or featured in conjunction with other “MIDO” watches. It is estimated that advertising costs in 1959 and 1960 approximated one hundred and seventy thousand dollars and two hundred thousand dollars respectively.</blockquote>

We have two proceedings before us with different marks and issues of such a nature that they cannot be easily lumped together. Considered in their entirety there are several significant differences between appellee’s two marks, primarily the one word mark as opposed to a composite two-word mark which flanks a design representation of a star. Such changes might shift the dominant theme of the mark from “ocean” to “star.” We think that the marks of appellee, while similar in the verbal portion, are not the same mark for the <em>legal </em>purposes here and must be considered separately with respect to a comparison with the marks of appellant.</p>
    <p id="b1098-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1098.6",1098,[332,1221,1327,447]]]'>It is so fundamental that a party not presenting testimony is restricted to his filing date that no authority need be cited. Thus we may consider only appellant’s earliest two marks as against the OCEANSTAR mark of appellee in the cancellation. From what we have said concerning the difference between appellee’s two marks it follows that we must consider all of appellant’s marks in connection with the opposition, since all are prior to the date of OCE A NASTAR. Further, as appellant points out, there can be no issue of laches with regard to the mark OCEANA-STAR.</p>

We feel there are sufficient differences between the mark sought to be registered and the marks of appellant that, when used on the identical goods, there is no likelihood of confusion. Although the separation into two words OCEAN and STAR with an addition of a design representing a star serves somewhat to emphasize that design, there is a significant difference between it and the five-point star in appellant’s mark. We think that, considered in their entireties, the marks are not so similar as to create an impression in the minds of the purchasers which would be likely to cause them to consider that the goods emanated from the same source.</p>
