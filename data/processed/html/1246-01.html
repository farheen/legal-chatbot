Three years later, Welch brought a personal injury action in Superior Court against Mosley and his employer, Capital Cab Cooperative Association, Inc. At the time, Mosley had available up to $25,000 in motor vehicle insurance coverage from Capital Casualty Insurance Company, Inc. (“CCIC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Cab.</p>
    <p id="b1295-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1295.16",1295,[918,468,755,767]]]'>Capital Cab successfully moved for summary judgment and was dismissed from the action in mid-1998. Not long thereafter, in a separate proceeding, the court declared CCIC insolvent and ordered that it be liquidated. As a result, Welch’s action against Mosley was stayed for six months to permit the District of Columbia Insurance Guaranty Association (“DCI-GA”) to assume CCIC’s defense and other obligations in accordance with the Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act of 1993 (“the IGA Act”), now codified as D.C.Code §§ 31-5501 to 31-5515 (2001).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The jury found Mosley liable and awarded Welch $75,000 in damages. Mosley then filed a post-trial motion for partial relief from the judgment. Mosley argued that because the DCIGA had replaced CCIC as his insurer, the IGA Act applied to Welch’s claim and required Welch to exhaust whatever rights he had to uninsured motorist (“UM”) coverage under his own motor vehicle insurance policy as a precondition to enforcing his judgment against Mosley.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Mosley asked the court to stay Welch’s collection efforts against him “on any sum the equivalent amount of which is found to be available in an alternative source of insurance, presumably, the uninsured motorists provision of plaintiffs automobile insurance policy.” Welch opposed Mosley’s motion <a id="p1248" href="#p1248" data-label="1248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1248</a>on various grounds. Welch acknowledged-that he had his own motor vehicle insurance policy in 1994, when Mosley injured him. Among other things, however, Welch argued that by 1998, when CCIC became insolvent, it would have been too late for him to make a claim under his 1994 policy. Welch further claimed that he no longer could identify the insurance carrier that had issued that policy. Most important, Welch argued that the Act did not afford Mosley any rights against him and did not oblige Welch to exhaust his own insurance coverage before he could enforce his judgment by levying on Mosley’s assets.</p>
    <p id="b1296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1296.5",1296,[188,1077,761,872]]]'>No stay was in effect while Mosley’s post-trial motion was pending. During that time, Welch obtained writs of <em>fieri facias </em>on Mosley’s real and personal property and writs of attachment against his wages and savings; and the court entered judgment of condemnation for Welch against $ 27,488.08 in Mosley’s bank account. In August 2000, the trial court denied Mosley’s post-trial motion on the ground that it was “not supported by the evidentiary record of the case.” Thereafter, counsel have informed us, Welch collected the balance of his judgment from Mosley’s assets while DCIGA honored CCIC’s coverage obligation to Mosley and paid him $25,000.</p>

The DCIGA would have been entitled to a credit for any UM payments that Welch received. Alternatively, even after it paid Mosley, the DCIGA perhaps might have pursued reimbursement by invoking its rights under D.C.Code § 31-5509(a). But the DCI-GA has not asserted its statutory rights to exhaustion and set-off in any manner.</p>
    <p id="b1297-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1297.11",1297,[919,1076,754,622]]]'>Mosley nonetheless argues that D.C.Code § 31-5509(a) gives policy holders of insolvent insurers the same rights it gives the DCIGA to require prior exhaustion and set-off.

The purpose of D.C.Code § 31-5509(a) is to avoid duplicate insurance recoveries and protect the funds of the DCIGA, not to reduce the liability of <a id="p1250" href="#p1250" data-label="1250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1250</a>insureds or provide them with more asset protection than if their insurers had not become insolvent. When he received the payment from the DCIGA, Mosley received all the protection that the IGA Act was supposed to provide. If, in addition to the DCIGA’s payment, Mosley were to receive a credit in the amount of Welch’s available UM insurance, Mosley would be better off than if CCIC had remained solvent. He would be the beneficiary of a windfall. That is not what the IGA Act was meant to accomplish. The statute does not leave room for doubt on this point. The last sentence of D.C.Code § 31-5509(a) states that “[a]ny amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such an insurance policy.” This sentence refers only to amounts payable by the DCIGA, because only the DCIGA has the obligation under “this chapter” to pay a “covered claim.” Only the DCIGA itself, we conclude, has the right provided by D.C.Code § 31-5509(a) to require a claimant to exhaust other insurance coverage and to reduce its own exposure to the extent of such other coverage. The DCIGA has not asserted that right in this case. The trial court therefore did not err in denying Mosley’s post-trial motion, and we affirm the judgment on appeal.</p>
