On the evening of May 28, 2008, Henry Moore, appellant’s ex-boyfriend and the father of her three year old daughter, arrived at the home of appellant’s sister to drop off their daughter. As Moore was returning to his car, appellant approached him and called him a “b****,” kicked his car, and then began to hit him with a bookbag and her hand. Moore called 911 from his cell phone during the assault.</p>
    <p id="b1008-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.16",1008,[972,884,757,1004]]]'>Officer Michelle Riddlehoover arrived on the scene within two to three minutes after the 911 call and found Moore standing outside of his car, “pacing back and forth” and “kind of shaking a little bit.” She noticed that “he had a small red ... mark on his left temple.” When Officer Riddle-hoover inquired about what happened, Moore responded “fast” and in an “elevated” voice, appearing “frustrated ... [and] upset and agitated,” that appellant had followed him after he dropped off their daughter, kicked his car, “hit him in the head,” and then “sped off.” At trial, Moore testified that, despite his efforts to block the assault, appellant “got a couple of good hits on [his] face and [his] temple.” Later that night, emergency room personnel prescribed him pain medication for “a closed head injury.”</p>

Officer Riddleho-over arrived on the scene two to three minutes after the 911 call was made and she spoke with Moore immediately upon arrival. ■ Officer Riddlehoover’s testimony about Moore’s mental and physical state upon her arrival makes clear that he was still in “a state of nervous excitement” due to the assault. <em><a href="/a2d/980/1174-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="980 A.2d 1174" data-case-ids="7297208" data-case-paths="/a2d/980/1174-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/980/1174-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="980 A.2d 1174" data-case-ids="7297208" data-case-paths="/a2d/980/1174-01">at 1185</a>.

The legislative history for § 16-712(a) reveals that there was strong support for this community service provision. <em>See </em>D.C. Council, Report on Bill 4-120 at 2 (Nov. 10, 1982). Notably, § 16-712 (a) did not authorize the imposition of community service for the first time in this jurisdiction. Rather the law provided guidance to the Superior Court judges on how to impose community service in addition to other penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Section 16-712(b) specified, for the first time, that “the court shall take into consideration the physical and mental health of the defendant, his or her age, education, employment and vocational training, family circumstances, financial condition, and any other factors as shall be appropriate,” and § 16-712(c) granted the defendant the right to request a hearing on "any matter related to the plan of community service.”</p>
