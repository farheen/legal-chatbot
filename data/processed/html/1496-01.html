Mr. Barrett was not feeling well and went to respondent St. Rose de Lima Hospital (Hospital). There he was seen by respondent Dr. George Baird who, after performing several tests and prescribing treatments for Mr. Barrett, released Mr. Barrett from the hospital. That night, Mr. Barrett became delirious. He was rushed to the hospital and placed on a respirator, but the hospital did not have sufficient facilities to continue treating Mr. Barrett.

Barrett claimed that Mr. Barrett’s death was the result of the combined effects of (1) the negligent failure of Dr. Baird, as an agent of the Hospital, to admit Mr. Barrett to the Hospital on January 26, 1989, when, she claims, there was clear medical evidence that his chicken pox had disseminated and that he was developing varicella pneumonia and secondary infections due to the virus, and (2) Drs. Brown and Bernstein’s negligent failure to diagnose and correct a massive bleed into Mr. Barrett’s left pleural space, and Dr. Bernstein’s negligent dialyzing of Mr. Barrett when he was hemodynamically unstable, due to the bleed.</p>

Both motions were denied. Barrett renews her denied challenges on appeal. Specifically, Barrett claims the screening panel statute is unconstitutional because it violates the right to a jury trial, equal protection, separation of powers, and due process. Furthermore, she claims that the district court abused its discretion in not granting her a new trial because opposing counsel engaged in discovery misconduct, made a remark about the high cost of health care, made an improper “golden rule” argument, showed the jury a picture of one of counsel’s family, conducted a scientific demonstration during opening statement without laying foundation and then stated in closing argument that Barrett failed to refute the experiment, and, finally, improperly referred to the screening panel as an expert witness.

She claims that the statute violates separation of powers by (1) creating a court (i.e., the screening panel), not authorized by the constitution, whose decisions are immune from collateral attack or review by the litigant or the constitutionally authorized courts, and (2) stripping the district courts of their authority to conduct trials by not allowing them to determine the competency and admissibility of evidence, instruct the jury, and award attorney fees in their discretion. We conclude that these arguments lack merit for the same reasons we outlined in the analysis of the jury trial issue.</p>
