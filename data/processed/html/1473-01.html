The agreement stated that Gomes denied his guilt but entered his plea pursuant to <em>Alford </em>and agreed that the State could establish at trial that he had forced the daughter of the woman he lived with<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to <a id="p1476" href="#p1476" data-label="1476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1476</a>engage in multiple sexual acts with him since she was twelve.

The district court asked Gomes, “Do you understand the charge against you?” He answered, “Yes.” The court asked, “What is your plea to that charge?” He answered, “Nolo contendere.” Defense counsel, Henry R. Gordon, told the court that “we are agreeable to the terms of the Plea Bargain Agreement; however, I want to make sure one thing is clear on the record: He is pleading nolo contendere with the ramifications for civil purposes because they’re civil implications involved in this case.”</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[216,843,1122,400]]]'>The prosecutor then said, “Your Honor, the correct language is he is entering a no contest plea. The Court may treat that and accept that as a guilty plea pursuant to the Alford decision.” Defense counsel said again that Gomes’ plea was nolo contendere even though the written agreement described the plea as guilty. He said that “there might be some inconsistencies” with the plea agreement. The prosecutor responded: “There is no inconsistency. The Court and the law provides that this is treated as a guilty plea.”</p>

The court asked Gomes if he knew the possible penalty he faced, and Gomes said, “five to life.” Gomes answered yes when asked if he had discussed the agreement with his attorney. When the court asked Gomes if he had read it, Gomes’ counsel spoke: “In fact, Your Honor, may I make the record that he’s discussed it not only with me on at least three prior occasions but with two additional attorneys.” (Gomes was not in custody while his lawyer negotiated the plea agreement with prosecutors.) When asked if he had questions of the court regarding the agreement, Gomes said no. The court then told Gomes that he was waiving certain constitutional rights by entering his plea: the right to a trial where the State would have to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to confront witnesses against him, the right to subpoena his own witnesses, the right to either testify or not, the right to an attorney, and the right to appeal.

But that error was of no consequence since nothing in the record indicates that the district court in the civil action against Gomes considered his plea in the criminal case to have been a guilty plea and used that plea as the basis for the civil judgment against him.

In accepting an <em>Alford </em>plea or plea of nolo contendere, a district court must determine not only that there is a factual basis for the plea but “must further inquire into and seek to resolve the conflict between the waiver of trial and the claim of innocence.” Tiger v.

Nothing in the record indicates that the victim was not ready and able to so testify. A sexual assault victim’s uncorroborated testimony is sufficient evidence to convict. Hutchins v.

The court also had a sufficient basis to resolve the conflict between the nolo contendere plea and the claim of innocence: defense counsel told the court that Gomes preferred to plead guilty to one count rather than risk going to trial and being convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault.</p>
    <p id="b663-8" data-blocks='[["BL_663.7",663,[165,1587,1124,268]]]'>However, Gomes did not make factual statements to the court which constituted an admission. The issue then is whether Gomes understood the charge against him. When the district court asked him that question at his arraignment, he answered yes. And the written plea agreement which Gomes signed sets forth the statutory definition of sexual assault.</p>
    <p id="b663-9" data-blocks='[["BL_663.8",663,[166,1862,1126,489]]]'>This court held that a guilty plea was valid where the defendant signed a plea bargain memorandum that stated the elements of the charged offense, the district court read the crime as charged in the information to the defendant and asked him if he understood the charge, and the defendant said he did.
