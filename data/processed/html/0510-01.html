    <p id="A_z" data-blocks='[["BL_545.23",545,[987,1452,757,481]]]'>¶ 2 Leonard Polk owns and operates a junkyard and automobile graveyard in the Town of Lubec. In 1998, Polk sought a renewal of his annual permit from the Town’s Board of Selectmen. The Code Enforcement Officer recommended against the renewal because he believed that Polk had failed to comply with conditions of a prior permit. Polk sought a hearing before the Board of Selectmen.</p>
    <p id="AuL" data-blocks='[["BL_545.24",545,[988,1970,758,481]],["BL_546.1",546,[197,225,750,87]]]'>¶ 3 At the hearing, Polk argued that the Board was only authorized to determine whether his fence sufficiently screened the junkyard from public view, relying on 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3755(1) (1996), which authorizes municipalities to issue junkyard permits so long as the yard is “entirely screened to ordinary view from the highway.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">

      </a>
      <em> </em>The Board, on the other hand, understood that it was also authorized to <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>review Polk’s compliance with the conditions of his previous permit.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[194,335,752,679]]]'>¶ 4 The Board reviewed fourteen photographs of Polk’s property. Twelve photographs depicted various areas <em>within </em>the yard and two photographs depicted the screening <em>around </em>the yard. When asked to identify the areas of the Town’s concern, the Town Administrator told Polk that the “screening was not an issue to me. Your screening has fallen under what the definition of screening is. You could have a white picket fence there, but what is going on inside that white picket fence, if it is in compliance, is the question, and it was not in compliance.”</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[190,1037,754,834]]]'>¶ 5 When asked directly whether the fence was in compliance, the Town Administrator responded: ‘Tour fence was, but what' was going on inside that fence was not.” Polk protested to the Board that the only issue before the Board was the screening, “not what is inside.” The Board Chairman responded: “That’s where we have to differ.” The Board went on to discuss six “violations” within Polk’s yard, including: (1) antifreeze and oil stored without berms; (2) vehicles being stored for other parties; (3) torque converters leaking oil; (4) aerosol cans in burn piles; (5) vinyl siding in burn piles; and (6) asphalt shingles lying on the ground. The Board ultimately denied Polk’s application.</p>
    <p id="b546-6" data-blocks='[["BL_546.6",546,[186,1893,755,529]]]'>¶ 6 Polk filed an appeal in the Superior Court, challenging the denial pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 80B. In addition, Polk included several independent claims pursuant to Rule 80B(i). By the time the case came before the court, however, Polk had been issued a permit for the year 1999. The court, therefore, dismissed the Rule 80B claim as moot. Polk did not challenge the court’s conclusion nor did he appeal from that determination.</p>

Polk argued in his opposition to the Town’s motion for summary judgment that, by imposing additional conditions on his application, the Board had violated his due process rights. The court concluded that Polk had not properly alleged a violation of due process in his complaint, but nevertheless concluded that, even if Polk had properly pled a due process claim, a summary judgment was appropriate because Polk failed to establish facts in the record to support a due •process claim. The court also granted the Town’s motion for summary judgment related to Polk’s equal protection and tort claims. Polk then filed this appeal.</p>

Section 3755 authorizes municipalities to issue junkyard permits, so long as the yard is “entirely screened to ordinary view from the highway.” 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3755(1)(A). Although no other permit requirements are established by statute, municipalities are free to “enact ordinances with respect to automobile graveyards ... and junkyards that concern any other standards that the municipality determines* reasonable.” 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3755(5). The Town did not enact any additional regulations.</p>

The Board did not issue findings or otherwise explain its denial. Because Polk’s Rule 80B appeal was dismissed as moot, there has never been an adjudication of his claim that the Board acted beyond its authority. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume that Polk has presented material facts in support of his claim that the Board based its denial <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>on his failure to comply with the previous conditions, not on the inadequacy of his screening.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
