Doctor Wilson specifically rejected use of a seasonal differential for several reasons, including the relatively small winter-summer peak differential, the scheduled maintenance problem, and Central Maine Power’s responsibilities as part of NE-POOL. In abbreviated form his testimony was that:</p>

Similarly, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act requires state regulatory commissions to <em>“consider” </em>such standards as seasonal rates, and determine <em>“whether or not it is appropriate to implement such </em>[a] <em>standard . . </em>.” § 111(a); <em>See also H.

The Act, as the Council concedes, was not signed into law until nearly a month after the Commission’s Decree in this case, and allows commissions three years to consider the implementation of the <em>“standards” </em>set forth therein. § 111(b). The question, the Council says in its reply brief, is not whether the Commission has violated any specific directive of PURPA, but whether it violated its policy in declining to adopt seasonal rates. On the basis of this record, we cannot find such a violation. The Commission made its decision after hearing conflicting evidence as to the propriety of seasonal rates. In choosing the more conservative path of declining to adopt seasonal rates without further assurances of precision in tracking actual costs, it was faithful to its obligation to make no findings without substantial evidence.</p>

Stockton Springs was characterized as a <em>“future/alternative site for steam generation” </em>whose earliest possible operational date was in the late 1980’s. Richmond was considered a possible site for a nuclear plant. The earliest date for putting this land into service was said to be 1991, although Central Maine Power admitting that target was becoming less realistic. The Commission concluded it would not <em>“burden ratepayers for an indefinite period with paying a return on Company assets which confer no immediate benefit on and provide no guarantee of future benefit to Central Maine’s ratepayers. ”</em>

        <em>To the extent that the actual customer cost exceeds the customer charge, the difference has apparently been recovered in the first few blocks of the declining block rate.

The only remaining justification, the Commission concluded, would be that the energy charge included some customer costs. Finding it inappropriate, as noted in n. 56, <em>supra, </em>to allow intra-class subsidization of customer costs, the Commission chose to assess a higher <em>"up front” </em>customer charge in order to move to a flat-rate energy charge. No party to this appeal contests the Commission’s decision to do away with the declining block structure.</p>

(App. 280) His resulting cost would be 2.386‡ per Kwh. A typical residential ratepayer using 600 Kwh that same month would have a total bill of (600 X 2.196$ plus $5.70) $18.88 or 3.146 per Kwh.

In this particular instance, under the new rates, the discrimination would be reduced but remain substantial; at very low use levels, the discrimination obviously will have increased inasmuch as the $5.70 charge is much higher than the $3.40 charge for the first 25 Kwh.</em>
