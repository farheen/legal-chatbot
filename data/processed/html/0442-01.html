On February 22, 1973, the PLRB certified APSCUF as the exclusive representative of a unit of professional employees who had faculty status and were engaged in the administrative operation of SSHE schools (hereinafter referred to as the “APSCUF administrative unit”). Subsequent to those certifications, the PLRB issued a final order on October 26, 1976, in which the PLRB excluded administrators without faculty status from the previously certified APSCUF administrative unit.

After hearings, the hearing examiner issued a proposed order of dismissal in which he concluded that the director of multi-cultural affairs should not be included in the APSCUF teaching unit because an examination of the certification history revealed that faculty status was the determining factor in excluding employees from the APSCUF teaching unit. The record revealed that the director of multi-affairs did not have faculty status.

While it has already been determined, contrary to the assertion of APSCUF, that faculty status is the bright line dividing the SCUPA administrative unit and the AP-SCUF administrative unit, faculty status is not an absolute prerequisite to the inclusion in APSCUF teaching unit. APSCUF’s teaching unit also includes employes without faculty status who provide direct classroom support, i.e., librarians and also individuals who oversee the academic curriculum and other academic matters relating to the teaching faculty, i.e., department chairmen. Accordingly, an additional criterion for inclusion in the [APSCUF] unit is the delivery of academic support services such as those provided by the librarians and department chairmen. Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the hearing examiner for further hearing to determine whether or not the position at issue is primarily involved in either teaching or provision of academic support services such as those provided by librarians or department chairmen so as to justify APSCUF’s contention that the position is appropriately included in the APSCUF teaching unit.</blockquote>

Herein, two petitions for unit clarification were filed on September 3, 1997 and December 8, 1997 by APSCUF and SCUPA, respectively. Both APSCUF and SCUPA sought to include approximately twelve athletic trainers without faculty status into their bargaining units of professional employees.

The PLRB sustained the exceptions in part and vacated the hearing examiner’s proposed order. The PLRB sustained APSCUF’s exception to the hearing examiner’s proposed order that the duties of the non-represented athletic trainers without faculty status were different from those of athletic trainers currently within the APSCUF teaching unit and the hearing examiner’s reliance on <em>Mansfield. </em>APSCUF argued that many of the thirty athletic trainers currently in their unit perform exactly the same duties as the twelve unrepresented athletic trainers. The PLRB pointed out that in <em>Mansfield, </em>the similarities between the job duties of the petitioned for position and the positions previously included in the unit were not determinative, because the unit clarification was pursuant to a stipulation of the parties and the facts of those particular positions included in the APSCUF unit were not specifically examined by the PLRB. However, the PLRB stated that in this case it was presented <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>with an extensive record detailing the similarities between the represented and unrepresented athletic trainers. The PLRB stated that while there was evidence in the record of some differences in job duties/descriptions, the PLRB was satisfied that the non-faculty athletic trainers employed by the SSHE performed generally the same functions as the faculty athletic trainers included in the unit.- The PLRB stated further that the record reflected the overwhelming similarities between the two classifications of athletic trainers.</p>

The PLRB stated that in addition to the <em>Mansfield </em>analysis, a traditional community of interest analysis is required to determine into which unit the non-faculty athletic trainers should be certified. The PLRB recognized that in determining whether an identifiable community of interest exists, the PLRB considers several factors including common or similar work duties, hours of employment, rates of pay, responsibilities, interest or interchange, fringe benefits, bargaining objectives, manner of hiring and supervision. The PLRB pointed out that an identifiable community of interest may exist despite some difference in those areas.</p>

The PLItB stated that the record was replete with examples of common or similar work duties among the faculty athletic trainers represented by APSCUF and the unrepresented non-faculty athletic trainers. The PLRB also stated that no meaningful distinction could be drawn to separate the two groups of athletic trainers in terms of teaching responsibilities, because there were examples in the record of faculty trainers that do not teach and non-faculty trainers that do teach. The PLRB also found persuasive the fact that AP-SCUF is already bargaining for approximately thirty-five athletic trainers and that SCUPA does not represent athletic trainers. The PLRB further determined that a community of interest existed between the two groups of athletic trainers concerning their hours of employment.

However, this remand order does not abrogate the mandate found in Section 604 of the PERA that public employees must have an identifiable community of interest and that the PLRB should look to several factors when making this determination. <em>See Fraternal Order of Police. </em>Moreover, as pointed out by the PLRB in its decision in this case, in <em>Mansfield, </em>the similarities between the job duties of the petitioned for position and the positions previously included in the unit were not determinative, because the unit clarification was pursuant to a stipulation of the parties and the facts of those particular positions included in the APSCUF unit were not specifically examined by the PLRB.
