The District Court judge sustained the appeals of the group to which he referred as “the petitioners,” who were claimants who had received adverse rulings from the board. He did not specifically discuss the cases in which the department appealed from the board’s decisions allowing benefits to certain claimants. Hence, it is unclear whether he intended to sustain the appeals of the department as well. Given our result below, however, his apparent oversight does not affect the substance of our decision or our reasoning. The board had determined that the claimants who should receive benefits were not subject to the disqualification set forth in § 28-44-68. The District Court judge apparently concluded that all claimants whose benefits had been denied by the board were not subject to the statute because of a different reason, specifically his reading of the statute and the application of the preposition “in.”</p>

The effect of his decision was to allow benefits to the claimants whose claims had been denied because he had determined that the disqualifying statute upon which the denial of benefits had been premised did not apply to them. The District Court judge did not address the other issues that petitioners raised because he found the applicability of the statute to be dispositive.</p>

The board asserts that the District Court judge based his decision on the word “in” as it appears in § 28-44-68(4). It claims that the judge erred by interpreting the term “educational institution” to signify the physical structure of a building rather than an organization. The board also contends that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term “institution” as used in § 28-44-68(4) dictates that bus drivers and monitors be included within the scope of that statute. It argues that even if the language of § <em>28-44r-</em>68(4) were ambiguous, the Legislature clearly intended school-bus drivers, monitors, and other public school employees to be exempt from unemployment benefits during summer and school vacations.

In its brief the department contends, among other things, that the plain language of subsections (2) and (3) of § 28-44-68 clearly prohibits the receipt of benefits by all the department’s employees because they sought benefits during customary vacation periods when they had a reasonable assurance of continued employment as drivers, aides, and monitors before the school recesses commenced. The department argues that the relevant issues are whether department employees performed services in a noninstructional capacity for an educational institution immediately before the recesses in question and whether there was a reasonable assurance that they would perform such services subsequent to the recesses. The department contends that the claimants concede that they meet those criteria and that all of them are disqualified from collecting benefits. The department maintains that the plain language of subsection (4) of the statute, as well as the legislative history of its federal counterpart, clearly indicates that the subsection does not apply to school personnel who work directly for an educational institution; rather, it applies only "to agency employees who perform services for educational institutions. It further argues that if the employees are permitted to collect unemployment benefits in these circumstances, the policy underlying the unemployment-compensation scheme would be frustrated.</p>

They contend that “[t]he Westerly school bus service would certainly qualify as an ‘educational service agency as defined in [§ ] 28-44458(4).” They also argue that the record establishes that the school-bus system operates on a year-round basis.

We have interpreted these subsections before without reference to subsection (4). <em>See Kachanis, </em><a href="/a2d/638/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="638 A.2d 553" data-case-ids="7365103" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0553-01">638 A.2d at 556-58</a> (applying § 28-44-68(2)(A) to school-lunch workers); <em>Baker, </em><a href="/a2d/637/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="637 A.2d 360" data-case-ids="7355221" data-case-paths="/a2d/637/0360-01">637 A.2d at 363-64</a> (applying § 28-44-68(1) to school teachers and stating that the entire statute bars the payment of benefits to school employees who are out of work only for holiday and summer recesses); <em>Woonsocket School Committee v.

    <p id="b288-7" data-blocks='[["BL_288.7",288,[1016,335,753,1184]]]'>In our opinion the plain language of the statute signifies that subsection (4) applies only to employees who performed such services “in an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency.” Thus, § 28-44-68 applies to three types of employees: instructional, research, and administrative employees as described in subsection (1); employees who perform “services in any other capacity for an educational institution (including elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education),” as described in subsection (2); and individuals who perform services as described in subsections (1) or (2) in an educational institution while employed by an educational service agency, as provided in subsection (4). The legislative history relating to the analogous provision of federal law persuades us further that employees of educational service agencies constitute a separate category. We also think that claimants in this case do not fit into that category since we determine that the department is not an educational service agency.</p>
    <p id="b288-8" data-blocks='[["BL_288.8",288,[1013,1542,754,802]]]'>Additionally, even if we concluded that subsection (4) of § 28-44-68 did apply to claimants, we think that the District Court judge engaged in a sort of prepositional-phrase formalism that ignores the plain meaning and purpose of that subsection. It would strain logic to interpret subsection (4) as premising the denial or allowance of benefits on whether the employees performed services physically inside an educational institution or outside. This could also lead to absurd results. It is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that “this court will not attribute to the Legislature an intent to enact laws that lead to absurd or unreasonable results.” <em>State v.

    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[154,707,755,1462]]]'>We now briefly discuss the few claimants from whom the board seeks restitution of partial benefits and waiting-period credit paid to them. The claimants argue that those who actually worked during vacation periods are entitled to partial unemployment benefits for weeks in which they worked fewer than their scheduled hours. They allege that the denial of partial benefits is a misapplication of § 28-44-68, and they cite § 28-44-7 to support their claim. That section provides for partial benefits to be paid to “an individual partially unemployed and eligible in any week.” The claimants underscored “partially unemployed” but seem to have ignored the eligibility requirement. We conclude that § 28-44-68 renders these claimants ineligible to collect benefits between terms and vacation periods in the circumstances set forth in that statute. Therefore, § 28-44-7 does not apply to them relative to those periods. Additionally, when reading § 28-44-68(2)(A), the <em>Krwpa </em>court concluded that the statute contained “no exception * * * based upon the number of weeks for which an employee of an educational institution actually works.” <em>See Krupa, </em><a href="/a2d/557/0868-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="557 A.2d 868" data-case-ids="7897198" data-case-paths="/a2d/557/0868-01">557 A.2d at 869</a>.

The department argues that the plain language of subsections (2) and (3) of § 28-44438 precludes the receipt of benefits by all its employees during customary vacation periods and that subsection (4) does not apply to any of the employees involved in these cases. It contends that the board’s decision to award benefits to some claimants is inconsistent with the statute’s plain language and contradicts this court’s decision in <em>Krwpa. </em>Because these claimants had a reasonable assurance of continued employment and applied for benefits relative to customary school vacations, they are not entitled to receive benefits, the department maintains.</p>
