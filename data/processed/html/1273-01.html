Gustee Brown, Esquire, a member of the Erie County Public Defender’s Office, provided legal counsel to Bretz in both cases. Attorney Brown was placed on inactive status by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, effective November 30, 2000, after he faded to remit the annual fee imposed by Pa.R.D.E. 219. It is undisputed that Attorney Brown was technically on inactive status during his representation of Bretz.</p>

C.S.A. § 3921(a), and three counts of criminal mischief, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3304(a)(1). On October 31, 2001, Bretz was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of three to seven years. Attorney Brown represented Bretz at all times through sentencing. Joseph P. Burt, Esquire, also an assistant public defender in Erie County, filed Bretz’s notice of appeal on November 15, 2001, followed by a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal on December 27, 2001. On appeal, Bretz challenged the trial court’s handling of <em>voir dire </em>and, in addition, argued that Attorney Brown rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a post-sentence motion raising that issue. A panel of this Court affirmed Bretz’s judgment of sentence on August 12, 2002. <em>Commonwealth v.

Bretz subsequently withdrew his plea and Attorney Brown was appointed to represent him. Attorney Brown advised Bretz to accept the plea agreement, which he did on April 18, 2001. Bretz was sentenced the same day to a term of incarceration of three to seven years, to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed at docket number 1393 of 2001.

Both petitions were premised upon the same argument, that Bretz was denied his federal constitutional right to counsel since Attorney Brown was on inactive status when he represented Bretz. At docket number 1393 of 2001, the PCRA court, the Honorable John A. Bozza, conducted an evidentiary hearing on January 27, 2003. By order dated January 28, 2003, Judge Bozza denied Bretz’s petition. <a id="p1275" href="#p1275" data-label="1275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1275</a>At docket number 3061 of 2000, the PCRA court, the Honorable Stephanie Domitro-vieh, notified Bretz on January 6, 2003, of its intent to dismiss his PCRA petition. The petition was formally dismissed, without a hearing, by order dated January 28, 2003. Bretz filed a notice of appeal from each of the PCRA court decisions on February 19, 2003. Because both of the appeals challenge the denial of post conviction relief on identical grounds, they have been consolidated for our review.</p>

The appellate briefs submitted by the parties are silent on this point, as is the PCRA court’s notice of dismissal, final order, and Rule 1925(a) opinion.

Bretz also failed to plead and prove that he was eligible for any of the enumerated exceptions to the Act’s timeliness requirement. Because the petition was untimely, it should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Although premised upon different grounds, the order of the PCRA court dismissing the petition is affirmed.</p>
