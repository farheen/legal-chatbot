According to Dantzler, “Mr. Schoenfeld did not prepare me for the hearing,” and he “never asked me detailed questions about the extent of my drug usage at the time of my arrest in this case,” or about “what connection that usage may have had to the offense of which I had been convicted.” Dantzler’s allegation that his attorney did not prepare him to testify finds at least some measure of corroboration in Dant-zler’s apparently bewildered responses to questions propounded by his counsel.

We have held that where the trial judge has determined, on the basis of the presentence report, that he will impose a mandatory minimum sentence regardless of whether the defendant qualifies for the addict exception, the judge need not hold an addict exception hearing. <em>Mozelle </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/a2d/612/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="612 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="7937770" data-case-paths="/a2d/612/0221-01">612 A.2d 221</a>, 223-24 (D.C.1992). In this case, the judge nevertheless held such a hearing. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the judge considered the question whether Dant-zler qualified for the addict exception to be at least potentially relevant to the sentence to be imposed.</p>
