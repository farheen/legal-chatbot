The basis of the complaint was the defendant’s liability as maker on two promissory notes, one for $5,000.00 dated September 12, 1970, and the other for $1,000.00 dated July 6, 1970, which notes had been assigned to the plaintiff. Additionally, the plaintiff sought an order to have defendant’s stock in two Maine corporations, Baxter Electronics and Baxter Associates, which could not be attached on the writ, taken on execution so that it could be sold in order to satisfy any judgment that the plaintiff might recover, <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>and that, pending; decision, the defendant be enjoined from transferring or assigning any interest which he may have in the aforesaid stock.</p>

No disposition was made for the other alleged demands and no judgment is outstanding as to them. Therefore, the complaint is still pending as to these additional items.</p>
