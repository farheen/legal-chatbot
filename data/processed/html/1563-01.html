The non-volatile liquid is further defined as having a higher surface tension than the volatile liquid and as “consisting essentially of an oxygen containing organic liquid.” The penetrant liquid consists of the volatile and relatively non-volatile portions. As the volatile liquid evaporates from a flaw, it will tend to leave a higher proportion of the non-volatile liquid in the remaining penetrant and increase its surface tension with the result that it will more readily exude from the flaw in the subsequent treatment defined in par.

Two of these opinions hold that the 606 application supports the counts. The third and dissenting opinion holds that it does not. The majority members considered that the language of the 5 counts, while broad, was not ambiguous. Thus they did not resort to the Sockman patent, in which they originated, to construe them. The dissenting member, on the other hand, found it necessary to resort to the file history of the patent in order to determine the meaning of the term in issue from the context in which it originated. Pie, therefore, construed the counts in the light of the Sockman specification and the prosecution of the application which resulted in the issuance of the Sockman patent. He also discussed and relied upon the substantial amount of evidence which' Sockman had introduced in the interference and which was not before the district court in <em>Switzer </em>v. <em>Watson. </em>Analyzing that evidence at length and comparing it with the evidence before the district court, the dissenting member concluded that the present record presented an entirely different picture than was before the district court and that this compelled a finding that the Switzer 606 application does not support the courts.</p>

Under the rules of the Patent Office (Buies 258(b) and (c)), matters so raised may be reviewed at final hearing and the prior art of record in the patent file may be referred to in construing the issue. There is a clear issue between the parties as to the meaning of “relatively non-volatile liquid consisting essentially of an oxygen-containing organic liquid.” Specifically, the language is such that there is a question whether it requires a <em>liquid </em>compound which <em>contains </em>oxygen as part of its chemical structure or whether it is satisfied by a solid oxygen-containing compound which is <em>included in </em>a hydrocarbon liquid.

This clearly indicates that the term in question means compounds <em>chemically containing oxygen </em>rather than compounds <em>in which oxygen is physically mixed. </em>That meaning, along with the further statement that the liquids may be characterized as being “oil free,” also indicates that Sockman required that the liquids must be liquids, not solids which are made liquid by reason of the addition of oils or hydrocarbons.

    <p id="b915-8" data-blocks='[["BL_915.8",915,[137,1504,1330,689]]]'>The emulsifier of Switzer example 5 is a combination of sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate and cyclohexanol. The dissenting board member concluded from the evidence that the combination of the two might reasonably be found to be a liquid and we will proceed on the basis that such a conclusion is correct. However, the witness Pollack testified that cyclohexanol is more volatile than ordinary kerosene, the latter being the first or volatile liquid component of the example 5 material. That testimony is not controverted by Switzer. It is thus not apparent that the mixture of sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate and cyclohexanol in the disclosed proportions, which are 18% and 27%, respectively, can be considered as necessarily being less volatile than the kerosene. It follows that one would not be satisfied that the mixture constitutes a relatively non-volatile liquid as required by the counts.</p>

That error was brought out in the interference <a id="p1576" href="#p1576" data-label="1576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1576</a>testimony and there is nothing to demonstrate that it was known to the district court. It is not seen that a compound not correctly identified can ordinarily furnish inherent support for a property when the compound is not specifically disclosed as having that property. Additionally, the emulsifier of example 7 was regarded in the evidence here as similar to the sodium salt designated as the emulsifier of example 4. The latter compound has already been found not necessarily to be a liquid chemically containing oxygen.</p>
    <p id="b916-3" data-blocks='[["BL_916.4",916,[220,642,1331,690]]]'>We think, for the above reasons, that the evidence before us but not before the district court requires the conclusion that the “oxygen-containing organic liquid” required by the counts is neither explicitly nor inherently disclosed in the Switzer 606 application. With respect to example 5, we do not think that the emulsifier, even if it is an oxygen containing liquid, has been shown to be “relatively nonvolatile” as further required by the counts. In reaching those conclusions, we have found ourselves in substantial agreement throughout with the analysis of the evidence by the dissenting board member. Since the majority board members did not expressly discuss the evidence as to the properties of the Switzer emulsifiers or disagree with the dissenter’s analysis thereof, it is apparent that such analysis represents the only ruling of any tribunal on the evidence here of record.</p>

It is stated that Switzer made no p.la.im to the invention of the counts until continuation-in-part application 484 was filed on January 26, 1955, which is 9½ years after Switzer first allegedly disclosed the invention in the 606 application. Sockman also points to the facts that (1) a rejection of the 606 application on double patenting based on the Ward patent was affirmed by this court and (2) the claims corresponding to the counts were introduced in the 484 application with its expanded specification rather than in the 606 application. Those circumstances are said to show that Switzer “exhausted all rights to make the counts.” Those questions, decided adversely to Sockman by the board, are moot here because of our decision that Sockman should prevail for reasons above stated.</p>
