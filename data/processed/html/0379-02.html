The Superior Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that <em>Williams </em>was not applicable to a non-capital case.

Just as the “need for ... independent judicial analysis does not depend upon the type of crime,” <em>Fulton, </em>— A.2d at —, <a href="/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201160755" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2002 WL 1160755">2002 WL 1160755</a>, at *3, neither does it depend upon the reason for the absence of an independent articulation by the court below of the reasons for its decisions. The only notable difference between our decisions in Williams and <em>Fulton </em>and the case <em>sub judice </em>is that the former involved a trial court’s <em>adoption </em>of the Commonwealth’s argument as to relevant appeal issues, while this case involves the trial court’s <em>silence </em>as to relevant appeal issues. Because that distinction concerning the <em>manner </em>in which the trial court failed to explain its decision is unrelated to the purpose of the Rule, it is of no moment. The trial court’s lapse here was no less an impediment to the appellate function than in Williams; <em>Fulton, </em>and other PCRA cases where this Court has ordered a remand on the same grounds. <em>See Fulton, </em>— A.2d at —, <a href="/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201160755" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2002 WL 1160755">2002 WL 1160755</a>, at *3 (collecting cases). Indeed, in any case where the trial court fails to prepare an opinion that addresses the issues upon which it passed and which are raised by a party on appeal, the net result is the same: the appellate court is deprived of explication and guidance on those issues from the judicial entity most familiar with the matter. Moreover, the parties may be left without a meaningful context within which to make their arguments on appeal, particularly as to discretionary matters. Those concerns are no less salient in the context of direct capital review than they are in the PCRA arena; nor are they less salient where the lower court is silent on appeal issues, as opposed to adopting the position of an advocate as the entire basis for its opinion.</p>
