In September 2004, however, the parties began negotiating the terms of a successor collective-bargaining agreement, to become effective upon the expiration of the existing agreement and remain so until June 30, 2008. The parties tentatively agreed upon it on January 25, 2005; it was voted upon and accepted by the RITBA board of directors on January 26; and two days later it was ratified by the covered employees. On March 16, 2005, RITBA and Service Employees ultimately executed the newly agreed upon collective-bargaining agreement.</p>

RITBA, however, filed an objection with the board, and later, joined by the incumbent union, filed a motion to dismiss United Service’s petition. The board granted this motion, relying upon the contract-bar doctrine, codified in G.L.1956 § 28-7-9(b)(2), which provides that the board shall not consider an intervenor union’s petition for an election while a collective-bargaining agreement remains effective between an incumbent union and an employer, except during a specific window period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Although United Service filed its petition during the window period applicable to the collective-bargaining agreement set to expire in June 2005, the board held that the successor contract executed by Service Employees and RITBA served as a bar to the petition. The board filed a written decision on August 17, 2005.</p>

The Superior Court adopted the premature extension rule, a doctrine extant in federal labor law providing that should parties to an existing collective-bargaining agreement agree during the contract’s term to extend its expiration date, the agreement is considered to be prematurely extended and a representation petition filed by a new bargaining agent will not be contract-barred if filed during the window period that applies to the original agreement’s termination date.

Yet, when the next window period of the collective-bargaining agreement opened, in 2008, United Service again filed a petition for an election with the board, which, this time, the board permitted. The RITBA employees voted for United Service as their representative, and the election was certified officially by the board on May 19, 2008. RITBA and United Service thereafter executed a collective-bargaining agreement effective until June 30, 2011.</p>
