    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[214,712,752,379]]]'>In 1989, plaintiff hired Kilborn to manage and invest his retirement funds. At the time, Kilborn was employed by Barclay. Kilborn left Barclay on May 31, 1991, and founded Blaekstone. He retained plaintiffs account in the process. The plaintiff continued his relationship with defendants until mid-1993.</p>

Between October 1989 and August 1991, Kilborn used $160,000 of plaintiffs money to purchase interests in certain mortgage loan investments from Security Finance Group, Inc. (SFG). In March 1993, plaintiff learned that an involuntary petition in bankruptcy had been filed against SFG and that his $160,000 investment was worthless. Subsequently, on October 12, 1993, after the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (DBR) began to investigate defendants’ conduct relative to SFG, defendants entered into a consent order with DBR. In the consent order, the director of DBR (director) found that defendants made misleading filings, violated Rhode Island securities laws, and breached their fiduciary duties to their clients by recommending and selling the SFG investments. The DBR found that Kilborn had limited knowledge and/or expertise with construction loans or as a real estate investor, that he never reviewed SFG’s financial statements or tax returns or any evidence of its ability to support and meet the investment’s contingent liability, and that he performed less than adequate due diligence concerning the viability and creditworthiness of the SFG investments.</p>
    <p id="b204-8" data-blocks='[["BL_204.9",204,[1012,415,756,1729]]]'>On June 10, 1994, plaintiff filed suit to recover the $160,000 that defendants had invested in SFG. The plaintiff asserted that defendants violated a number of federal and state securities laws, specifically the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. § 77a (1933 Act), the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-l (IAA), and the Rhode Island Uniform Securities Act of 1990, G.L.1956 chapter 11 of title 7 (RIU-SA)-<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The plaintiff also asserted common-law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and misrepresentation. The plaintiffs action was the third of four lawsuits filed against defendants by former investment clients. The two actions heard before plaintiffs action, <em>Kaplan v. Kilborn et al. </em>and <em>United Restaurant Equipment Co. v. Kilborn et al., </em>were both dismissed on statute-of-limitations grounds. Neither of those judgments was appealed. Consistent with those decisions, the motion justice in the instant case determined that the statute of limitations began to run on the statutory claims in March 1993, when plaintiff learned that his investments were worthless, and that plaintiffs action was time-barred because it was not filed within the requisite one-year period of limitation. As for the common-law claims, the motion justice concluded that they also should be dismissed because those claims were essentially subsumed by the state statutory claim, and that the one-year limitation, therefore, applied to them as well.</p>

First, plaintiff argues that the motion justice erred in holding that plaintiff failed to file his statutory and common-law claims within the time limited by the relevant statutes of limitations. The plaintiff argues that the correct date from which to trigger the statute of limitations <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>is October 12, 1993, when the consent order was entered with DBR and plaintiff actually learned about defendants’ misconduct. Second, plaintiff argues that the motion justice applied the wrong statute of limitations for the common-law claims. The plaintiff argues that the general ten-year period contained in G.L.1956 § 9-1-13 should have been applicable to the common-law claims, not the one-year period contained in RIUSA. These issues will be discussed in the order in which they are set forth in plaintiffs brief.</p>

The plaintiff, however, argues that he obtained notice of defendants’ violations only when the DBR released its consent order in October 1993. He argues that as of March 1993 he was aware only of SFG’s bankruptcy, which, he argues, could not give rise to inquiry notice concerning whether <em>defendants </em>had breached their fiduciary duties or were negligent.</p>

The defendants maintain that the SFG investments were offered to the public and made available for sale no later than October 1989, when defendants first purchased them for plaintiff. Therefore, defendants argue, that the statute of limitations expired in October 1992, almost two years before plaintiff filed his action. The defendants also argue that if the one-year discovery rule applies,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> plaintiff was clearly put on inquiry notice of possible claims against defendants when he learned, in <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>March 1993, that SFG was bankrupt and that his investments were worthless.</p>

We are of the opinion that neither element establishing federal preemption may be found in the Securities Act of 1933. We are of the opinion that these statutes were designed to define and strengthen the duties of brokers and investment advisers rather than to preempt preexisting common-law claims. One who seeks a remedy under common-law tort claims will not have the benefit of the liberal interpretation given by the federal and state statutes that has relieved some of the strictures of the common law. Consequently, we believe that neither the federal statute nor the state statute intended that their significantly shortened periods of limitations would apply to actions brought on such common-law claims.</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[211,2122,752,633]]]'>The defendants contend that plaintiffs common-law claims are barred by the economic-loss doctrine. This doctrine would make tort claims unavailable in circumstances in which the parties were in a contractual setting and the injuries were purely economic. The Superior Court did not consider this argument because the motion justice dismissed the claims on statute-of-limitations grounds. Since this issue was not decided by the motion justice, it is not appropriate for our consideration at this time.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[1013,250,752,589]]]'>For the reasons stated, the plaintiffs appeal is denied in part and sustained in part. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed insofar as it dismissed the federal and state statutory claims brought against the defendants, but is reversed insofar as it dismissed the common-law claims set forth in the plaintiffs amended complaint. The papers in the ease may be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings relating to the common-law claims consistent with this opinion.</p>

The defendants argue that plaintiffs claim under the 1933 Act arises under 15 U.S.C. § 77Z (1), and that 15 U.S.C. § 77m makes clear that the 1933 Act’s discovery rule is not available to plaintiffs alleging a violation of that section. The defendants are correct in that assertion. 15 U.S.C. § 77m provides that “[n]o action shall be maintained to enforce * * * a liability created under section * * * <em>771 </em>(1) of this title, unless brought within one year after the violation upon which it is based.”</p>
