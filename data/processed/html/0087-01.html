We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[218,912,754,573]]]'>Brome is currently a prisoner at SCI-Greene. A hearing was initially held in this matter on February 27, 1997, but for reasons unknown to the Department, the reporter hired to transcribe that hearing did not prepare a transcript or forward one to the Department. Efforts to obtain a transcript from the February 1997 hearing were unsuccessful. Consequently, on March 5, 1999, this Court ordered the Commonwealth to conduct another hearing in this matter.</p>

Brome filed exceptions in which he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The Department responded with the observation that, though the evidence presented could have been more detailed, there was sufficient credible evidence to support the total amount of expenses incurred because of Brome’s misconduct. The Department also observed that the determination of the assessment against Brome was the only issue and Brome’s attempt to challenge the facts of the underlying misconduct was not at issue. The Department found Brome’s exceptions without merit and ordered he reimburse the Commonwealth the amount of $19,544. Brome petitions for review to this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b122-9" data-blocks='[["BL_122.9",122,[1019,771,752,882]]]'>Brome raises seven issues for our review. Those are: 1) the Department lacked the authority to require him to pay medical costs in treating Officer Campbell, 2) the two-year statute of limitations prohibited the Department from holding his second <em>Holloway </em>hearing; 3) the Department did not suffer any loss; 4) the Department can not be considered a victim so it is not entitled to restitution or money damages; 5) an administrative policy does not govern this matter; 6) Brome was prejudiced at the administrative hearing since he was not provided the rules governing that action; and 7) the hearing examiner’s findings of fact lack legal authority. Each of Brome’s arguments is addressed below.</p>

In addition, any sanctions permitted for Class II misconducts are also permitted for Class I misconducts, a class that includes assault and aggravated assault. 37 Pa.Code § 93.10(a)(l)(ii). The Department had the authority to assess Brome’s account to pay the medical costs of treating Officer Campbell. This authority also refutes Brome’s fifth claim that this matter is not governed by an administrative policy.</p>
    <p id="b123-4" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[120,1083,758,769]]]'>Next, no statute of limitation applies to the assessment, as that assessment was a statutorily authorized consequence of Brome’s being found guilty of institution misconduct. <em>Greene v.

    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[119,1874,750,475]]]'>Third, Brome’s assertion that the Department did not suffer a loss because it is covered by insurance lacks merit. The Department is a self-insured agency that is required to reimburse the Worker’s Compensation Board and is not precluded from seeking reimbursement for medical expenses paid pursuant to Section 1 of the Act of December 8, 1959, P.L. 1718, <em>as amended, </em>61 P.S. § 951.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

C.S. § 1106, a section pertaining to court-ordered restitution following the conviction of a crime.</p>
    <p id="b123-11" data-blocks='[["BL_123.12",123,[921,694,752,522]]]'>However, the Department is an administrative agency, not a government agency, and also is not a criminal trial court with sentencing powers under the Crimes Code, which can order payment of restitution. <em>Anderson. </em>Following our decision in <em>Anderson, </em>the <em>Runion </em>decision does not apply to Brome’s situation because <em>Runion </em>deals with restitution for a crime and not for payment under <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2093.10" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="37 Pa.

    <p id="b123-12" data-blocks='[["BL_123.13",123,[917,1243,755,769]]]'>Sixth, Brome claims he was prejudiced at his administrative hearing because he was not provided the rules regarding administrative hearing procedures. Brome’s administrative hearing was conducted pursuant to The Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 504-507, Practice and Procedure of Commonwealth Agencies, a statute Brome had access to in the law library of SCI-Greene. The record shows Brome received this Court’s order requiring that the hearing be scheduled followed by the notice of the hearing. There is nothing in the record showing that, at that time, he requested information about the hearing procedures.</p>
    <p id="b123-13" data-blocks='[["BL_123.14",123,[915,2035,755,429]]]'>Finally, Brome asserts that the Department’s findings of fact lack any legal justification, despite the hearing examiner’s written proposed report wherein he outlined his findings of fact and the reasons for his decision. In <em>Holloway, </em>this Court established the minimum due process requirements owed to one who has lost property as a result of a state agency action.</p>

At the hearing, the hearing examiner entered a copy of the notice as exhibit E and copies of Brome’s Departmental misconducts for riot, assault, aggravated assault, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, possession of contraband and Brome’s presence in an unauthorized area as exhibits R1 through R4.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[218,1441,753,769]]]'>In addition, the budget analyst at SCI-Greene was sworn and testified regarding Brome’s sanction assessment of $19,544 at SCI-Camp Hill dated December 4, 1990, and submitted a copy of Department records delineating the costs for the treatment of Officer Campbell totaling $38,-764.84. Brome then had the opportunity to, and did, cross-examine the budget analyst with respect to any of the proffered documents or testimony. Brome then testified and entered exhibits into the record. As the above discussion demonstrates, Brome’s appeal of the Department’s decision assessing his inmate account lacks merit.</p>
