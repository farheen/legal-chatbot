The word “GRID” in the mark sought to be registered is, therefore, purely descriptive of the enumerated goods and without trademark significance. The specimen filed with the application is a label showing a drawing of the goods across the top of which are the words, “LOOK FOR THE GRID WITH THE LID” and beneath which is the mark “THE GOLDEN GRID.”</p>

Sales and advertising of goods under marks having “GOLDEN” as a component prior to appellee’s entry into the field must have been very substantial. The exact amount is quite unimportant.</p>
    <p id="b845-3" data-blocks='[["BL_845.4",845,[118,670,1328,549]]]'>Before appellee’s first use of the mark, opposer was already established in the television receiver field with several “Golden” trademarks. The exhibits show that marks of which “Golden” is a component were used, displayed, and advertised <em>together </em>prior to appellee’s date of first use. Whether or not the situation is categorized as one in which opposer has a “family” of marks — appellee contending that it is not — we agree with opposer’s contensions that prior to the earliest use of appellee’s mark opposer had established a pattern of using marks comprising “Golden” as the <em>dominant </em>feature on electronic goods in the radio and television industries and that appellee’s use of its mark fell into that pattern.</p>
    <p id="b845-4" data-blocks='[["BL_845.5",845,[117,1225,1329,298]]]'>In our judgment, it is quite likely that at least a substantial number of purchasers or users of appellee’s electron guns, grids, or the TV picture tubes bearing the labels indicating that they are incorporated therein — which is a manner of marking specified in the application practiced by appellee’s customers — would attribute origin to opposer. This is sufficient reason, under section 2(d), for denying registration.</p>
    <p id="b845-5" data-blocks='[["BL_845.6",845,[118,1529,1328,1002]]]'>While, as the board pointed out in its opinion on reconsideration, the “Golden” marks were used together in conjunction with the primary mark “Motorola,” this strikes us as a fact of little significance. If a TV receiver contains a “GOLDEN M” chassis, “GOLDEN M” and “GOLDEN SATELLITE” vacuum tubes, all orginating with Motorola, it would seem to be more than likely that one would expect a picture tube for the same set, either original or replacement, bearing a “GOLDEN GRID” label, to have had the same origin. Were it otherwise, the significance of the word “Golden” as an indicator of origin would be close to zero. Insofar as it would serve to indicate origin, we think it would be as likely to indicate origin in opposer as in appellee. The annexation of the word “grid” to the word “golden” would not alter this by reason of the fact that “grid” is purely descriptive. The board seemed to feel that it would be otherwise, saying, “the word ‘GRID’ in applicant’s mark, while of a merely descriptive nature, is still sufficient to distinguish applicant’s mark from each of opposer’s marks.”  We cannot agree. Furthermore, the issue is not whether the <em>marks </em>can be distinguished, but whether in concurrent use on the goods involved they are likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception.</p>

      <a id="p1522" href="#p1522" data-label="1522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1522</a>There are ten third-party registrations of record on marks comprising two words the first of which is “Golden” and used on various goods in the electrical field. The board considered five of these pertinent to this appeal. Appellee also introduced copies of some advertisements in which the word “GOLDEN” was used in various ways. 'This evidence, plus the dictionary meanings of “golden” led the board to conclude that “such term has a highly suggestive significance.” In view of this undoubted fact and the indication that others than op-poser may have used the word “Golden” in the electrical field, the board concluded that opposer had not established that it had a “family” of “Golden” marks, despite its extensive use and advertising thereof. As a matter of logic it would seem to us that  if opposer has ,a family of six marks all starting with the non-descriptive word “Golden,” it still has that family notwithstanding there may be some others using the same word to some undisclosed extent.</p>

We agreed that it was no basis for finding the existence of a family of marks and held it should be given little weight in determining whether marks for milk  products are “confusingly similar,” which is a shorthand expression indicating that we do not think concurrent use of the marks is likely to <em>cause </em>confusion.</p>
