Furthermore, the duration of the commute, which is approximately two hours round-trip, is not unreasonable for the eight hour workday that is required for this full-time position. Finally, the vocational expert testified that it was common for persons in the York area (where Appellant lives) to travel to Lancaster to work.</p>
    <p id="b1165-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1165.11",1165,[980,1065,757,741]]]'>As for the economic factors that Appellant would have this Court consider, which include low pay ($4.50 per hour) and expense of the commute, we find these factors to be of no moment because the Workmen’s Compensation Act provides partial disability payments based on the difference between the earning power of the claimant and his pre-injury wage. 77 P.S. § 512. We note that the partial weekly disability payment of $214.76 which Appellant was awarded plus the potential gross weekly wages of $180.00 from the coupon sorter position exceed the amount of the total disability payment of $334.76 per week Appellant was previously receiving.</p>
    <p id="b1165-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1165.12",1165,[979,1827,754,500]]]'>We therefore find that the determination that the Employer met its burden as detailed in the second prong of the <em>Kachinski </em>analysis is supported by substantial evidence. Although Appellant’s personal preference may have been not to sort coupons and commute forty-seven miles one way for the $4.50 per hour position, we must conclude, under the facts of this case, that these non-medical factors do not render the proffered job unsuitable.</p>
