    <p id="b966-12" data-blocks='[["BL_966.15",966,[276,1055,1327,399]]]'>This appeal is from the decision of the Board of Patent Interferences awarding priority of invention in Interference No. 91,619 to Charles C. Bland, the senior party. Bland’s involved application, serial No. 677,651, was filed on August 12, 1957 and is assigned to Flex-O-Lite Manufacturing Corporation. The junior party, Frederic O. Hess, is involved on the basis of his application serial No. 804,466, filed April 6, 1959, assigned to Selas Corporation of America and licensed exclusively to Potters Brothers, Incorporated.</p>
    <p id="b966-13" data-blocks='[["BL_966.16",966,[276,1460,1328,248]]]'>The interference relates to a process for making glass beads or spheres.

A blast of high velocity gas is discharged against the stream at substantially a right angle to the stream to disperse it into a multiplicity of glass particles. The blast of gas carries the particles through a path which is maintained at an elevated temperature to allow the particles to be shaped into spheres as a result of surface tension. The spheres are then cooled so that they solidify and are collected. The single count of the interference reads:</p>

    <p id="b967-5" data-blocks='[["BL_967.5",967,[158,1010,1325,349]]]'>The question to be determined is whether certain tests performed in a laboratory of Selas from June through mid-September of 1954 amounted to reduction of the invention to practice. The board concluded they did not. Since the record shows no activity on behalf of Hess from September 1954 until his application was filed in 1959, there is no contention that Hess can prevail on the basis of earlier conception followed by diligence.</p>
    <p id="b967-6" data-blocks='[["BL_967.6",967,[158,1365,1326,499]]]'>The record shows that Selas engaged in engineering and research development work in the combustion and heat application fields for its own direct benefit in the production and sale of burner products and in similar work in developing processes and products for customers in the hope of selling them Selas’ burner products. Potters Brothers, one of Selas’ customers, was a manufacturer of glass beads and “glitter,” the beads being an ingredient of “reflectorized” white and yellow paint used for marking highways and for directional, traffic guidance, and warning signs. Selas itself was not in the business of producing glass beads.</p>
    <p id="b967-7" data-blocks='[["BL_967.7",967,[158,1870,1325,590]]]'>In the spring of 1954, Selas, through Hess, its president, proposed an agreement with Potters Brothers for Selas to conduct research work toward developing a new process for the production of glass beads. That proposal was accepted by Potters Brothers. Hess then advised the head of the research department, Furczyk, and an assistant, Hen-wood, of his concept for producing glass spheres directly from a stream of molten glass. He stated that they should build a small melting unit with an outlet at the bottom to provide a glass stream and apply a superheat burner to disperse the glass stream. He also discussed building a heating chamber and a collecting chamber and running tests to “verify whether the idea is practical and whether it works.”</p>

During the period starting sometime in June 1954 and ending July 21,1954, Liddell, assisted by another technician, Hepburn, ran a series of tests. Those tests, designated tests Nos. 1 through IT, are described in laboratory notebook No. 47, which Liddell obtained for reporting experiments on the glass sphere project for Potters Brothers. The pages of the notebook pertinent to tests Nos. 1 through 17 were introduced in evidence and testimony concerning them given by Liddell and other witnessess. Those tests involved causing melted glass in a crucible to spill out through an orifice and projecting the flame of a superheat burner transversely of the stream of glass to deflect it, but apparently did not employ either a chamber to maintain the heat of the deflected glass or collecting means, Liddell conceded that the process did not operate successfully during those tests and Hess does not rely on them as constituting reduction to practice.</p>
    <p id="b968-3" data-blocks='[["BL_968.4",968,[295,1145,1330,448]]]'>After the last of Liddell’s tests, work on the glass sphere project was continued by Chen, a research engineer for Selas. Chen first discussed the project with Henwood and Furczyk around August 3, 1954, on which date he summarized his conclusions regarding Liddell’s work in the Selas laboratory notebook on the project. Subsequently, Chen reported in the notebook on tests Nos. 18 through 26, conducted between August 4, 1954 and September 3, 1954, and test No. 27, in the form of a demonstration for representatives of Potters Brothers conducted on September 13, 1954.</p>

    <p id="b968-5" data-blocks='[["BL_968.6",968,[295,1853,1327,285]]]'>Tests 18 through 27 utilized a hot chamber for maintaining at an elevated temperature the area through which the glass particles blasted from the molten stream pass, in order to cause the particles to coalesce into beads of spherical shape as the result of surface tension.

    <p id="b972-4" data-blocks='[["BL_972.5",972,[264,574,1329,552]]]'>As stated in <em>Corona Cord Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Dovan Chemical Corp., </em>276 N.S. 358, a process is reduced to practice when it is successfully performed. Applying that criterion to the facts of the present case, we are not satisfied that the board erred in finding Hess did not reduce to practice. The count defines a process of producing beads in spherical form. Yet the beads formed in the tests were of questionable quality so far as spherical form is concerned and many were unusable for use as reflecting beads as the parties contemplated for the additional reason that they had air bubbles. Moreover, the record does not establish that beads of the size, shape and quality actually produced were known to be suitable for any specific purpose.</p>
    <p id="b972-5" data-blocks='[["BL_972.6",972,[264,1133,1327,499]]]'>It is clear that the witnesses generally took a more optimistic view of the test results in their testimony in 1962 than their statements and action reported contemporaneously with the tests would appear to warrant. Under those circumstances, we are inclined to place greater weight on the contemporaneous reports and action. On that basis, we must agree with the board’s view that the record leaves a clear impression that the experimenters were not satisfied in 1954 that the process had been performed successfully. The fact that Exhibit 20, quoted above, reports on suggestions for further tests after test No. 27 strongly supports that conclusion.</p>

That testimony of Wood was given in 1962 and, even at that date, nearly eight years after the tests, no specific use for such beads was specified. Wood’s testimony further included the statement in connection with test No. 27, the only test he witnessed, that the beads contained “a substantially large amount of larger sizes” than normally manufactured for the “highway trade” and that the <a id="p1649" href="#p1649" data-label="1649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1649</a>amount of air bubbles was such that the beads “would have to be used in areas that did not require optical properties or structural properties.” Wood’s 1962 testimony must be weighed with the report by Chen in 1954 that “The quality of the spheres was not satisfactory [to Potter and Wood] * * * because of the size and the roundness.”</p>
    <p id="b973-4" data-blocks='[["BL_973.4",973,[196,553,1324,692]]]'>With respect to the air bubbles which occurred in the beads of tests Nos. 26 and 27, Hess further relies on an affidavit which the party Bland filed in his application as evidence of usefulness of beads having bubbles. In the affidavit, filed in 1960, Bland referred to certain beads he had produced as “of a spherical nature” and “of an 80 mesh size and smaller,” about 25 per cent of which “had air inclusions which were less than ¾ °f the diameter of the beads.” He stated those beads were of an acceptable nature and met various government specifications and had commercial utility. That affidavit is not significant here since it is not established +hat Hess’ beads had the same qualities as those Bland refers to. In particular, it has not been shown that the Hess beads were of the same quality so far as “spherical nature” is concerned or that the air inclusions were less than ¾ of the diameter of the beads.</p>
    <p id="b973-5" data-blocks='[["BL_973.5",973,[194,1260,1329,451]]]'>It is further argued by Hess that neither the crack that developed in the chamber of test No. 21 nor the sticking of the glass to the hot chamber walls during tests Nos. 24 and 26 were considered problems. However, there would seem to be considerable doubt that a run that broke down after only thirty seconds operation producing only a small number of beads of questionable quality, as did test No. 21, could be regarded as a successful operation of the process amounting to a reduction to practice even if the operator thought he could avoid the cracking in future operations.</p>

It seems to have been regarded seriously by Furczyk for he then questioned why the amount of glass issuing from the chamber was not as much as it should be and expressed <em>“deep disappointment” </em>in the test and “great concern” over the progress of the project. Even though a new nozzle was used in test No. 24, the percentage of the glass sticking on the chamber wall was noted. When test No. 25 using a different nozzle with the same size chamber as test No. 24 failed to operate satisfactorily, a smaller diameter chamber was used in test No. 26. However, “quite an amount of glass” again stuck to the chamber wall and it was noted that the total amount of spheres and fibers produced was small compared to the amount of glass batch fed into the crucible. Moreover, Chen conceded in his testimony that, even after test No. 27, the problem of <em>getting the </em>chamber large enough to avoid excessive deposit of the glass on its <a id="p1650" href="#p1650" data-label="1650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1650</a>walls while avoiding excessive heat loss was unresolved. Also, Chen testified that he stacked bricks over the open end of the chamber to heat it up before starting operation of the tests and the record shows that the chamber temperature tended to drop rapidly upon removal of the bricks to permit operation.</p>
    <p id="b974-4" data-blocks='[["BL_974.4",974,[282,533,1332,1110]]]'>Hess argues that the board failed to recognize the significance of the payment of $25,000 to Selas by Potters Brothers, urging that the agreement between the two required payment of that amount only in the event of a successful development. While the payment is a factor to be considered, and the board did consider it, we do not think it is convincing that, a reduction to practice had been achieved. The agreement expressly stated that the arrangement was “based on the assumption that the process will prove considerably more economical than your [Potters Brothers’] present process, and possibly entail other operational advantages -which would more than reimburse Potters Brothers for this final payment, as well as the cost of the experiments.” Yet Wood testified that “the ultimate cost of beads as produced from the batch through the Hess process * * * would cost more than our system.” It is thus apparent that Potters Brothers accepted less than full compliance with the terms of the agreement as the basis for payment of $25,000. In fact, the only specific testimony regarding the payment is Wood’s answer “yes” to the inquiry on cross examination: “You paid $25,000 for the experimental work, didn’t you?” It is not explained when that amount was paid or under what conditions nor whether that was the total amount paid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Under these circumstances, the fact that $25,000 was paid “for the experimental work” is not convincing evidence that a reduction to practice was attained.</p>
    <p id="b974-5" data-blocks='[["BL_974.5",974,[289,1650,1323,295]]]'>Another argument of Hess is that it is difficult to believe that Selas would have scheduled the demonstration, test No. 27, for Potters Brothers if the performance of the equipment had left doubts that it would function properly. However, that argument is not at all persuasive of a reduction to practice under the facts of the present case. Thus, Henwood testified as follows:</p>
