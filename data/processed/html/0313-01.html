Further, the Court has recently reiterated that “in such circumstances, the imposition of identical discipline should be close to automatic, with minimum review by both the Board and this court.” <em><a href="/a2d/711/1262-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="711 A.2d 1262" data-case-ids="11833001" data-case-paths="/a2d/711/1262-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing <em>In re Cole, </em><a href="/a2d/809/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="809 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="11431212" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/1226-01">809 A.2d 1226</a>, 1228 n. 3 (D.C.2002)). The Court has explained that “[underlying that principle is a general reluctance by the court to have the disciplinary law of the District of Columbia— concerning both misconduct and sanctions — developed in proceedings that are characterized by deference to another jurisdiction’s judgment and also by the absence of ‘that clear concreteness provided when a question emerges ... for a decision from a clash of adversary argument.’ ” <em><a href="/a2d/809/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="809 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="11431212" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/1226-01">Id.</a> </em>(quoting <em>In re Goldsborough, </em><a href="/a2d/654/1285-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="654 A.2d 1285" data-case-ids="7879377" data-case-paths="/a2d/654/1285-01">654 A.2d 1285</a>, 1287-88 n. 5 (D.C.1995)). In the instant case, Respondent has failed to <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>make any effort to rebut the presumption of reciprocal discipline, thereby “effectively defaulting]” on this issue. <em>Goldsborough, </em><a href="/a2d/654/1285-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="654 A.2d 1285" data-case-ids="7879377" data-case-paths="/a2d/654/1285-01">654 A.2d at 1287</a>.</p>

Specifically, (1) Respondent was accorded due process; (2) there was no infirmity of proof; (3) the imposition of the same discipline in the District of Columbia would not result in grave injustice; (4) Respondent’s conduct contravened the ethical rules of this jurisdiction; and (5) such conduct merits the identical discipline in the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p id="b349-7" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[112,1180,753,1077]]]'>With respect to due process, the Board is satisfied from the HO Report that Respondent had actual notice of the investigation by the WSBA, and that he participated in certain • aspects of the investigation. The HO Report reflects that the Respondent did not participate in the hearing but did receive service by mail of the HO Report. Although the discipline imposed by the Washington Court was by default, it was based on substantial evidence introduced at the ev-identiary hearing and reflected in the HO Report. Given this record, the Board finds that Respondent was not denied due process by the imposition of default discipline. <em>See, e.g., In re Sumner, </em><a href="/a2d/762/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="762 A.2d 528" data-case-ids="11153560" data-case-paths="/a2d/762/0528-01">762 A.2d 528</a> (D.C.2000) (reciprocal discipline imposed based on default where respondent had notice of foreign proceeding but did not participate).</p>

There is no evidence that Respondent actually received notice of the reciprocal proceedings in this jurisdiction. Mailings made by the Executive Attorney of the Board on Professional Responsibility to the Respondent’s primary and secondary address with the D.C. Bar were returned as undeliverable. An additional notice mailed by the Office of Bar Counsel to a service address reflected in the HO Report was also returned. Also, unsuccessful efforts were made by an investigator working for the Office of Bar Counsel to locate a current address for Respondent using the internet and the Lexis Nexis public record system. However, consistent with the Court’s findings in <em>In re Smith, </em><a href="/a2d/812/0931-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="812 A.2d 931" data-case-ids="11372644" data-case-paths="/a2d/812/0931-01">812 A.2d 931</a> (D.C.2002), because Respondent failed to report his Washington disbarment to Bar Counsel as required by D.C. Bar R. XI, § 11(b) and failed to update his address with the D.C. Bar as required by D.C. Bar R.
