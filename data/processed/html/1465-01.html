    <p id="b785-19" data-blocks='[["BL_785.23",785,[136,1598,1328,243]]]'>This appeal is from a decision of the Board of Appeals, adhered to on reconsideration, sustaining the examiner’s rejection of claim 1<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of appellant’s patent application.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The issue presented is one of double patenting and, more particularly, the determinative question involves the effect of a terminal disclaimer filed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 253.</p>

The claimed mixture includes ethylene oxide as the active sterilizing agent. Since ethylene oxide is highly flammable and, under certain conditions, explosive, it has been found necessary to dilute it with nonflammable material. Appellant’s specification indicates that some success has been achieved in the prior art by diluting the ethylene oxide with carbon dioxide. However, the problem of flammability still persists to a substantial degree even with such a mixture, since the carbon <a id="p1466" href="#p1466" data-label="1466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1466</a>dioxide evaporates at a markedly lower temperature (and/or higher pressure) than the ethylene oxide, thus leaving behind fairly concentrated amounts of the flammable material.</p>
    <p id="b786-4" data-blocks='[["BL_786.4",786,[207,421,1322,545]]]'>Appellant alleges that he has been able to solve the problem by incorporating into the mixture, along with the ethylene oxide, carefully controlled amounts of two substances, dicblorotetrafluoroethane (Freon 114) and trichloromonofluoromethane (Freon 11). These substances are both flammability suppressants, and the proportions are selected such that the mixture is nonflammable in all liquid-vapor phase relationships. Thus, since Freon 11 has a higher boiling point and a lower vapor pressure than ethylene oxide, while Freon 114 has a lower boiling point and a higher vapor pressure, the ethylene oxide is at all times diluted to at least the point of nonflammability, regardless of temperature or pressure conditions under normal use.,</p>

      <a id="p1467" href="#p1467" data-label="1467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1467</a>It can be readily seen that the differences are two: (1) appealed claim 1 specifies a mixture of Freon 11 and Freon 114 while Kaye claim 1 calls for Freon 11 and Freon 12; and (2) the equations defining the proportions of the three ingredients are, of course, different. The board apparently considered the differences to be so slight that the two claims define but one invention; in affirming the rejection of appealed claim 1, the board merely said “It is fundamental that only one patent may be granted for a single invention.” While this statement may be correct, see <em>In re Siu, </em><a href="/ccpa/42-2/0864-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 C.C.P.A. 864" data-case-ids="6078794" data-case-paths="/ccpa/42-2/0864-01">42 CCPA 864</a>, <a href="/f2d/222/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="222 F.2d 267" data-case-ids="49656,6078794" data-case-paths="/f2d/222/0267-01,/ccpa/42-2/0864-01">222 F. 2d 267</a>, <a href="/ccpa/42-2/0864-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 C.C.P.A. 864" data-case-ids="6078794" data-case-paths="/ccpa/42-2/0864-01">105 USPQ, 428</a>, it does not state the issue presently before us, for as we shall point out in more detail, we do not agree that appealed claim 1 and Kaye claim 1 define a single invention.</p>
    <p id="b787-4" data-blocks='[["BL_787.4",787,[113,873,1325,850]]]'>It is difficult to see how it can be reasonably argued that the two claims set forth above relate to the same invention. It is apparent that both claims relate to the same broad, basic idea. But as we have pointed out, appealed claim 1 employs Freon 114 as one of the flammability suppressants, while Kaye claim 1 uses Freon 12. To say the two mixtures are the <em>.same, </em>then, would be tantamount to saying that, insofar as this particular type of sterilant preparation is concerned, Freon 114 and Freon 12 are the “same.” This we cannot do. Moreover, the equations defining the proportions of ingredients for the two claims are necessarily different because Freon 114 and Freon 12 have different boiling points and vapor pressures. Proper selection of such proportions is essential to the success of each of the claimed mixtures, and the proportion equation for one mixture would clearly not be applicable to the other.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In view of such differences, therefore, we cannot say that appealed claim 1 and Kaye claim 1 define the same invention. Our analysis indicates that there are definitely two separate, though related, inventions involved here.'</p>
    <p id="b787-5" data-blocks='[["BL_787.5",787,[115,1729,1323,295]]]'>We must next consider whether these two separate inventions are <em>patentabh] distinct </em>from one another. For if they are not, then to allow a patent for appealed claim 1 would be to extend beyond its lawful term the monopoly which appellant now enjoys with respect to Kaye claim 1. E.g., <em>In re Christensen, </em><a href="/ccpa/51-2/1236-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="51 C.C.P.A. 1236" data-case-ids="6092311" data-case-paths="/ccpa/51-2/1236-01">51 CCPA 1236</a>, <a href="/f2d/330/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="330 F.2d 652" data-case-ids="127962,6092311" data-case-paths="/f2d/330/0652-01,/ccpa/51-2/1236-01">330 F. 2d 652</a>, <a href="/ccpa/51-2/1236-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="51 C.C.P.A. 1236" data-case-ids="6092311" data-case-paths="/ccpa/51-2/1236-01">141 USPQ 295</a>.</p>
