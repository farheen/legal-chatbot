    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[103,432,1335,1700]]]'>Appellant insists with great earnestness that he is entitled to the’ allowance of claim é, which embodies the combination of old elements only, because he has reduced aeroplane night advertising to a success when prior to his entering the field, it had been a complete and abandoned failure. He characterizes the reference Mitchell, which is the reference with which we are chiefly concerned, as “ a failure, inoperative and worthless.” He admits the different elements of his combination, with the exception of those for which claims were allowed, to be old in the art. He shows, and we think convincingly, by affidavits and argument, that the Mitchell patent was of little value as a commercial enterprise, and that the same, after repeated trials at great expense, had been abandoned. He points out that in the Mitchell patent signs are fastened to the undersurface of the aeroplane wings by means of a series of hangers and slotted angle bars; that certain metal channels are adjustably fastened to the angle bars and are shaped to conform to the particular character of the sign; that within these channel bars is mounted a series of incandescent electric lamps connected by elaborate wiring to a heavy storage battery which supplies illuminating current ; that the channels serve as reflectors; that the advertising device is cumbersome in character and more than twice 'the thickness of the aeroplane wing supporting it; that it projects in front of the wing and in the rear of same, interfering with the air currents necessary for the efficient and safe flying of the plane; that after repeated experiments the weight of the electrical apparatus could not be reduced to less than 500 pounds; that it was difficult to get the aero-plane, so loaded, off the ground; that high flying was not possible, if the advertising was to be read; that low flying was dangerous and eventually regarded as impracticable; that the vibrations of the machine broke the incandescent lamp filaments and that the battery did not afford enough current to last for a display of longer than 15 minutes; that various noted aviators by affidavits (in the record) pronounced it a failure as a commercial enterprise and to be dangerous and impracticable of operation. .</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[109,2140,1323,133]]]'>Appellant argues from these premises that Mitchell’s device is inojjerative and that an inoperative structure is an improper reference.</p>
