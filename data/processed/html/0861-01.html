      <a id="p862" href="#p862" data-label="862" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*862</a>There was some difference of opinion upon remand as to what was actually required by this court’s prior decision in this case. The uncertainty seemed to stem from the fact that there was a majority opinion and two concurring opinions; and it apparently was not clear to the parties whether some faults found by the majority opinion were ascribable to a majority of the court. We need not discuss these disputes here, however, because any such uncertainties were largely removed by this court’s subsequent opinion in Northeast Liquors, Inc. v. District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, D.C.App., <a href="/a2d/302/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="302 A.2d 222" data-case-ids="11249676" data-case-paths="/a2d/302/0222-01">302 A.2d 222</a> (1973).</p>
