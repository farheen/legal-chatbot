Be: cause of the pendency of a suit for specific performance of the contract, brought in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia by Anderson, the purchaser, against the vendor, the court, on motion of the defendant, ordered the action abated. From this order the appeal was taken.</p>

Af-fiant therefore says that plaintiff is entitled to judgment for possession of said property.”</p>

It alleged that the defendant obtained possession by fraud “and has trespassed thereon”, and that he has refused to surrender possession. That the defendant entered by actual force or violence, or that he retained possession by force, or by menaces .or other acts legally equivalent to force, was not alleged. On the contrary, the allegations negatived the employment of force in either entry or detention.</p>

That section was adopted without change in the Revised Statutes of 1874 and with added clauses in the Codes of 1901, 1929, and 1940, our present law.

The court said: “A mere unlawful entry into lands, though it would justify the common averment of vi et armis, or force and arms, is not the forcible entry contemplated by the statute. It must be something more, either an original entry or subsequent de-tainer, with strong hand; and this may be by the use of actual force and violence, or by menace of force, accompanied by arms and a manifest intent to carry such threat into effect, or by a show of force, calculated to create terror and alarm, by an exhibition of arms, a display of numbers, or other means manifesting an open and visible determination forcibly to make the entry, or forcibly to resist the entry of another.”</p>
