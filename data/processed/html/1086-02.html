Upon leaving Don’s Bar, the victim and John Murray visited with a friend, Helene Edwards, in the Sun Village area of Chester. Ms. Jones left Ms. Edwards’ home, and, when Mr. Murray attempted to accompany her, she told him she was going to a friend’s house.

Michael Smith observed the woman at the time this request was made and later identified the woman who accompanied the Appellant as Ms. Jones. Appellant did not appear to Michael Smith to be intoxicated or “high” on drugs at the time he lent Appellant his car. Appellant later returned the car keys to Michael Smith at approximately 12:30 a.m. on November 19, 1994. On the afternoon of November 19, 1994, Appellant stated to his brother, Jeffrey Smith, that he had murdered Ms. Jones in Sun Village Park by choking her with his hands and with a belt.</p>

While in police custody, Appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he waived. Appellant then provided detectives with a tape-recorded statement, which was transcribed and admitted into evidence at trial. In this statement, Appellant stated that he had borrowed his nephew’s car so that he could buy drugs, and that the victim had agreed to have sex with him in exchange for drugs. Appellant stated that he and the victim had gone to Sun Village Park. When Appellant attempted to have sex with the victim on the ground, he became concerned that she would accuse him of having raped her.

Appellant admitted his guilt to third degree murder of the victim, and urged that this cocaine-induced psychosis evidence would allow the jury to mitigate the charge of first degree murder to third degree murder on the basis of section 308 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 308.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Dr. Berman testified that toxic psychosis, a condition that occurs due to cocaine intoxication, is a recognized psychiatric disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (DSM-4), which is relied upon by psychiatrists in diagnosing patients. Dr. Berman testified that toxic psychosis from cocaine intoxication can occur in individuals at varying dosage levels and cause hallucinations and delusions. Dr. Berman reviewed the autopsy reports and chemical analyses which were performed on the victim and interviewed Appellant. Dr. Berman opined that Appellant was suffering from a cocaine-induced psychotic disorder at the time that he strangled the victim to death. It was Dr. Berman’s expert medical opinion that Appellant was unable to form the specific intent to kill the victim. On cross-examination by the prosecution, Dr. Berman explained that his opinion was based on his review of the autopsy reports performed on the victim, as well as his interview of Appellant, Appellant’s statement, and the Affidavit of Probable Cause. Moreover, on cross-examination Dr. Berman testified that although he had no knowledge of the amount of cocaine Appellant ingested, the effect of a cocaine-induced psychotic experience is not determined by the amount of cocaine ingested by an individual but by an individual’s usage of the drug over a period of time and the manner in which it is ingested. Additionally, on cross-examination, Dr. Berman explained how, from the psychiatric standpoint, Appellant could have been aware that he was physically strangling the victim yet unable to “turn off’ his psychosis. Dr. Berman testified on cross-examination that Appellant’s ability to physically carry out his plans at the time of the killing did not affect his psychiatric opinion that Appellant was suffering from toxic psychosis.</p>

The defense informed the trial court that Dr. Woody would be “tied up in Center City Philadelphia” until after 5:00 p.m., and would come directly to the courtroom in Media. The defense requested that Dr. Woody be permitted to testify in the defense’s case-in-chief, offering Dr. Woody as the author of the section in the DSM-4 dealing with cocaine and psychotic disorders, and as a psychiatrist and an expert in the effect of controlled substances, i.e., cocaine, on an individual’s brain. The prosecution objected that Dr. Woody’s proffered testimony would be cumulative of Dr. Berman’s testimony concerning the DSM-4 and the effects of cocaine on Appellant. The trial judge sustained the prosecution’s objection, and the defense reluctantly rested its case.</p>

Dr. Cohn testified that cocaine-induced psychosis is dosage dependent, in that the amount of cocaine ingested by an individual and entering the individual’s blood stream is an important consideration as to whether a toxic psychosis would be produced. Dr. Cohn further testified that with a chronic cocaine user, it would take a higher dosage for him to be able to opine that the level would be consistent with a toxic psychosis. Dr. Cohn testified that, in view of the levels of cocaine and cocaine metabolites found in the victim’s blood and urine, and, assuming that Appellant had consumed the same amount of cocaine as had the victim, it was impossible to conclude that Appellant had suffered a cocaine-induced toxic psychosis at the time of the killing. Additionally, Dr. Cohn opined that Appellant was not suffering from toxic psychosis at the time of the killing <a id="p1091" href="#p1091" data-label="1091" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1091</a>because he retained Ms physical abilities and recalled the events surrounding the killing with clarity. Dr. Cohn further opined that Appellant’s specific intent to kill the victim was not affected by Ms ingestion of cocaine. Dr. Cohn testified on cross-examination that he was not familiar with the DSM-4, mainly because he is not a psycMatrist.</p>

The defense’s offer of proof for Dr. Woody’s testimony on direct was that he would testify as to the state of scientific literature, with regard to the correlation of dosage of cocaine with psychotic behavior, and the diagnostic criteria for individuals suffering from the psychotic effects of cocaine. The prosecution objected on the ground that Dr. Woody’s testimony as to the psycMatric effect of cocaine ingestion would be cumulative to Dr. Berman’s testimony. The trial court sustained the prosecution’s objection.</p>

Dr. Berman’s testimony on cross-examination also was clear that as a psychiatrist, his opinion that Appellant suffered from a toxic psychosis at the time of the killing was not affected by Appellant’s ability to recall with clarity his physical and mental activities at the time of the killing, because he believed Appellant would have been unable to “turn off" his body’s response to the effect of the cocaine on his system.</p>

    <p id="b1161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1161.5",1161,[186,362,753,1040]]]'>I believe it was erroneous to reject Dr. Woody’s testimony when it was offered to rebut the testimony of Dr. Cohn. Dr. Cohn was not a psychiatrist but a forensic toxicologist. His expertise was in relating quantitative dosages of drugs and alcohol to their effects on the human body. Dr. Woody’s testimony would have directly refuted Dr. Cohn’s contention that a correlation exists between cocaine levels and toxic psychosis. Dr. Woody would also have testified that the psychotic disorder induced by cocaine would not manifest itself in any physical manner. This would have been a direct contradiction of Dr. Cohn’s statement that appellant’s lack of physical impairment was a basis for concluding that he did not suffer from toxic psychosis. Thus Dr. Woody, appellant’s psychiatric expert, would have testified that the testimony of Dr. Cohn, the Commonwealth’s expert, was arguably incorrect in terms of the state of scientific knowledge in the field.</p>

The proffered testimony of Dr. Woody had a direct bearing on that issue. The significance of the issue was manifested by a question sent out by the jury during its deliberations: “Did Dr. Cohn say a toxic psychosis could have been possible in Wayne Smith’s case?” The question struck directly to the heart of the issue of appellant’s level of culpability in the murder. In this trial there was no dispute that toxic psychosis would negate the ability to form a specific intent to kill; the only debate was whether or not appellant was suffering toxic psychosis at the time of the killing. The information which Dr. Woody should have been permitted to present in surrebuttal was crucial to appellant’s defense and integral to the concerns of the jury reflected in the question submitted during deliberations.</p>
