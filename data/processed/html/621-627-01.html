The Board on Professional Responsibility found respondent had neglected a legal matter entrusted to him, DR 6 — 101(A)(3), had intentionally failed to seek a client’s lawful objectives, DR V — 101(A)(1), and had engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation, DR 1-102(A)(4). Respondent offered medical evidence of his chronic depression and, at the hearing before the Hearing Committee, consented to a two-year period of probation. When the matter came before the Board, a majority found a causal nexus between respondent’s depression and his professional misconduct and recommended four months’ suspension from practice, with two months of suspension stayed on condition that respondent comply with the terms of a two-year supervised probation. Respondent filed no objection to this recommendation. A minority of the Board, however, found no causal nexus between respondent’s depression and his misconduct and, accordingly, recommended the full four-month suspension without a stay, followed by a two-year period of supervised probation. We adopt the findings of the Board majority as well as the disposition it recommends.</p>

Complainant had filed a complaint with the Metropolitan Police Department alleging that, on March 8, 1978, she had been forcibly abducted from a common area of her apartment building, dragged into an adjacent, unlocked, abandoned laundry room, and forcibly raped. Three years later on March 7, 1981, the last day before the statute of limitations for bringing the civil suit expired, respondent filed a complaint in Superior Court. Summonses were issued for three defendants. The first two defendants were served promptly and.; answered the complaint. The third defendant was never served, however, and did not answer.</p>

There, the Board recommended, and we imposed, a thirty-day suspension.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In the present case, however, the Board reasoned that, because of the added element of misrepresentation involved, respondent’s transgressions warranted a stiffer penalty than the thirty days assessed in <em>Dory. </em>The misrepresentation in this case did not appear as extreme to the Board as the misrepresentation at issue in <em>In re Reback, </em><a href="/a2d/513/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="513 A.2d 226" data-case-ids="7926254" data-case-paths="/a2d/513/0226-01">513 A.2d 226</a> (D.C.1986) (en banc), where we imposed a six-month suspension for counsel’s attempt to cover up neglect by forging the client’s name on a substitute complaint and then lying about the signature in order to have the forged complaint notarized.

All nine members agreed that diagnosable chronic depression could be a mitigating factor if expert testimony demonstrated a causal relationship between the depression and the ethical default. A Board majority found that causal nexus here; two members did not. As a consequence, the Board majority accepted respondent’s depression as a mitigating factor, recommending that we stay two of the four months of suspension and impose a two-year period of probation along the lines proposed by respondent’s counsel, by Bar Counsel, by Drs.

In accepting the proposal for probation, therefore, the Board majority identified five factors<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> in the record which, in its view, “can serve as a legal surrogate of a specific finding under the <em>Kersey </em>‘but for’ test of causation for purposes of imposing a period of probation in lieu of all or part of the suspension that the misconduct would otherwise warrant.” The majority expressed a concern, however, that by tacking probation onto a period of suspension, the Hearing Committee essentially had treated evidence of respondent’s medical condition — introduced in mitigation — as an aggravating factor instead, using probation <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>as an additional, not lesser, sanction. The majority, therefore, sought to achieve mitigation, despite the lengthy probation, by recommending a stay of two of the four months of suspension provided the latter two months of suspension would be reinstated if respondent violated his probation. The majority recognized that “the proposed sanction of two months’ actual suspension plus two years of probation may be viewed by many attorneys ... as a more onerous sanction than four months’ suspension without probation,” but the majority premised this recommendation on the fact that “both Bar Counsel and respondent have consented to the recommended bifurcated sanction.” Neither respondent nor Bar Counsel filed any exception to the Board majority’s recommendation.</p>

The minority acknowledged, however, that there was record evidence that respondent “has and continues to suffer from emotional problems, and that such problems have <em>potential </em>to affect his law practice.” (Emphasis added.)

Both therapists who offered evidence agreed that respondent suffers from chronic depression. Furthermore, there appears to be no dispute that respondent experienced a particularly acute period of depression during the time in question. Respondent’s letter of April 7, 1986, to his neglected client attributed his delay in her case to personal problems. More significantly, the record contains a letter from respondent’s psychiatrist offering her professional opinion that respondent’s acutely depressed state caused his professional neglect.</p>
    <p id="b691-6" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[199,1479,742,796]]]'>It would have been better if the psychiatric testimony had been live and subject to cross-examination and to examination by a Hearing Committee that addressed the causal nexus issue. As it turned out, the Board had to engage in fact-finding, and not all members of the Board were satisfied that the letters from the psychiatrists were convincing on the crucial question of causation. Nonetheless, given the fact that respondent, Bar Counsel, and a majority of the Board were satisfied with the proffered psychiatric testimony, we are comfortable — in this particular case — with the proof presented. Other cases, however, may not be uncontroverted and thus may require more substantial proof.</p>

The question, then, is how, if at all, a lengthy period of probation can properly be used to reflect mitigation (in contrast with enhancement) of sanction for a disciplinary violation.</p>

If a causal .connection is not shown, depression that is insufficient for mitigation cannot be sufficient for a sanction, such as probation, imposed in addition to the maximum sanction that otherwise would be warranted. For this reason, the Board minority’s recommendation — the four-month suspension required for the misconduct <em>plus </em>a two-year, supervised probation based merely on the “potential” <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>impact of respondent’s depression on his practice of law — is unacceptable.</p>
