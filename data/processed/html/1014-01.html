Agurs, </em><a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">427 U.S. 97</a>, <a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">96 S.Ct. 2392</a>, <a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">49 L.Ed.2d 342</a> (1976); and (2) the inconsistencies and post trial recantations of the witnesses’ inculpatory trial testimony were sufficient for the Trial Judge to have been “reasonably well-satisfied” that prejudicial perjury was committed requiring a new trial.</p>

At the time of giving the written statement, however, Cotton, under interrogation orally implicated defendant in the rape case. At trial Cotton testified that defendant had made certain admissions to him concerning the rape, but further testified that he had made no statement to the police regarding the rape. The Trial Judge found as fact that Cotton ‘equated the term “statement” with a written document.’ The Trial Judge further found that Cotton’s statement was only marginally relevant to his trial testimony; that its value for impeachment purposes was extremely limited and readily explainable; that its production would not have assisted the defense and clearly its absence did not raise an issue of reasonable <a id="p1015" href="#p1015" data-label="1015" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1015</a>doubt because of the victim’s positive in-court identification of defendant to secure the written statement for impeachment purposes was of little significance in the total quantum of trial evidence.</p>
