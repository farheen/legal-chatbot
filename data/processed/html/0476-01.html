Brown were married in 1988 in Florida and moved to Maine in 1993. They bought a small house in Mariaville. Daniel and Faith have one child together, a daughter born in 2001. The parties separated in 2004, and Daniel brought a complaint for divorce in January 2005 alleging irreconcilable differences. The parties stipulated to shared parental rights and responsibilities, but disputed primary residence, visitation and contact, and all financial issues.</p>
    <p id="b526-14" data-blocks='[["BL_526.14",526,[1007,613,750,452]]]'>[¶ 3] After a one-day hearing, the court issued a divorce judgment in April 2006 that was amended in May 2006 in response to Faith’s motion for further findings pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 52(b). The judgment awarded shared parental rights and responsibilities, with the parties sharing the child’s residential care in accordance with a schedule adopted by the court.</p>
    <p id="b526-15" data-blocks='[["BL_526.15",526,[1003,1090,754,768]]]'>[¶ 4] The court awarded the parties’ Ma-riaville home, which it valued at $65,000, to Faith, subject to a mortgage with an outstanding balance of $16,457 and a home equity loan with an outstanding balance of $14,095. It ordered Faith to pursue all reasonable efforts to sell the house and discharge the mortgage and home equity loans. Daniel was ordered to maintain the mortgage, home equity loan, and house insurance payments through July 2006, after which Faith was ordered to pay those expenses and hold Daniel harmless. The court also ordered Daniel to pay the outstanding real estate taxes on the property.</p>

That sale would not involve broker’s costs.” The court estimated that the equity in the house was in the range of $30,000-$35,000, and it adopted $30,000 as the approximate amount that could be expected from the sale of the home after the payment of the mortgage loan and home equity loan. The judgment then accounted for and awarded the anticipated $30,000 in proceeds so that $20,000 would pay for Faith’s medical, legal, and other debts, and the remaining <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>$10,000 would serve as a lump sum spousal support award to Faith.

    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[195,1348,758,1133]]]'>[¶ 12] Daniel testified that at the time of the divorce hearing, he was earning $11.25 an hour and working twenty-five hours per week and that his income potential was $30,000-$32,000, but that he was not presently making that amount. He also testified that the last year that he and Faith were together, he made over $50,000 because he frequently worked double and triple shifts so that Faith could stay home with their daughter. The court found that Daniel’s departure from that job did not result in voluntary underemployment because the hours of work and travel were difficult, and interfered with a reasonable family life. The court arrived at Daniel’s imputed income by finding that Daniel was voluntarily underemployed by working twenty-five hours per week and assuming that he could work forty hours per week at $12 per hour for fifty-two weeks per year, and rounding up.</p>
    <p id="b528-8" data-blocks='[["BL_528.8",528,[1003,248,756,1140]]]'>[¶ 13] The court’s finding that Daniel’s imputed income was $12 an hour was not clearly erroneous because the rate was comparable with Daniel’s skill set and work history. Because Daniel was employed only twenty-five hours a week at the time of the divorce hearing and had the ability to work more hours, the court did not commit clear error in finding that Daniel was voluntarily underemployed, and could work up to forty hours per week. Contrary to Faith’s contention that Daniel’s imputed income should be at least $50,000 based on his previous employment, the court acted within its discretion in considering Daniel’s testimony that to earn $50,000 he had to work frequent double and triple shifts that interfered with his ability to spend reasonable time with his daughter. The court did not err in imputing Daniel’s income at $12 an hour for a forty-hour work week.</p>

Pursuant to 19-A M.R.S. § 2001(5)(D) (2006), a court may impute income when a party voluntarily becomes or remains unemployed or underemployed. Contrary to Faith’s contentions, the court did not commit clear error in finding that once Faith obtained reasonable transportation, income could be imputed to her at $15,000. <em>See Carolan, </em><a href="/a2d/916/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2007 ME 39" data-case-ids="8336414" data-case-paths="/a2d/916/0945-01">2007 ME 39</a>, ¶ 12, <a href="/a2d/916/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2007 ME 39" data-case-ids="8336414" data-case-paths="/a2d/916/0945-01">916 A.2d at 948</a>.

Incongruously, as ultimately amended, the judgment imputes income to Faith effective immediately. Because the court found that Faith would not be able to work until she obtained transportation, her imputed income should not have been deemed available to her prior to when she could reasonably be expected to obtain transportation. Accordingly, the court’s finding that Faith’s imputed income of $15,000 was available to her upon the entry of the divorce judgment was clearly erroneous.</p>

It also ordered Daniel to pay the home mortgage, home equity loan, and insurance through July 2006. The court’s rationale for providing no more than three months of transitional support was its finding that the sale of the marital home “was anticipated within a 90 day period, since a potential buyer was already identified.” The court also found that once the home is sold, there will be sufficient net proceeds for Faith to receive an approximately $10,000 lump sum spousal support award.</p>
    <p id="b529-9" data-blocks='[["BL_529.10",529,[963,372,757,1127]]]'>[¶ 18] The only evidence regarding the value of the marital home and when it might be sold was Daniel’s testimony that two neighbors had previously expressed interest in purchasing the home for $65,000. In testifying about his opinion as to the value of the home, Daniel stated that “I don’t have a realtor quote or anything, but I spoke to two of our neighbors in the area at the time that offered to buy it for sixty-five thousand dollars.” Daniel’s testimony did not address when the offer was made, whether the offer was conditional in any respect, and whether the offer remained current. Accordingly, there is no record support for the proposition that the neighbors remain able and willing to purchase the home within ninety days of the divorce judgment. The court’s finding that the home would sell within ninety days and without the assistance of a real estate broker is clear error.</p>
    <p id="b529-10" data-blocks='[["BL_529.11",529,[965,1533,757,1122]]]'>[¶ 19] Until the home is sold, the judgment anticipates that Faith’s income will consist of public assistance, food stamps, child support in the amount of $52 per week, transitional spousal support in the amount of $31 per week for a period of no more than ninety days, and transitional support in the form of Daniel’s payment of the house related expenses for no more than three months. In addition, the court’s division of the proceeds from the sale of the home and its award of $10,000 in lump sum spousal support were predicated on the court’s finding that the house would be sold to the neighbors within ninety days without a broker. Absent evidence in the record that the home could reasonably be expected to be sold by the end of July 2006, we conclude that the court abused its discretion by terminating the transitional spousal support in July 2006.</p>
