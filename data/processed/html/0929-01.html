We must first decide whether the judge may require the contemnor to pay the aggrieved party’s counsel fees in the absence of a finding that the contemptuous conduct was willful. If the judge has the authority to make an award of counsel fees under such circumstances, then we must also decide whether he may limit the award to a token sum because the fees would be paid from the public fisc and because the aggrieved party was represented without charge by a nonprofit legal services organization.

Link, a public housing tenant, alleging nonpayment of rent. Ms. Link, represented by attorneys from the Neighborhood Legal Services Program, filed an answer and counterclaim in which she alleged the existence of substantial Housing Code violations. Negotiations ensued and, on April 20, 1992, the parties executed a settlement agreement which required the District, among other things, to make specified repairs in Ms. Link’s apartment and to issue a check in Ms. Link’s favor in the amount of $800, that sum representing one-third of the rent which Ms. Link had paid over the past three years. The repairs were to be completed in thirty days, except that the time limit was extended to ninety days for certain structural repairs. The cheek was to be issued within a reasonable time.</p>

The District did not comply with the court’s order and, on March 25, 1993, following an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge held the District in civil contempt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Five days later, the judge issued a written order in which he required the District to make the remaining repairs by a specified date, directed the District to pay an additional $115 in filing fees and interest, and awarded Ms. Link $100 in counsel fees.

We note that awards of counsel fees in civil contempt cases are designed to make the injured party whole, and not to punish the contemnor. Punishment is imposed by resort to the criminal contempt power. <em>D.D. v.

Ms. Link asks us to direct the trial court to utilize the ''lodestar” approach — "the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate,” <em>Motley, <a href="/f-supp/664/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="664 F.

Chief Judge Robinson applied the lodestar in fixing the fee for the Neighborhood Legal Service Program attorney in <em>Motley, </em>and this would doubtless be a reasonable approach in this case too. We are not prepared to hold, however, in advance of the exercise of the trial judge's discretion on remand, that no other resolution of the issue would be equitable. <em>See King v.
