In his application, Dr. Yavit observed that Cade had discharged himself from the Hospital against medical advice in February of that year, and subsequently refused to admit himself voluntarily. The application revealed that Cade had difficulty controlling his behavior, noting that on the previous day he broke the front door of <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>his mother’s home, threatened a relative with a knife, then suffered a broken arm and cut his mother when she tried to wrest the knife from him.

Subsequently, the Commission on Mental Health (Commission) conducted hearings, finding Cade and Richardson to be mentally ill and, as a result of their illnesses, likely to injure themselves or others. The Commission noted that Cade had been admitted to the Hospital on six occasions and was presently experiencing hallucinations and paranoid delusions that others wanted to harm him. In Richardson’s case, the Commission observed that he had recently signed out of the Hospital against medical advice, and “eloped” from the institution numerous times in the past. The Commission added that without medication and appropriate treatment, Richardson’s condition would deteriorate, yet noted that “he has been hostile about taking his medication which has required [that he] be placed in seclusion.” The Commission concluded that the conditions of both men had been sufficiently stabilized to permit their return to the community, provided that each take his medication and abide by his treatment regimen.</p>

The court accepted the recommendation and entered final orders committing both men to outpatient treatment programs. Pursuant to the Hospital’s request, the court incorporated into both commitment orders a provision authorizing the Hospital to return the patient summarily to the institution for no more than five days in the event his condition deteriorates or he fails to comply with the outpatient therapy program. The orders further provided that should the Hospital seek to detain the patient beyond the five-day period, it must petition the court to commit him for an indeterminate period of institutionalization; otherwise, he must be returned to the outpatient program.</p>

    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[194,531,754,794]]]'>On October 1,1981, Carlton Ellerbee was admitted to the Hospital as an emergency patient after being subdued by police officers in his home where he had threatened to kill several members of his family. After a period of emergency observation and diagnosis, the Hospital filed a petition for Ellerbee’s involuntary hospitalization. The Commission issued its report, noting that Ellerbee had been admitted to the Hospital on five previous occasions and had failed in the past to take his medication or comply with the outpatient therapy program. The Commission recommended that Ellerbee remain an inpatient at the Hospital until placement in a supervised residential facility could be arranged.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[190,1346,753,986]],["BL_538.6",538,[993,276,753,1415]]]'>Ellerbee appeared before the court, waived trial and accepted the Commission’s recommendation. The court determined that the least restrictive course of treatment for Ellerbee was indeterminate commitment to the Hospital, provided that he be released into the community as an outpatient once a suitable residential facility could be located. The court then issued a final order of commitment in accordance with its determination. The Hospital had requested the court to include in the final commitment order a provision similar to those incorporated into the Cade and Richardson orders authorizing Ellerbee’s temporary return to the Hospital in the event of deterioration or noncomplianee with the treatment plan. The court denied the request, concluding that it was without discretion to include the temporary return provision. The court ruled that should the Hospital seek Ellerbee’s temporary return to inpatient care it must adhere to certain procedures which the court concluded were mandated by due process and the least restrictive alternative doctrine embodied in the Act. These procedures require that where the Hospital determines the patient is likely to injure himself or others as a result of his mental illness unless immediately rehospitalized, it must file with the court an affidavit setting forth sufficient information to permit the court to find probable cause justifying the proposed temporary detention. The court is then to determine within twenty-four hours whether the patient should be returned to the Hospital for a period not to exceed five days. As in the Cade and Richardson orders, the court provided that if Ellerbee is returned, the Hospital must either release him after the fifth day or commence proceedings before the court seeking his indefinite return to inpatient care. Where the Hospital is unable to demonstrate that El-lerbee is in need of emergency rehospitali-zation, he may not be returned to inpatient care, even for a temporary period, until a judicial hearing is held and the court determines that the temporary detention is justified.</p>

The prospect of error is somewhat enhanced by the possibility that in certain instances, the friends or relatives of an outpatient may seek his return to the institution because they feel uncomfortable in his presence or are dissatisfied with the progress he is making toward rehabilitation. In order to assure that the court is fully afforded an opportunity to determine that the temporary return is appropriate, and not motivated by concerns incompatible with the goals of the Act, we conclude that the Superintendent of the Hospital must provide the court with an affidavit within twenty-four hours of the patient’s return to the institution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The affiant must recite the recent actions of the patient and the reasons for his return in sufficient detail, enabling the court to make a prompt, <em>ex parte </em>determination that the patient has failed to abide his treatment regimen or has suffered a deterioration in his condition.

Although the patient has an interest in not being erroneously deprived of his freedom to remain in the community under the terms of the commitment order, he will not be as free as other citizens while undergoing outpatient therapy. The outpatient will be compelled to participate in a prescribed course of treatment and must abide severe restraints governing his freedom of movement. Similarly, as he lives a “controlled experiment with freedom,” his actions will be scrutinized and evaluated by psychiatrists, family and the court.

We conclude that the Act does not compel the use of these contrasting procedures. Although a deteriorating or uncooperative patient may not yet need emergency treatment, it is likely that unless returned immediately, his condition will deteriorate further and he will be required eventually to spend more time under inpatient care than if the Hospital had been permitted to return him for a short period of stabilization the moment his perceptions or condition deteriorate. Such a result is hardly consistent with "the best interests of the <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>person or the public.” D.C.Code § 21-545(b) (1981). <em>See In re Williams, </em><a href="/a2d/471/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="471 A.2d 263" data-case-ids="7958174" data-case-paths="/a2d/471/0263-01">471 A.2d 263</a>, 267 n. 7 (D.C.1984).</p>

Where the patient has failed to participate in the outpatient program for an extended period, a hearing preceding his hospitalization will be an empty exercise since the Hospital authorities will have had no opportunity to examine him prior to the hearing. Clearly, in order for the Hospital to determine that a temporary return is appropriate, the staff must be accorded a sufficient opportunity to observe the patient’s present condition.</p>
