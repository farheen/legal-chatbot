According to Ban-der, he chose the Fisher law firm because it specialized in FCC matters. Over a two-month period, the law firm, in Washington, prepared an application for transfer of the broadcast license and tangible assets of the station, obtained the required FCC approval, drafted a contract of sale, and mailed that contract to North Carolina where it was signed by the parties to the sale. The contract was returned to the law firm’s office in the District of Columbia, and on March 30, 1983, Bander and the purchaser of the station met at the law office and signed the remaining documents to close the sale. According to Bander, this trip to attend the formal closing was his only visit to Washington, D.C. in connection with the WRZR matter. The law firm maintains that Bander visited its office in Washington on several other occasions to check on the status of the transfer application before the FCC.</p>
