This evidence, as well as the ALJ’s unchallenged findings of fact, documents the following regarding petitioner’s resources. First, petitioner’s husband, Michael, executed a trust agreement in 1969 in connection with his will. The trust agreement created two funds, A and B, which were established with the proceeds of Michael’s estate. When Michael died in 1981, his gross estate totaled $558,088.43. Following Michael’s death, $118,449.43 was put into Fund A and $178,749.70 was put into Fund B.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The <a id="p1221" href="#p1221" data-label="1221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1221</a>trust agreement named the three DeBone children as trustees and petitioner as the only life beneficiary.</p>
    <p id="b1269-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1269.7",1269,[165,415,752,1159]]]'>The trust agreement provides that, during petitioner’s lifetime, all of the yearly net income from Fund A is to be paid to petitioner or for her benefit. In addition, petitioner is authorized to request sums from the principal of Fund A, even to exhaustion of the trust. If petitioner is incapable of requesting amounts from the principal, the trustees are authorized in their discretion to disburse to petitioner for her benefit such sums as they deem advisable for “health, maintenance and support” or for any other purpose deemed to be in her best interest. Moreover, if petitioner fails to exhaust Fund A during her lifetime, any remaining sums could be transferred under her will. Finally, the trust agreement provides that neither the income nor the principal of Fund A could be used to satisfy petitioner’s debts or be attached by petitioner’s creditors. At the time of petitioner’s application for benefits, Fund A had been depleted.</p>

In addition, the trustees are directed “to distribute to or for the benefit of the Insured’s wife, so much of the principal as the Trustees, in their sole discretion, deem advisable for her health, maintenance and support.” <em>See </em>Trust Agreement, ¶ B-l, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 8a. The trust agreement further provides that: “Following the death of the Insured’s wife during the continuance of this Trust <em>created for her benefit, </em>or upon the death of the Insured in the event the Insured’s wife fails to survive him, the principal of Fund ‘B’ as it is then constituted,” shall be divided into three equal shares and distributed to the Insured’s children, one share each. <em>Id., </em>¶ B-2, R.R. at 9a (emphasis added).

It appears that Fund B also included a Wachovia Securities account with a balance of approximately $24,000 as of November 2005. In addition, petitioner had a checking account in her name with a balance of at least $11,000, as well as a variable annuity with a value of at least $1,200. Finally, petitioner’s burial reserve exceeded the allowable limit by approximately $750.00. According to the ALJ’s decision, petitioner conceded that her checking account, variable annuity and excess burial reserve must be used for nursing home care and considered in determining her eligibility for MA. However, petitioner argued that the trust fund (Fund B) should not be considered a resource available to her.</p>

Accordingly, since the total resources available to petitioner far exceeded the $2,400 limit, the ALJ denied petitioner’s appeal. The Department affirmed, and the present appeal followed.</p>

According to petitioner, the language of the trust indicates that the settlor did not intend for her to have the ability to invade the principal of Fund B, which is clearly intended for the exclusive benefit of the settlor’s children. In support of this argument, petitioner notes the differences between her access to Fund A and B, as well as the different spendthrift provisions pertaining to each fund. Finally, petitioner implies that limiting the trustees’ discretion to invade the principal of Fund B for her “health, maintenance and support,” does not demonstrate that the settlor intended the principal to be used for nursing home care. Petitioner maintains that if the settlor intended Fund B to be a resource available for nursing home care, he would have authorized disbursement for “medical, dental, hospital and nursing home expenses and other expenses of invalidism.” Petitioner’s appellate brief at 13.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
