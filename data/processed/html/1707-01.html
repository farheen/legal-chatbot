    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[276,908,1103,1160]]]'>The first count charges that at the time of plaintiff’s injury Williams and Patterson “were and still are” the joint trustees of Weaver’s Lakeland Steam Laundry, describing its location, which laundry was during his lifetime owned and operated by Reed W. Weaver, “who in the codicil of his last will and testament appointed said defendants joint trustees and empowered them to have exclusive charge of the operation, management and control of said laundry;” that said codicil and will have been duly proven and admitted to probate, as the same appears of record, and that said defendants were operating said laundry on the date of plaintiff’s injury, October 25, 1926. The count then goes on to charge the defendants with certain alleged negligence causing plaintiff’s injury. The second count begins by charging that the defendants on October 25, 1926, “as joint trustees of the estate of Weaver’s Lakeland Steam Laundry, were operating said laundry located in the City of Lakeland, County of Polk and State of Florida,” and that’ in such operation they were guilty of certain negligence causing plaintiff’s injury.

It appears from page 22 of the transcript that on April 10, 1928, there was filed in said cause a “suggestion as to the resignation of trustees by John W. Patterson, Jr., and Bradford G. Williams, and as to the appointment of one Kenneth Smith as the successor to said trust.” Then follows this entry: “On the 28th day of May, 1928, pursuant to suggestion as to resignation of trustees as aforesaid, the plaintiff filed in said cause motion to amend all pleadings by substituting therein Kenneth Smith as trustee for Weaver’s Lakeland Steam Laundry for the names of the former trustees, John W. Patterson, Jr. and Bradford G. Williams. On the 2nd day óf June, 1928, after due notice of the motion aforesaid, an order was entered in said cause striking out the names of John W.

Williams, as joint trustees of Weaver’s Lakeland Steam Laundry, and substituting therefor the name of Kenneth Smith, as trustee for Weaver’s Lakeland Steam Laundry.”</p>

We refer to the fact that the declaration as thus amended had the effect of making counts one and two 'charge the negligence therein alleged as having been the negligence of Kenneth Smith as trustee,, instead of by his predecessors in the trust, in the - course of the operation of said laundry, as charged in the original amended declaration filed in November, 1927. Now it is most likely that Williams and Patterson did not resign as trustees until long after the plaintiff was injured, but the' suggestion, motion to amend the order of the court as shown by the record does not expressly show when they resigned, nor when Kenneth Smith was appointed, nor by whom, nor' upon what authority he was appointed. No objection, however, was made to the motion or 'to the granting of the ■ order substituting the name of Kenneth Smith as trustee in the place of Williams and Patterson. The order as made was in general terms, and rather indefinite, but construed in the light of the motion, it was evidently intended to apply to ‘ ‘ all pleadings. ’ ’ This would have made counts one and two, on which the case was tried and judgment rendered, charge that Smith as trustee was empowered and authorized under the will of Reed W. Weaver to operate, and was operating, the laundry at the time of plaintiff’s injury, and was therefore guilty of and chargeable with the negligence alleged.</p>

The presumption might well be that if negligence was shown, the responsibility would rest upon the person in control of and operating the laundry, whoever it might, be, or in whatever capacity he was operating it. But in the absence of evidence, would the jury have been warranted in finding that such person was Kenneth Smith and that he was operating said laundry as trustee at the time of plaintiff’s injury, under the trusteeship created by the will of Reed W.

The declaration charged that one Hicks was the special agent, servant or employee of the defendant railway company, vested with the duty and authority to prevent trespassers from stealing rides on the company’s freight train, and that Hicks, while acting within the scope of his authority, sought to eject Fox, a trespasser, from the moving train, and, while doing so, shot and killed him, or wantonly and wilfully caused him to fall to the ground, or shot him to prevent his reentering the train, thus causing his death. Thus the declaration charged a wilful or intentional act on the part of Hicks, amounting to either murder or manslaughter, and, as pointed out in the opinion, the defendant’s liability, if any, depended upon allegation and proof of Hicks’ agency; that is, that at the time he killed Fox, Hicks was the agent of the defendant, and was acting within the scope of his authority as such agent. Thus in that case, the agency of Hicks was of the gist of <a id="p1717" href="#p1717" data-label="1717" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1717</a>the ease. The holding there very properly was, as above pointed out, that, under such a declaration, the plea of the general issue did not admit such agency. The effect of the statute was to reverse this ruling so far as future cases were concerned, by providing in effect that in cases where the declaration alleges that the breach of duty or wrongful act was committed by the defendant through ‘ ‘ the agency of any other person or thing,” the plea of not guilty would admit “the alleged relationship,” that is the agency, between the defendant and such other person “or thing.” Just what the legislature meant by the agency of a “thing” is not quite clear. A “thing” may constitute an instrumentality, but neither in legal meaning nor in common parlance is it ordinarily understood that a thing, an inanimate object, may act as an agent. But whatever may have been the meaning of this word as used in the statute, it is quite clear that the declaration in this case is not within the operation of the statutory amendment to rule 71, for it nowhere alleges that the breach.of duty or wrongful act complained of was ‘ ‘ committed by defendant through the agency of any other person or thing. ’ ’ The gist of the charge made in the declaration is that the injury complained of was caused by a negligent failure on the part of the defendant to perform certain non-delegable duties of the master, such as the failure to provide the plaintiff employee with a reasonably safe place in which to work; or, more specifically speaking, the failure of the defendant to keep a guard or other protecting device over or around the upper part of a dangerous and rapidly revolving piece of machinery, by which machine it was necessary for plaintiff to pass in the course of his duty and employment, and into which plaintiff, slipping upon the slick and soapy floor of the laundry, fell and was injured. The declaration also charged that the defendant was negligent <a id="p1718" href="#p1718" data-label="1718" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1718</a>in failing to warn plaintiff, an eighteen year old boy who had but shortly before entered his .employment, of the dangerous character of the machine when thus left uncovered. So neither the statutory amendment to rule 71, nor the principle enunciated in the Varnes case, have any application to the case at bar. Here we have a case alleging merely simple negligence, all of which is charged directly against the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b714-5" data-blocks='[["BL_714.5",714,[291,994,1110,1162]]]'>At common law the' rule was that the plea of the general issue puts in issue all the material allegations of the complaint or declaration.

As usually the only contention between the parties in actions of tort was whether or not the breach of duty or wrongful act alleged to have been committed by the defendant amounted in law to a breach of duty or wrongful act, and whether it had in fact been committed as alleged, the common law rule was a cumbersome one in actual practice and required the introduction of much unnecessary evidence by the plaintiff to prove allegations in the nature of .inducement which were not really in dispute. So the eommon law requirement was changed by the rules of pleading adopted at Trinity Term, 1853, which rules- liad the force of an act of Parliament. Rule 71 of our Circuit Court rulés, adopted by this Court in June, 1873, is an exact copy of the English Trinity Term rule on that subject, and has in operation greatly simplified and facilitated the administration of justice. See the Crosby case, <em>supra. </em>It is one of the many illustrations of the value of leaving the rule-making power in the hands of the courts.</p>

Thus in the Crosby ease, it was held that in an action against a railroad company for damages for personal injuries received by the plaintiff while a passenger on one of its trains caused by the negligence of the defendant in backing a locomotive against such train, the allegation in the declaration that the plaintiff was a passenger was matter of inducement which was not denied by the-plea of not guilty, and no proof of such relation was necessary in the absence of any special plea denying such relationship.

Be that as it may, after due consideration of plaintiff in error’s argument to the contrary, we do not think that either the declaration or the evidence shows any assumption by the plaintiff of the risk created by leaving the dangerous extractor machine uncovered. The doctrine has long obtained in this jurisdiction, as in many others, that as a general rule the servant will not be held to have assumed risks resulting from the master’s negligence.

This was correct. While the general rule is that the trust estate is not liable for the <em>torts </em>of the trustee, as the law will not allow a trust estate to be impaired by the negligence or improvidence of the trustee, this rule is subject to exceptions. Thus where an active trust is created and the trustee is charged with the duty of carrying on a business, the trust estate may be held liable for the negligence of the trustee or his employees, unless there be some limitation to the contrary imposed by statute or by the instrument creating the trust. 26 R.
