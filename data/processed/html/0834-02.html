Barton owns and operates Maine Avenue Seafood, Inc., in a building owned by the federal government and managed by the District of Columbia. In November of 1999, the District of Columbia sued Barton for possession in landlord-tenant court when he failed to vacate the premises after the District canceled his month-to-month lease. ■ Barton claims that .the trial court erred in not recognizing that the District of Columbia Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1999 contained language which entitled him to a new thirty-year lease. He further contends that the trial court’s decision violated his rights to due process and equal protection of the laws. We hold that Barton is not entitled to a thirty-year lease, but we also hold that the trial court erred when it failed to consider his due process and equal protection claims. Accordingly, we remand the case for further proceedings.</p>

Negotiations over the lease and improvements to the fish market building continued for several months. Meanwhile, in July 1999, the DHCD and the Army Corps of Engineers completed their study of the area and concluded that the fish market building was in poor condition and was “also poorly located on the site and interrupts traffic patterns.” The study reviewed four proposed action plans, one of which included demolishing the building and replacing it with a new one.

The District moved for summary judgment, arguing that Barton’s defenses were beyond the scope of those allowed by the Landlord and Tenant Rules.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Barton opposed the summary judgment motion and filed his own action against the District in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Barton also moved in the Superior Court to stay the landlord-tenant case in light of his related complaint in federal court.

    <p id="b881-10" data-blocks='[["BL_881.11",881,[942,1031,754,1236]]]'>Furthermore, the plain language of the 1999 Appropriation Act shows that no enforceable rights are being bestowed on the existing lessees. The statute imposes no affirmative duty on the District to execute any leases; rather, it makes the availability of appropriated funds contingent upon such action, which the District is free to take or not as it sees fit. No rights are created in third parties by such a provision. In the 2000 Appropriation Act, Congress retroactively amended the 1999 Appropriation Act by changing the term “existing lessees” to “existing lessees of the Marina.” <em>See </em>113 Stat. at 1529. The effect of this amendment was to remove the condition that the District negotiate long-term leases with those businesses operating in the fish market building. Because Barton leases space in the fish market building and not in the marina, the 2000 Appropriation Act repealed the only provision even arguably applicable to him.</p>

The implication seems to be that the District could not evict Barton without such authority because otherwise his use of the building was not inconsistent with development of the area.

Such a grant of authority necessarily includes the power to terminate leases in accordance with their terms.

He makes two arguments. First, he contends that the trial court should have stayed the instant landlord-tenant case pending the resolution of his related case in federal court, which included similar due process and equal protection claims. We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in not entering a stay. There is no legal barrier to the presentation of a claim simultaneously in more than one court, in parallel lawsuits. While a stay of one proceeding in favor of another may be appropriate in a particular case, on a proper showing, Barton has made no showing whatever of any reason why the present eviction proceeding should await the outcome of the related but different case filed in federal court.</p>

The District argues that Barton abandoned this contention on appeal because he never raised it in his brief. We note, however, in examining Barton’s brief, that the trial court’s failure to recognize his due process and equal protection claims is listed in the index as one of his eight arguments, is repeated in his “Statement of Issues Presented for Review,” is discussed—albeit very briefly, and without any citation of case law—in a section at the end of his brief headed “Constitutional Deprivation,” and finally is repeated in his “Conclusion.” We find this treatment adequate (perhaps barely) to preserve his due process and equal protection claims for appellate review.</p>

Landlord and Tenant Rule 5(b) allows a defendant to “assert an equitable defense of recoupment or set-off or a counterclaim for a money judgment based on the payment of rent or expenditures claimed as credits,” but it also states that “[n]o other counterclaims ... may be <a id="p841" href="#p841" data-label="841" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*841</a>filed in this Branch.” The trial judge considered Barton’s racial discrimination claim to be a counterclaim and thus barred by Rule 5(b). The record reveals, however, that Barton’s claim was presented as a defense, rather than a counterclaim, in both his answer to the District’s complaint and his opposition to the motion for summary judgment. “Notwithstanding Rule 5(b), a defendant always has the right to present any <em>legal </em>defense as part of a general denial of liability.” <em>Shin v.

In his federal complaint, Barton alleged, among other things, that the eviction was motivated by racial animus and that the 1999 Appropriation Act entitled him to a thirty-year lease. In January of 2001 he filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the United States District Court, seeking to prevent the District from entering into leases with the other fish wharf tenants. <em>See Barton </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/131/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="131 F.

The court denied the injunction, noting that there was no evidence that the District negotiated with Barton in bad faith and no evidence that Johnson was acting "under color of” state law when he made the alleged racial comment. <em><a href="/f-supp-2d/131/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="131 F.

As to the NEPA defense, the court ruled that Barton’s eviction was not a federal action ("Mr. Barton proffers no support for the notion that the actions taken by the District fall within the scope of ... NEPA”), and, in any event, that Barton did not have standing "to raise a violation of the statute, should there be one.”</p>

Furthermore, although Mr. Barton has not pressed the issue on appeal, we are satisfied that the trial court did not err in concluding that NEPA did not provide Barton with a defense to the eviction. Barton's eviction was not a federal action, and it had no impact on the environment.</p>
