The appellate division had affirmed the decision of a WCC trial judge to deny benefits to Roger Anderson (plaintiff) for injury sustained while in the employ of O’Connell Supply (defendanVemployer). Both parties were directed to show cause why the issues raised in the petition should not be summarily decided.</p>

    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[184,1060,757,611]]]'>The plaintiff sustained a permanent fifty-percent uncorrectable loss of vision in his left eye as a result of a work-related injury. The single issue presented is whether plaintiff is entitled to compensation pursuant to G.L. 1956 (1986 Reenactment) § 28-33-19 as a result of the injury. More specifically, pursuant to G.L.1956 (1986 Reenactment) § 28-33-19(a)(13) can the term “bodily member” be interpreted to include an eye, or does the statutory scheme clearly refer to the “stiffness or uselessness” of “bodily members” in the context of hands, feet, fingers or toes?</p>

The examining physician concluded, notwithstanding, that plaintiff’s total visual loss was at fifty percent. The appellate division conducted a de novo review, examining and weighing the evidence contained in the record, and found no error on the part of the trial judge.</p>
    <p id="b590-11" data-blocks='[["BL_590.13",590,[984,1754,753,885]]]'>We are of the opinion that the appellate division correctly applied the law in this case. The explicit statutory provisions that relate to losses of vision evidence a clear legislative intent to account for such losses under subsections (1) and (4) of § 28-33-19(a). The term “bodily member” is not defined in the statute and therefore “must be given [its] ordinary and customary meaning.” <em>R.I. Chamber of Commerce v.

Because the term bodily member is used in conjunction with the terms “severed” and “stiffness,” we conclude that subsection (13) cannot be applied to visual losses and does not provide the remedy that the plaintiff seeks.</p>
