As of that date, a petitioner’s right to alimony was foreclosed under 13 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 1512 and was confined to 13 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 1518(h) and certain limited amendments to § 1502 enacted in 1978. 61 <em>Del.Laws, </em>C. 204, effective January 24, 1978.</p>

The Court was clearly entitled to treat husband’s pension rights, whether vested or not, as “marital property” under 13 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 1513. <em>Robert C.S. v.

However, since we have found error in the Court’s award to wife of permanent alimony, the Court’s direction that the calculation of wife’s future alimony should take into consideration husband’s matured pension benefits necessarily falls.</p>
