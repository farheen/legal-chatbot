Genetin was a truck driver who suffered from medical problems which rendered him incapable of performing his regular duties. In enunciating what is required of an employee who elects to terminate employment for health reasons and wishes to maintain entitlement to unemployment compensation benefits, the Supreme Court held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b831-9" data-blocks='[["BL_831.9",831,[1032,357,715,1233]]]'>Where an employee because of a physical condition, can no longer perform his regular duties, he must be available for suitable work, consistent with the medical condition, to remain eligible for benefits. However, once he has communicated his medical problem to the employer and explained his inability to perform the regularly assigned duties, an employee can do no more. The availability of an employment position, the duties expected to be performed by one serving in that capacity, and the desirability of that individual for service in that capacity are managerial judgments over which the employee has no control. As <em>long as the employee is available where a reasonable accommodation is made by the employer, that is not inimica-ble to the health of the employee, the employee has demonstrated the good faith effort to maintain the employment relationship required under the </em>Act.... To insist upon the employee’s initiating the quest for an alternative position, would require a meaningless ritual that does not further the objectives of the Act.</blockquote>
