In May 1994, a twelve-year-old girl awoke in the Bridgton home she shared with her mother to the sound of her mother screaming repeatedly, “No!” in a loud, terrified voice. She heard a drawer opening in the kitchen, and knives clinking against each other, followed by “a highly repetitive thudding sound with a liquid component to it” and a male voice grunt heavily at the end; she then heard the sound of the phone off the hook. Eventually she left her bedroom and caught sight of her mother’s body on the floor. She tried to dial 911 but none of the phones were working, so she went outside and began knocking on her neighbors’ doors. When none of her neighbors answered, she continued down the road to a local restaurant where the owners lived upstairs, and they called the police.</p>

The victim’s body was found lying on the kitchen floor, on her right side, and her head was covered in blood. The lead forensics investigator noticed that there were blood droplets on the victim’s hip and leg that appeared different from the victim’s blood, as well as some additional drops on the kitchen floor. The shape of the drops indicated that “a blood source higher than she was on the floor was dropping blood” on the victim. There was also blood in the living room and on some of the furniture. Blood samples were taken from different areas of the kitchen and living room, along with fiber samples from the carpet (with and without blood) and impressions of the footprints.</p>
    <p id="b953-10" data-blocks='[["BL_953.9",953,[901,1311,752,869]]]'>[¶ 4] The medical examiner found that the victim had a fatal stab wound in the chest, approximately fifty stab wounds to her head and face, and additional superficial wounds on her arms and wrists, which suggested she had been warding off an attack. The examiner also observed tears and slight bleeding around the anus area, consistent with blunt force from a penis, but no evidence of a lubricant; and the examiner testified that there was likely pain associated with these tears. The state of the tears indicated they could have been made any time between some minutes or up to four hours before the victim’s death. Sperm cells were detected in the victim’s anus, but nowhere else.</p>

Hutchinson was ordered to give a DNA sample pursuant to 25 M.R.S. § 1574(1), (5)(B), which requires that persons convicted of certain crimes provide a sample of their DNA. Hutchinson’s sample was subsequently checked against the DNA samples in the state data base of unsolved forensic cases in Maine, and Hutchinson’s profile came up as a match with the DNA samples taken from the body of the victim in this case.</p>

Hutchinson claimed he had cut his hand at a friend’s workplace.</p>

Samples of the blood that had been found in front of the kitchen sink and on the kitchen floor were also a match. Subsequently, police determined that Hutchinson had lived only a few blocks from the victim’s home at the time of the murder, and that Hutchinson’s parents had also lived nearby.</p>

Prior to trial, Hutchinson filed a motion to suppress the DNA evidence, arguing that the initial collection of his DNA sample pursuant to the statute had been in violation of the federal and state constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures.

He admitted that he had actually met the victim about a year before her murder at a local bar, that they had had sex a couple of times before, and that she had invited him to come over on the day of her death. Hutchinson said that when he arrived, he and the victim had consensual anal and vaginal intercourse, but that another person later entered the house, knocked him out, and stabbed the victim. Hutchinson further testified that his hand had been cut during his scuffle with the person, and that he had stepped over the victim when he ran from the house in order to escape the unknown intruder. Hutchinson claimed that he did not come forward and tell the police what had happened because he was so ashamed that he had run from the house.</p>

Second, we discuss whether Maine’s murder sentencing scheme violates the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury as that right has been applied in a line of decisions beginning with <em>Apprendi v.

Upon receipt of the DNA profile, personally identifiable information is removed and the profile is assigned a number. The record matching the number with the identifying information is stored in a separate data base. Further, the records may only be released for statistical interpretation if all personally identifiable information is removed. <em>See 25 </em>M.R.S. § 1577(3).</p>
