    <p id="b285-12" data-blocks='[["BL_285.14",285,[233,1830,751,506]]]'>The question presented in this appeal is whether the absolute privilege afforded a sexual assault counselor’s records is waived when the assault victim releases the counseling records to the Commonwealth. We affirm the Superior Court’s holding that the minor sexual abuse victim and his family waived the privilege protecting the victim’s family therapy counseling records when they permitted the prosecution to have access to these records.</p>
    <p id="Abm1" data-blocks='[["BL_285.15",285,[1034,212,754,594]]]'>Appellee Davis, who is the victim’s stepfather, separated from the victim’s mother in 1989. The victim (P.P.), along with his mother, sister, and biological father, underwent family counseling at the Family Institute of Philadelphia (Family Institute) beginning in February of 1991. During these counseling sessions in 1991, P.P. first disclosed his stepfather’s alleged acts of sexual abuse against him, which P.P. stated began in 1983, when P.P. was 6 years old, and continued until 1986. P.P. was 14 years old at the time of trial.</p>

Family Institute filed a motion to quash the subpoena. Davis contended that because the prosecution had access to P.P.’s family therapy records and intended to call P.P.’s family therapist at trial, the trial court should allow Davis access to these records in order for him to properly conduct cross-examination. The trial judge ruled P.P.’s family therapy records were privileged pursuant to the sexual assault counselor privilege, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5945.1(b),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and quashed the subpoena. Appellee Davis was subsequently tried non-jury and convicted of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> corruption of a minor,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and endangering the welfare of a child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Davis was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of not less than five (5) years nor more than ten (10) years, to be followed by a consecutive five (5) year period of probation imposed for corruption of a minor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The Commonwealth contended Davis is seeking P.P.’s counseling records to substantiate Davis’ <em>suspicion </em>that P.P.’s therapist believes P.P. is a “pathological liar”, and has noted such an observation in her counseling records. The Commonwealth asserted that even if P.P.’s records contain such an observation by P.P.’s therapist, it would be inadmissible expert opinion evidence and would not have been admissible for purposes of impeaching P.P.’s credibility at trial.</p>

The Superior Court held the trial court erred in quashing the subpoena. The Superior Court was unable to determine whether Davis had been prejudiced by this error, however, since the court had no way of knowing whether the trial court’s withholding of the contents of these records from Davis had contributed to his conviction. The Superior Court vacated judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for the trial court to make this determination after Davis has had an opportunity to review P.P.’s therapy records. The Commonwealth then filed its petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
