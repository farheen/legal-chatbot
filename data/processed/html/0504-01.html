All three argue that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions and that the court erroneously denied their motions for a new trial based on a claim of newly discovered evidence. Bell and Hargraves maintain in addition that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of the crime, and Bell and Lawson contend that a comment made by the prosecutor in his closing argument substantially prejudiced their rights and require reversal. We reject the contentions of Lawson and Har-graves and affirm their convictions. We agree with Bell, however, that the evidence against him was insufficient to go to the jury, and accordingly we reverse his conviction and direct the entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>

The house was a two-story single-family home in a residential neighborhood, but no one appeared to live there; instead, there was a sign hanging from the front of the house which said “D.C. Bears Athletic Club.” In the course of a six-week surveillance, the police saw large numbers of people entering the house in the late evening and early morning hours and leaving around 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. Whenever anyone would knock on the front door seeking entry, the same person — described in the testimony as a man “with a salt-and-pepper beard [whose] nickname was Shorty”— would open the door and look up and down the street before permitting the visitor to enter.</p>

Twenty to twenty-five police officers, some with their guns drawn, approached the house, and Detective Edward Curley knocked on the door. Appellant Bell opened the door in response to the knock but, upon seeing the officers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> immediately tried to close it. Curley testified that he and other officers “forced the door open ... rushed in and secured the three floors of the premises.” They went through the living room to the dining room, where they found four or five persons, including Ronald Humphries, sitting around a table laden with cards and money. Curley arrested Humphries, searched him, and discovered $8,588 in cash in his pocket. After the house was secured, Curley found a paper bag containing more than $16,000 under Humphries’ chair. <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>Detective Curley testified that Humphries said “it was his game and his money.”</p>

From the bar the police recovered money, ledgers and other records, and membership cards for the D.C. Bears Athletic Club. Detective Wells forced open a padlocked storage closet and found “about twenty or thirty” bottles of liquor, a quantity of beer, mixers, cups, plates, records, and more membership cards. These cards were signed by Bob Johnson, president of the Club, and appellant Hargraves, who had signed her nickname “Peaches” in the space next to the word “Secretary.” Nearby Wells found Hargraves’ purse containing a key ring with a number of keys on it, including one to the padlock on the storage closet<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and another key to the front door of the house. Detective Wells also searched Lawson and found in his pockets some dice, $504 in cash, and a key which “seemed to be the type of key that was on the key ring that belonged to Ms. Har-graves.” A further search of the basement yielded a box of business cards advertising free crabs at a crab feast sponsored by “Rudie, Bob, Bleach, Sunny, and Mack” and an envelope addressed to “Mr. Rudy Lawson” at the S Street address.</p>

Hargraves herself admitted in her testimony that she had signed the membership cards, but claimed that she had done so only because the regular secretary was unavailable.

This action, without more, cannot support an inference that he was acting as the doorman that evening or even temporarily standing guard at the door.

The Judge will instruct you, and what the government is charging Mr. Lawson with, is operating or [being] the operator of 2411 S Street on November 15, 1986. Now, first of all, what was the evidence on that point? Well, first of all, you heard Detective Wells tell you Mr. Lawson was in the basement near the bar on November 15th and that he had what appeared to be keys in his possession which Detective Wells thought fit the front door of 2411 S Street.</blockquote>
    <p id="b576-8" data-blocks='[["BL_576.7",576,[219,1969,748,184]]]'>At this point Lawson’s counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion and gave a curative instruction to the jury.</p>

Officer Wells testified that the key taken from Lawson appeared to be the same type of key as one found in Hargraves’ purse and that another officer took it upstairs to see if it would fit the lock on the front door. Counsel objected on hearsay grounds because Wells himself had not been present when this was done. The court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony about this key.</p>

We will reverse its decision only if it appears “unreasonable, irrational, or unfair ... or unless the situation is so extreme that failure to reverse would result in a miscarriage of justice.” <em>Lee v.

We perceive no abuse of discretion here. Although the prosecutor should not have mentioned the key in his summation, his lapse was minor. The comment had little relationship to the issue of innocence or guilt, and the other evidence against Lawson was strong. <em>See, e.g., Villacres v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/357/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="357 A.2d 423" data-case-ids="8041248" data-case-paths="/a2d/357/0423-01">357 A.2d 423</a>, 428 (D.C.1976).

In addition, the trial court twice instructed the jury to disregard what the prosecutor had said, first when sustaining the objection during closing argument and again in its general charge. Without any indication to the contrary, we must presume that the jury followed these instructions. <em>E.g., Smith v.
