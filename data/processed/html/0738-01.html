The developer alleged that New Castle County arbitrarily treated the developer differently from other, similarly situated landowners by preventing the developer from opening its hotel. The record establishes that the hotel failed to comply with the applicable zoning codes, and that the Board of Adjustment denied the developer’s request for nine variances. None of the other Board decisions relied upon by the developer to show disparate treatment were <em>prima facie </em>identical. Thus, the developer’s equal protection claim fails at the threshold. In addition, the Board’s decision, which was not challenged,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> provides a rational basis for its denial of the developer’s requested variances. As a result, there was no support for the developer’s claim that it was treated arbitrarily. We also find no merit to the developer’s due <a id="p741" href="#p741" data-label="741" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*741</a>process and inverse condemnation claims.

    <p id="b789-5" data-blocks='[["BL_789.5",789,[149,727,752,1018]]]'>In April 1990, a predecessor of Wilmington Hospitality, LLC, (“WH”), owned by Joseph L. Capano and Albert A. Vietri, obtained final plan approval for a hotel to be built at the intersection of 1-95 and Airport Road in New Castle County. The Record Plan authorized construction of a 118,805 square foot hotel. WH hired an architect, who designed a 155,480 square foot hotel. Nothing more was done for several years, as market conditions were unfavorable. In June 1998, after another architect completed the plans, WH applied for a building permit for a 155,480 square foot hotel. A few weeks later, WH entered into a sewer agreement with the County that recited the hotel size as 118,-805 square feet. The County issued a building permit and WH proceeded with construction.</p>
    <p id="b789-6" data-blocks='[["BL_789.6",789,[150,1783,751,818]],["BL_789.7",789,[948,282,751,198]]]'>In May 2000, as the hotel neared completion, WH requested an inspection by the County in order to obtain a certificate of occupancy (“CO”). The inspectors noticed that the parking configuration was not consistent with the Record Plan. They also determined, among other things, that: (i) the hotel was significantly larger than the size stated in the Record Plan; (ii) it included banquet halls, meeting rooms, and other facilities that would necessitate additional parking; and (iii) it included a kitchen area for which no building permit had been issued. On June 22, 2000, the County issued a violation notice to WH and revoked its building permit. The violation notice stated that WH had provided “false statements ... in the application and/or on the plans on which the permit or approval was based.”</p>
    <p id="b789-9" data-blocks='[["BL_789.8",789,[947,506,755,812]]]'>Over the next several months, WH tried to resolve the problems arising from the discrepancies between the Record Plan and the hotel, as built. In addition to submitting revised plans for parking spaces, WH discussed the possibility of opening only a portion of the hotel until the entire matter was resolved, but the County rejected that option. WH applied to the New Castle County Board of Adjustment for nine variances that, if granted, would have enabled WH to obtain a CO. The Board held a two-day hearing in mid-July 2000 and announced its decision denying the application at the end of that month.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b789-10" data-blocks='[["BL_789.9",789,[947,1352,753,862]]]'>In August 2000, WH asked the County to issue a temporary CO, allowing the first four floors of the hotel (102,120 square feet) to be opened. The County responded that no CO would be issued unless WH removed, or rendered unusable, the top two floors. In later discussions and correspondence, the County suggested either tearing down those floors or filling them with foam. In September, WH’s lender met with the County, but the County remained steadfast in its position. As a result, the lender demanded that WH bring the hotel into compliance with all applicable codes; declared WH’s loan in default; and required WH to deposit $1.5 million in additional collateral.</p>
    <p id="b789-11" data-blocks='[["BL_789.10",789,[949,2248,752,351]],["BL_790.1",790,[211,286,752,498]]]'>On October 20, 2000, WH filed an action in the Court of Chancery seeking a mandatory injunction requiring the County to issue a CO. The Vice Chancellor was appointed an acting Superior Court judge in order to give him jurisdiction to hear and decide all matters relating to the hotel, <a id="p742" href="#p742" data-label="742" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*742</a>including WH’s appeal of the Board’s decision denying the variances. After denying WH’s motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, the court set a trial date for November 28, 2000. The day before trial, however, WH notified the Court of Chancery that it was not ready to proceed. WH never prosecuted its Chancery action, which was dismissed in 2005.</p>
    <p id="b790-4" data-blocks='[["BL_790.4",790,[206,819,756,917]]]'>While seeking a resolution that would allow the hotel to open, WH also explored the possibility of selling the hotel. The County advised that it would be willing to work with a new owner, but that the deed to the new owner would have to include a restriction barring the Capano and Vietri families from having any interest in the hotel for 20 years. In a letter dated February 2, 2001, the County advised WH of the items that had to be resolved before a temporary or permanent CO would be issued to any buyer. The February 2 letter indicates that, instead of foaming or tearing down the top two floors of the hotel, those floors could be made inaccessible by locking all the doors and eliminating elevator access.</p>
    <p id="b790-5" data-blocks='[["BL_790.5",790,[206,1771,752,915]],["BL_790.6",790,[1011,286,747,82]]]'>WH found two potential buyers, and entered into an agreement of sale with Reese Hotels, LLC in November 2001. By that time, the lender had instituted foreclosure proceedings and WH had declared bankruptcy. The Reese sale, which was approved by the bankruptcy court, would have netted WH approximately $7.45 million after repaying the lender. That sale never closed, however, because the County would not issue a CO. In a letter dated November 2, 2001, the County explained that the February 2 letter reflected the terms of a possible settlement that the Court of Chancery had asked the parties to discuss. The parties did not reach agreement, and the County’s November letter advised that no CO would be issued until the unauthorized excess floor space was removed.</p>
    <p id="b790-7" data-blocks='[["BL_790.7",790,[1009,402,750,1070]]]'>Before agreeing to sell the hotel to Reese, WH had entered into a settlement agreement with its lender. The settlement agreement gave WH until March 31, 2002, to pay the lender $13.85 million in satisfaction of its outstanding debt. WH failed to make the payment, and the lender took title to the hotel in April 2002. One year later, the lender sold the hotel to Parkside V, LLC for $11.2 million. Parkside also acquired an adjacent parcel of land and used some of that additional land to address parking and other problems identified by the Board in its denial of WH’s application for nine variances. On January 20, 2004, the Board approved Parkside’s application for six variances. Because Parkside included the deed restriction that the County had insisted upon, it was not required to tear down the top two floors of the hotel.</p>
    <p id="b790-8" data-blocks='[["BL_790.8",790,[1005,1498,752,1026]]]'>WH filed this action in the Superior Court on July 29, 2003. The complaint purports to allege four claims against the County: 1) violation of substantive due process, based on the County’s alleged bad faith and its “arbitrary and irrational conduct and ... egregious abuse of power which shocks the conscience;” 2) violation of equal protection, based on the County’s alleged failure to treat WH in the same, manner as similarly situated landowners; 3) a taking of WH’s property without just compensation, based on the County allegedly depriving WH of all economically viable use of its property (inverse condemnation); and 4) breach of contract, based on the County’s refusal to issue a temporary CO under the terms of an agreement allegedly set forth in the County’s February 2, 2001 letter.</p>

The trial court also denied WH’s motion to amend the complaint to allege a temporary or partial taking by the County. After trial, the jury found in favor of WH on the equal protection claim and awarded WH $7.5 million in damages. The jury found in favor of the County on the breach of contract claim. The trial court denied the County’s post-trial motions and this appeal followed.</p>

To prevail on the first prong, WH must establish “an extremely high degree of similarity” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> between its circumstances and those of others who were treated differently (“comparators”). Stated another way, the comparators must be <em>“prima facie </em>identical in all relevant respects.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Generally, this is a fact question for the jury, but summary judgment is appropriate “where it is clear that no reasonable jury could find the similarly situated prong met.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> If WH establishes disparate treatment, it then must prove that the County lacked any rational basis for that treatment.

    <p id="b791-12" data-blocks='[["BL_791.9",791,[959,600,754,874]]]'>The trial court denied the County’s motion for summary judgment, without addressing the relevant standards or analyzing the record. The trial court simply concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact in dispute. The record is clear, however, that none of WH’s comparators were similarly situated. WH applied for nine variances that would, among other things, increase the maximum permitted size from 118,805 to 158,176 square feet; reduce the number of parking spaces from 325 to 202; and reduce setbacks, open space requirements and buffers. The Board found, based on documents and testimony of numerous witnesses, that WH did not act in good faith:</p>

There is evidence in the record to indicate that the applicant (or his agents) was repeatedly given the opportunity to discover the discrepancy between the record plan and the proposed building size. Many of these opportunities occurred prior to the time construction commenced .... Moreover, there was evidence submitted to suggest that the developer was aware of the discrepancy and took affirmative steps to conceal the <a id="p744" href="#p744" data-label="744" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*744</a>discrepancy from third parties. In particular, the Artesian Water letters (with the changed square footage numbers) and the representation in the HVS appraisal that the developer had communicated to it that, despite the record plan’s square footage limitation of 118,805, the “correct figure” was 156,000 square feet, are illustrative of this point.

Krishnas sought a variance permitting construction of a 31,412 square foot hotel, which would be 2,228 square feet larger than permitted by code and 3,063 square feet larger than the record plan.
