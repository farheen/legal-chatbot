The action was filed initially in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, invoking that court’s original jurisdiction. It was decided by the court on four motions: <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>PHICO’s motion for summary judgment, American Casualty’s cross-motion for summary judgment, the CAT Fund’s application for summary relief, and American Casualty’s cross-application for summary relief.</p>

They also granted the CAT Fund’s application for summary relief, in part, and denied American Casualty’s cross-application for summary relief.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[141,916,754,1185]]]'>The facts of this case are not in dispute. David and Suzanne Richard filed a suit for damages against Sharon DiRienzo and several other defendants in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (the Richard action). That suit has been settled for an amount in excess of two million dollars. The Richards, in their own right and acting as parents and natural guardians of Christopher Richard, alleged that DiRienzo was negligent in providing nursing care and treatment at the time Suzanne Richard was about to give birth to Christopher on January 29 and 30, 1988. At that time, DiRienzo was acting in the course and scope of her employment by Bryn Mawr Hospital as a delivery room nurse. The Richards claimed that, as a result of DiRienzo’s conduct, severe and permanent brain damage was sustained by Christopher, and that pain and suffering and expenses were inflicted upon David and Suzanne Richard. The complaint further alleged that Bryn Mawr Hospital was hable to the Richards as the employer of DiRienzo and also because of its own negligence.</p>

American Casualty had issued to DiRienzo a Professional Nurse’s Liability Policy, No. NS03807436 (American Casualty policy). That policy was subject to a limit of $1,000,-000.00. The policy covered both DiRienzo’s professional and non-business activities. American Casualty contends that its policy specifically stated in its “other insurance” clause that, in effect, it provided excess insurance only. DiRienzo paid an annual premium of $58.00 for the policy.</p>
    <p id="b159-8" data-blocks='[["BL_159.8",159,[941,361,757,756]]]'>PHICO issued two policies of insurance to Bryn Mawr Hospital which afforded coverage to DiRienzo by virtue of her status as an employee there. A Health Care Provider’s Comprehensive Liability Policy (No. HP2001), provided Institutional Professional Liability Coverage (Coverage C) for the hospital’s professional employees, other than physicians, for liability arising out of rendering or failure to render professional services (the PHICO Primary Policy). The “other insurance” clause in the PHICO Primary Policy stated that its coverage was primary. The limit of that policy was $200,000.00, which covered DiRienzo as a professional employee of the hospital.</p>
    <p id="b159-9" data-blocks='[["BL_159.9",159,[941,1154,755,515]]]'>Coverages A, B, D and E in Phico’s Primary Policy do not apply to DiRienzo in this case and are not at issue. The premium for the PHICO Primary Policy was $121,563.00 for the period of two months and ten days for which PHICO has provided such information (November 20, 1987 through February 1, 1988). During the same period, the portion of the premium attributable to Coverage C, “Institutional Professional Liability,” was $63,643.00..</p>
    <p id="b159-10" data-blocks='[["BL_159.10",159,[940,1708,757,1039]]]'>PHICO also issued to Bryn Mawr Hospital a second policy (No. EP2001) (the PHICO Excess Policy) which provided for DiRienzo, as a professional employee of Bryn Mawr Hospital, excess “Professional Liability” coverage with a $10,000,000.00 limit. The PHI-CO Excess Policy consisted of two parts: Coverage A, titled “Professional Liability,” which was the only coverage applicable to DiRienzo in this case, and Coverage B, titled “Umbrella Liability.” Umbrella Liability coverage, however, is not at issue in this matter because that coverage expressly excluded insurance for liability arising from professional services. The premium for the Phico excess policy, for the period of two months and ten days (November 20, 1987 through February 1, 1988) was $120,188.00, of which amount $105,119.00 applied to Coverage A, “Professional Liability,” while $15,-069.00 applied to Coverage B, “Umbrella Liability.”</p>

Co. v. United Services Automobile Assn., </em><a href="/f-supp/676/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="676 F.

      <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>policy were concurrent primary policies and that, hence, the “other insurance” clauses in both policies were triggered. As a result of this triggering, the “other insurance” clause contained in the PHICO <em>primary </em>policy had to be interpreted, and it was concluded to be a “pro rata” clause which meant that the PHICO <em>primary </em>policy had to be treated as providing <em>primary </em>coverage to Nurse DiRienzo. Because the American Casualty policy contained “an unqualified excess clause” (<a href="/pa-commw/145/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="602 A.2d 904" data-case-ids="1426544" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/145/0184-01">602 A.2d 904</a>, at 909), the Commonwealth Court thought that it had to be interpreted as providing <em>residual primary </em>coverage. Hence, that Court ruled that PHICO’s <em>primary </em>policy paid the first $200,000.00 of indemnity expense and that when that limit was exhausted, that American Casualty’s <em>primary </em>policy as residual primary insurance had to kick in for the next $1,000,000.00.</p>

She was, however, found to be entitled to coverage by the CAT Fund by virtue of being a hospital employee. Hence the CAT Fund was held to be responsible for providing coverage up to $1,000,000.00 for DiRienzo’s negligence (if any) as a hospital employee, but only after the exhaustion of the two policies found to be <em>primary. </em>Because DiRienzo was found not to be a health care provider, however, she was found not to be entitled to a separate, additional $1,000,000.00 of CAT Fund coverage in her individual capacity. Finally, the Commonwealth Court determined that American Casualty’s policy was <em>not excess </em>insurance coverage vis-a-vis the CAT Fund under 40 P.S. § 1301.705.</p>

This policy provided Institutional Professional Liability Coverage (Coverage C) for the hospital’s professional employees, other than physicians. For this coverage Nurse DiRienzo paid nothing. Nurse DiRienzo was also covered by an excess policy issued by American Casualty to a limit of $1,000,000. For this additional coverage, Nurse DiRienzo paid an annual premium of $58.00. Nurse DiRienzo secured $1,200,000 of liability coverage for only $58.00.
