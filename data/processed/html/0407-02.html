Dr. Marc Kress, an employee of Appellant, diagnosed Appellee as having a ventral hernia. On the recommendation of his personal physician, Dr. Conrad King, Appellee consulted a surgeon, Dr. Nicholas Pedano, regarding surgical repairs of the hernia. Unfortunately, Appellee could not have the surgery performed since the hospital where Dr. Pedano had staff privileges would not accept Appellee’s health insurance. To further complicate matters, Appellant refused to authorize payment for Ap-pellee’s medical treatment.</p>

Appellant answered the claim by denying all material allegations. Additionally, Appellant alleged that Appellee was precluded from receiving benefits pursuant to the forfeiture provision of Section 306(f)(4) of the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act (the Act) of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. § 531(4). The referee concluded that Appellee had met his burden of proving a compensable injury sustained in the course of his employment. Consequently, the referee granted the claim petition and ordered Appellant to pay Appellee temporary total disability benefits. Appellant appealed the referee’s decision to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) which affirmed, finding that there was substantial competent evidence to support the referee’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>

Secondly, Appellee asserts that he was willing to have medical procedures performed, but, he was prevented from having such reasonable medical treatment on account of Appellant’s conduct when it did not fulfill its statutory obligation to pay for the services, Section 306(f)(1) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

There, the claimant injured his eye in the course of his employment, was paid compensation benefits and subsequently returned to work without a loss of earnings. Claimant then filed a petition seeking compensation for the loss of use of his right eye. Claimant’s employer argued that the specific loss was caused by Claimant’s own refusal to undergo corrective surgery. We held that whether the Claimant sustained a qualifying specific loss of his eye necessarily included the issue of whether reasonable medical procedures will restore some portion of the loss of function, and therefore, Claimant’s refusal of reasonable medical services may be considered at the entitlement hearing.</p>

The schedule of payment is dependent upon the extent of the disability, <em>i.e., </em>total or partial, and reflects payments based on an incapacity to perform one’s duties and the loss of earning power resulting from that injury. <em>Killian v.

This amount is statutorily prescribed and is intended to include compensation for all disability emanating from or connected with the loss of a member or a permanent injury to that member. Moreover, a finding of a specific loss is not connected to a finding concerning a claimant’s <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>continuing ability to work. Thus, even though a claimant is employed at the same work and at the same wages as before a specific loss is suffered, he would not be barred from compensation under Section 306(c). <em><a href="/pa/468/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="468 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1719628" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0200-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/468/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="468 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1719628" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0200-01">at 206</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="468 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1719628" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0200-01">360 A.2d at 623</a>.</p>

Following the grant of benefits in such a case, if the employer wishes to have the benefits terminated, a subsequent proceeding may be initiated at which time the employer may raise, among other issues, a Section 306(f)(4) forfeiture issue. However, in cases of Section 306(c) specific loss, only one proceeding is needed where it must be determined whether the employee has actually sustained a qualifying specific loss. It is at this specific loss entitlement hearing where questions of correctability and medical treatment are relevant and thus they may be addressed here, if at all, since conceptually employers are precluded from commencing subsequent termination proceedings once the injury is deemed permanent and specific loss awards are ordered. Therefore, the issue of eorreetability is integral to determining whether an award in a specific loss action is appropriate.</p>

Since the employer chose to contest whether the injury was work related, that was the only issue ripe for review before the referee.

In <em>Joyce Western, </em>this Court was faced with the issue of whether section 306(f)(4) applied to a specific loss claim. We held that because the correctability of the claimant’s eye injury was critical to determining whether he had suffered the permanent loss of use of that eye, the issue of whether the claimant had refused reasonable medical treatment was relevant. <em><a href="/pa/518/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="518 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1811593" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0191-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/518/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="518 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1811593" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0191-01">at 198-99</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="518 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1811593" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0191-01">542 A.2d at 994</a>.

Maj. op. at 409-410. Forfeiture under section 306(f)(4) is available to the employer after benefits have been awarded. Maj. op. at 409. In a specific loss claim there is only one proceeding, and the question of available medical treatment is relevant when entitlement is being determined. <em><a href="/pa/518/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="518 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1811593" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0191-01">Id.</a> </em>However, there can be more than one proceeding in a disability claim.

The language of section 306(f)(4) does not limit its applicability to specific types of workers’ compensation claims or to particular stages of a workers’ compensation proceeding. As this Court stated in <em>Joyce Western, </em>“[tjhere is no dispute that Section 306(f)(4) of the Act applies to specific loss cases as well as to disability cases.” <a href="/pa/518/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="518 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1811593" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0191-01">518 Pa. at 199</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="518 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1811593" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0191-01">542 A.2d at 994</a>. Under the majority’s analysis, where an employer denies liability for an alleged injury and a claimant files a Claim Petition, the employer may not use the forfeiture provision as an alternative defense. The majority states that “it is conceptually impossible for an employer to contest whether an injury was work related ... yet at the same time invoke the forfeiture provision of Section 306(f)(4) because such a tactic necessarily admits liability for the underlying work related injury.” Maj. op. at 410. I do not agree that using the forfeiture provision as an alternative defense necessarily admits liability. The use of an alternative defense allows the employer to present evidence showing that even though the workers’ compensation referee might find that the claimant suffered a disabling injury in the course and scope of his employment, the claimant forfeited his right to receive the benefits to which he would otherwise be entitled.</p>
