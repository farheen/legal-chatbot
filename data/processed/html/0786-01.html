Inter-Tel was founded over thirty-five years ago by Steven G. Mihaylo. Mihaylo remains Inter-Tel’s largest stockholder, owning 19% of its shares. Although the plaintiffs arguments often echo those made by Mihaylo, Mihaylo himself is not a plaintiff in this or any other lawsuit involving Inter-Tel. Mihaylo has not been deposed in the case and has not submitted affidavit testimony.</p>
    <p id="b837-5" data-blocks='[["BL_837.6",837,[159,860,754,343]]]'>For the past several years, Inter-Tel has been the subject of a tumultuous struggle between Mihaylo and Inter-Tel’s independent board majority.

During 2005 itself, Inter-Tel received several soft overtures from potential buyers. These included Mitel, one of Inter-Tel’s leading competitors, which could expect to capture synergistic gains if it merged with Inter-Tel. The Mitel contact was not new, as Inter-Tel and Mitel had discussed the possibility of merging two years before.</p>
    <p id="b837-7" data-blocks='[["BL_837.8",837,[162,1784,752,662]],["BL_837.9",837,[962,215,750,93]]]'>Among the other parties that contacted Inter-Tel during 2005 was the private equity firm Francisco Partners. In autumn 2005, a special committee of independent directors was formed to consider the various expressions of interest Inter-Tel had received. Eventually, things got serious with one bidder. But, at the same time, the Inter-Tel board was internally riven, with a majority of the board wanting Mi-haylo, who had served as Inter-Tel’s CEO since its founding, to retire from that position. Eventually, both the interested bidder and Mihaylo went away, but only one did so permanently.</p>
    <p id="b837-10" data-blocks='[["BL_837.10",837,[961,348,753,396]]]'>In February 2006, Mihaylo resigned as CEO. In early March, he resigned as a director. By that time, the interested bidder had ultimately decided not to make a firm offer. Whether the obvious strife between the corporation’s founder and the board majority had an effect, the record does not reveal.</p>
    <p id="b837-11" data-blocks='[["BL_837.11",837,[962,791,755,561]]]'>But what transpired is suggestive of that possibility. Upon resigning as director, Mihaylo filed a Schedule 13D indicating that he was considering his alternatives regarding his investment in Inter-Tel. Because of that, the Inter-Tel Special Committee remained active, given the possibility that Mihaylo himself might propose a strategic alternative. On the heels of Mihaylo’s filing, another party made an expression of interest.</p>
    <p id="b837-12" data-blocks='[["BL_837.12",837,[962,1391,755,352]]]'>Mihaylo soon sought re-election to the Inter-Tel board, indicating his intent to elect a slate of three directors, including himself, to Inter-Tel’s board, at the 2006 annual meeting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> He also proposed a nonbinding resolution calling on the board to sell Inter-Tel to the highest bidder.</p>

Mi-haylo’s proposed slate was seated on the board, and the board was expanded from 10 to 11 members. Mihaylo was also guaranteed the right to have his advisors and financial sponsors obtain access to reasonable due diligence in order to facilitate his ability to make an acquisition proposal. Furthermore, the settlement agreement provided that Inter-Tel would convene a special meeting at Mihaylo’s request if he wished to have a stockholder vote on a <a id="p790" href="#p790" data-label="790" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*790</a>proposal calling for the board to sell the company.</p>

The remaining six members of the Special Committee were and remain non-employee, outside directors whose independence has not been challenged by the plaintiff. The Special Committee retained UBS, which had been advising the board majority before the settlement, as its financial advisor.</p>

Most notable was a formal expression of interest that Mihaylo, along with a partner, Vector Capital, made on June 14, proposing to buy all of Inter-Tel’s shares for $22.50 a piece. After more due diligence, Mihaylo and Vector reiterated this bid on July 28. On August 11, the Special Committee rejected the bid as inadequate.</p>

The Special Committee again rejected the bid as inadequate financially, and also opined that the 30 day process was not value-maximizing because other bidders would be disadvantaged by Mihaylo’s much greater opportunity for due diligence.</p>
    <p id="b838-10" data-blocks='[["BL_838.11",838,[1002,911,749,134]]]'>Soon thereafter, Mitel came sniffing around again, as did some other parties. But no firm bids were made.</p>
    <p id="b838-11" data-blocks='[["BL_838.12",838,[1000,1077,753,548]]]'>Mihaylo, however, did put something on the table — a precatory resolution calling on the Inter-Tel board to sell the company in an auction. At a special meeting of stockholders held on October 24, 2006, over 50% of the Inter-Tel stockholders present voted against the resolution. After this defeat, Mihaylo and Vector withdrew their proposal to acquire Inter-Tel while reserving the right to change their minds.</p>
    <p id="b838-12" data-blocks='[["BL_838.13",838,[1001,1657,749,503]]]'>This showdown did little to calm the roiled waters. Interested parties kept coming forward and the Special Committee essentially continued to operate. By late 2006, both Mitel and Francisco Partners were again expressing interest. By January 2007, the two had paired up, with Francisco Partners being prepared to act as a financial partner for Mitel in acquiring Inter-Tel.</p>

In a public communication to the board, Mihaylo outlined his own ideas for increasing Inter-Tel’s profits and his suggestions for avoiding another electoral contest. According to the Inter-Tel board majority, Mihaylo’s non-public <a id="p791" href="#p791" data-label="791" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*791</a>strategy involved his desire to have Inter-Tel buy his shares at a premium to the prevailing market price. By early March, Mihaylo formally indicated his intention to run another proxy contest, and announced that he had terminated his alliance with Vector Capital.</p>
    <p id="b839-5" data-blocks='[["BL_839.6",839,[171,610,753,455]]]'>In the same general time period, Mitel and Francisco Partners had indicated a willingness to purchase Inter-Tel for $25 per share, subject to their receipt of due diligence.

Vector Capital suggested it would pay $26.50 per share after due diligence and that Mihaylo was not part of its proposal. Of course, Vector Capital had received extensive due diligence regarding Inter-Tel in the summer of 2006 when it was in partnership with Mihaylo. On the morning of April 26, the day the Special Committee and full board were to vote on whether to enter a merger agreement with Mitel, Vector Capital sent e-mail messages, floating the tantalizing prospect of a bid of over $27 if it could receive due diligence and indicating its likely unwillingness to present a topping bid if a merger agreement with another party was signed up.</p>

A full meeting of the Inter-Tel board was held, and the board voted the same way, with Mihaylo dissenting, and his two nominees Puri and Urish abstaining.

In that letter, Mihaylo complained that the Special Committee had been secretly considering acquisition proposals and had not asked him to bid or conducted a full auction. He expressed his opposition to the Mitel Merger and proposed an alternative transaction whereby Inter-Tel would engage in a leveraged recapitalization. The Mihaylo “Recap Proposal” involved the company using a 50-50% combination of cash on hand and new debt to acquire up to 60% of its shares for $28 a piece. Mi-haylo contended that the remaining shares would trade close to $30 a piece based on the corporation’s expected earnings. Mi-haylo premised his assumptions on a use of Inter-Tel’s own projections (which had not been prepared for use in concert with a leveraged recapitalization), while simultaneously disclaiming their reliability.

To its stockholders, Inter-Tel made similar arguments. It coupled them with reminders of Mihaylo’s own offer to buy the company for only $23.25 per share several months back, an offer that Mihaylo had supported with the argument that Inter-Tel’s stock price would drop markedly if his $23.25 offer went away. Given that argument, Inter-Tel said Mihaylo was in no credible position to argue either $25.60 per share was too low or that Inter-Tel’s remaining shares would likely trade above $30 after the first step of Mihaylo’s Recap Proposal was consummated.</p>

Mihaylo’s argument that his Recap Proposal promised a blended value above $29 was gaining some traction, in two respects. For starters, there was the possibility that the Recap Proposal might be more valuable.

More important, however, seemed to be ISS’s intuition that more value could be extracted from Mitel if Mitel felt the pressure of a “no” recommendation. In other situations, including one very recent one, an ISS no vote recommendation had caused an offeror to come out of pocket with a higher bid. Although it disclaims wielding power, ISS was believed by Inter-Tel, and its highly experienced proxy solicitors, Innisfree M &amp; A Incorporated, to be very influential as to its clients’ voting decisions. By recommending a “no” vote on June 19, ISS could aid its clients in their goal of value maximization by exerting pressure on Mitel to up its offer. That motivation was supported by ISS’s sense that the Mitel offer was not at an optimal price. In reaching that determination, ISS took into account Inter-Tel management’s statements that the company’s projections might be overly optimistic.</p>

But, on June 21, Mitel pushed back, trying to make clear to Inter-Tel’s stockholders that negotiations had closed and that they could take $25.60 or retain their shares. Mitel stressed that Inter-Tel’s <a id="p794" href="#p794" data-label="794" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*794</a>first quarter performance was below par, that Inter-Tel’s two years of internal strife were taking their toll, that its offer was far higher than any other party, including Mi-haylo, had actually bid to buy the whole company, and that Mitel was already taking on material risks in buying Inter-Tel at the existing price. A press release making this announcement was released on June 22.</p>

If Mitel could be assured of Mihaylo’s support, and an end to his status as a potentially very large appraisal petitioner, that would have real economic value in the sense that it would generate both an increased certainty of closing and eliminate a future risk. An effort was made to bring Mitel and Mihay-lo together around a revised Merger Agreement providing for an increase in the Merger consideration to $26 per share and a reduced break-up fee, among other things. Care was apparently taken to ensure that Mihaylo was approached in the most diplomatic and respectful manner, and Mitel itself reached out to him. But Mihaylo was not amenable, and raised a number of issues (such as concerns about the future of certain employees and of a company campus near his home) that reflected his unique (and understandable) perspective as a founder, rather than a focus on maximizing value for stockholders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

One important factor in that dynamic was the reality that Mitel was not financing its offer with internal resources. As noted, it had a financial partner, Francisco Partners, that was a private equity firm. Although Mitel as a strategic acquirer faced the usual temptations to stretch in order to make an acquisition of a competitor, Francisco had different interests. Repricing the deal would require Mitel to deal with Francisco at a time when it was becoming clear that the favorable debt financing markets that had been supporting a wave of private equity deals were heading south. From Francisco’s perspective, the prospect that the Inter-Tel transaction might go away may not have been sleep-disturbing. Although it doubtless had reputational reasons not to pull out on Mitel, Francisco was under no obligation to agree to different terms simply because its strategic partner was tempted to move higher, especially if such a move did not obviate Mihaylo’s objection.</p>

But I do find, as the plaintiff urges, that the Special Committee and its advis-ors had a keen eye out for circumstances that might, when taken together, plausibly justify a delay in the vote. Unlike the plaintiff, however, I find nothing in the record that suggests that the Special Committee had an improper motivation to delay the vote. None of the Special Committee members, including Stout, had been promised any position with Mitel after the Merger, and each expected to lose his board seat upon approval. Put simply, the Special Committee, on this record, must be viewed as supporting the Merger because they thought it was in the best interests of the Inter-Tel stockholders.</p>
    <p id="b843-7" data-blocks='[["BL_843.8",843,[172,1912,751,611]]]'>In support of that conclusion is the un-contradicted record that the Special Committee had been open to overtures from a variety of bidders, including ones whose previous overtures (such as Vector Capital and Mihaylo) generated reason for suspicion.

    <p id="b843-10" data-blocks='[["BL_843.11",843,[971,358,758,1340]]]'>For starters, Inter-Tel’s proxy solicitor, Alan Miller, and its CEO, Stout, had heard from several Inter-Tel stockholders that they favored a postponement. Some of these stockholders now owned more shares than they had at the May 25 record date, and could not vote those newly-bought shares on June 29. Some stockholders had positions that consisted entirely of shares bought after the record date. As the plaintiff notes, many of these investors were arbitrageurs and hedge funds. Miller detected sentiment in support of the Merger from many of them and a desire on their part for the vote to be had when they could participate. Because the Vector Capital overture had sent Inter-Tel’s stock price above $27, and because the price had subsequently dropped to the $24 range, Miller also believed that arbitrageurs would continue to buy shares if the meeting was postponed and a new, later record date was set. Because they could buy at a price below what Mitel was offering, they would have an incentive to see the Merger approved and lock in a gain.</p>
    <p id="b843-11" data-blocks='[["BL_843.12",843,[971,1724,756,922]],["BL_844.1",844,[193,236,752,395]]]'>But, in contrast to the plaintiff, I find that Inter-Tel also picked up on another kind of sentiment. The ISS “no” recommendation had started a high-stakes game of chicken. Mitel had not blinked. As June 29 approached, some Inter-Tel stockholders who were disinclined to favor the Merger when they believed a higher bid could be achieved began to get nervous. Millennium, one of Inter-Tel’s largest institutional stockholders, for example, was interested in a delay. ISS also indicated that its recommendation could change, but only if the vote were postponed and there was public information suggesting that the company’s financial circumstances had worsened in a manner that warranted reconsideration of its previous determina<a id="p796" href="#p796" data-label="796" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*796</a>tion. If a vote actually went forward on June 29 and the Inter-Tel stockholders acted on ISS’s recommendation, there was a growing sense that Mitel might just walk away, leaving Inter-Tel’s stockholders to enjoy the future benefits of their pro-rata share of the corporation’s value as a going concern.</p>
    <p id="b844-4" data-blocks='[["BL_844.5",844,[185,667,759,1592]]]'>Of course, the Mihaylo Recap Proposal was also in the air, in a way that the Special Committee believed had caused confusion. The Special Committee continued to believe that the Recap Proposal was not a sound or firmly financed one and that Mihaylo had premised it on an untenable use of the corporation’s projections. As the vote loomed, the Special Committee began to focus on the fact that Inter-Tel’s second quarter results would be available in early July, as the quarter would close on June 30. As things were trending, Inter-Tel’s internal tracking reports indicated that the company was likely to fall short of its expected earnings for the quarter, a second consecutive miss. Based on the same trends, Inter-Tel management believed it was also unlikely that Inter-Tel would achieve the projections in the remaining two quarters of FY 2007. Once that information became public, the Special Committee and its advisors thought it might be influential to ISS and stockholders, because it would suggest that there was no compelling reason for Mitel to increase its bid and that Mihaylo’s argument that he could use the company’s funds to buy up 60% of the shares at $28 and cause the remaining shares to trade at $30 was fallacious.</p>

Although the plaintiff lampoons this development, the record does indicate that the June 29 vote coincided with the period when players in the financial markets began to have a real appreciation — due to the termination and repricing of some big deals — that the favorable tide was reversing. The Special Committee and its advis-ors thought this factor, when taken together with Mitel’s failure to raise its bid and Inter-Tel’s performance, might be given weight by ISS and investors if they had additional time.</p>
    <p id="b844-7" data-blocks='[["BL_844.8",844,[991,847,753,669]]]'>Two related considerations also came into play. It was not until June 27, two days before the scheduled meeting, that Mihaylo’s proxy materials were finalized. His final materials included some changes required by the SEC, including forcing him to caveat his prediction that Inter-Tel’s shares would trade at $30 after a $28 buyback. Thus, the Special Committee viewed it as appropriate to premise a delay in part on the need to allow the stockholders to consider its proxy rival’s final materials before making a final voting decision.</p>

This changeover, so close to a scheduled vote, was highly unusual and created some confusion. Inter-Tel had heard that at least one large stockholder had difficulty giving a proxy as a result. In Mihaylo’s own materials, he had adverted to a possibility of a delay in the special meeting. This, along with the changeover and the widespread chatter among investors and the contending proxy solicitors, apparently caused ISS and some others to believe the meeting was being rescheduled.</p>

It does not seem to me to be shocking that the same directors would also be expected to prove that they acted reasonably if they took action that could have the effect of tilting the outcome of the vote on that merger. Furthermore, although it is true that the Inter-Tel board will lose their office if the Mitel Merger is approved, it is notable that the Special Committee members realized that if the Merger was defeated, the margin of defeat could be a subject of discussion in a proxy fight with Mihaylo at the September 12 annual meeting. And in the typical situation, the defeat of a board’s favored merger is likely to have corporate control ramifications, as it suggests an opening for other buyers in the M <em>&amp; A </em>market and for stockholder activists who might have their own ideas about how to better manage the corporation. Stated even more directly, even if there is some imprecision, it would be better to have clarity about the standard of review and to use the standard to decide cases, rather than to continue backing into the standard of review only after all the case-specific facts have been closely analyzed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_79" id="ref_footnote_1_79">79</a>

The Special Committee had a big burden to bear in that regard and had to continue its duel with Mihaylo over that question but it thought with more time it could make its case more persuasively.

One reason why premium bids are so compelling is that they deliver certain value right now, and therefore look attractive in comparison to promises that going alone will generate an even higher value in two or three years time, especially given the execution risk that attends such promises. It may have- been for that very reason that Mihaylo thought that the Inter-Tel board would sign up a merger with him in the $22 to $23 a share range in 2006.</p>

They remained free to convince their fellow stockholders that they would be better off economically if Inter-Tel rejected the Mitel bid and remained independent. If they made a convincing case that they were correct about where the most dollars could be had, they stood to prevail. In being inclined in this direction, I note that the plaintiff has failed to show that the agency problems resulting from the “separation of ownership from ownership” — i.e., from the fact that institutional investors have agency problems of their own because their interests are not identical to their investors’— are so substantial that stockholders will accept a merger at $25.60 per share when <a id="p817" href="#p817" data-label="817" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*817</a>they stand to make more profit on a risk— and inflation — adjusted basis by rejecting it.</p>

That change in behavior also negates the plaintiffs view that the circumstances that the Special Committee considered to have been consequential on June 29 in delaying the meeting were trifles. Taken together, the fuller information the stockholders had regarding Inter-Tel’s operating performance and prospects, the state of the debt markets, and the credibility and value of Mihaylo’s Recap Proposal was obviously influential. On August 2, the Inter-Tel stockholders had a much clearer understanding that their choice was down to taking the $25.60 per share Mitel bid or remaining stockholders in an independent Inter-Tel. No higher valued offer was coming from Mitel, Mihaylo, or another source.</p>

The Special Committee’s acts did not preclude the Inter-Tel stockholders from freely choosing to reject the Merger.

Indeed, in this context, a stockholder who simply failed to return a proxy would effectively cast a no vote.

But on this record, there is no basis for me to conclude that the Special Committee’s reporting of Inter-Tel’s second quarter results or management’s revision of the company’s projections was intentionally misleading or that the management revisions were not honestly made. Notably, as the plaintiff points out, the changes were not seismic in nature. A good faith decision to give the market more current and reliable information about the company’s future prospects is not coercive; to the contrary, such a decision would seem to give the stockholders information that is useful to them in voting. Moreover, Mihaylo was well positioned to, and did, take issue with the Special Committee’s assessment and the Special Committee faced a skeptical electorate unlikely to give unthinking weight to its views. By this time, Inter-Tel’s stockholders and the proxy advisory services were skeptical of both the Special Committee and Mihaylo and therefore viewed Inter-Tel’s revised projections through that lens. After considering the Special Committee’s and Mihaylo’s posi<a id="p818" href="#p818" data-label="818" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*818</a>tions, the overwhelming majority of Inter-Tel’s stockholders concluded that the Special Committee had the better of the arguments, especially given Mihaylo’s failure to come forward with a firm bid.</p>

Thus, stockholders who wanted to change corporate direction and toss out the incumbent majority could do so before the seasons even changed.

Stockholders invest to make moolah, cash, ching, green, scratch, cabbage, benjamins — to obtain that which Americans have more words for than Eskimos have for snow — money. When directors act for the purpose of preserving what the directors believe in good faith to be a value-maximizing offer, they act for a compelling reason in the corporate context. Of course, that does not mean that they have unlimited freedom to advance that purpose. But that is a question about the fit between the means they employ, not the end they are seeking to achieve. Here, the means the Special Committee chose — a short delay in the meeting schedule and a new record date— were, as I have found, reasonable in relation to their objective.

We believe that would be financially harmful to our stockholders and we want more time for them to consider the implications of their vote.

However the vote was running as of the time on June 29 when the meeting was rescheduled, the key question at the rescheduled meeting had to do with the merits of the Merger, not the prior tally. More fundamentally, the Special Committee’s very decision to reschedule the meeting on June 29, while continuing to recommend the Merger to the stockholders, signaled that the Merger would not have been approved that day. The plaintiff himself admitted that that was the case. Certainly, Mihaylo knew it to be so and publicly said it was so. Doubtless ISS and their clients realized it. No secret was kept.</p>

That fact would have little to do with the primary question — the economic merits of the Merger — and would be of even less relevance given that stockholders already certainly know that the Special Committee favored the Merger, had rescheduled the meeting to have more time to get support, and had moved the record date in a way that clearly enabled investors to move into the stock and obtain shares that could be voted in the meeting.</p>

On this provisional record, I do not find it likely that the information the plaintiff contends should have been disclosed was material to the Merger vote. Thus, I do not believe that the plaintiff has met its burden on the merits. For the same reason, I also believe that it would be improvident to enjoin the closing of the Merger until this information is disclosed. To' risk non-consummation of the deal by issuing an injunction until the disclosure of information that is both, in my judgment, irrelevant to the economic merits of the Merger and widely known would be imprudent.</p>

It is not clear that before June 29 the Special Committee knew all of Mihaylo's reasons for rejecting Mitel’s overture or the precise overture it made. It did know Mihaylo was unmoved. At a June 30 board meeting, Mihaylo told the board that he rejected a $26 offer largely because of these concerns unrelated to stockholder value. <em>See </em>PX 93 ("Mr. Mihaylo said he was not willing to [support a $26 bid] without knowing further details, including what would happen with Inter-Tel product lines, which employees would be terminated, and other post-transaction operational and strategic matters.”).</p>

The plaintiff put in a hearsay affidavit from someone recounting Mihaylo's charges. Inter-Tel filed sworn affidavits addressing this hearsay and plausibly rebutting it. I give no weight to the plaintiffs argument on this score. Mihaylo is well aware of this litigation, but he has never sought to intervene, and has never proffered an affidavit for the plaintiff. Without underestimating the time constraints under which the plaintiff has had to operate, I cannot buttress an injunction on speculative charges unsupported by reliable evidence, especially when the source has not submitted sworn testimony by affidavit and thereby subjected himself to cross-examination. In this respect, I note also that Mihaylo’s understandable emotional feelings about Inter-Tel (and his replacement as its CEO) resonate in his various statements accusing the Special Committee of wrongdoing. I cannot give those statements weight, given the lack of objective evidence supporting them or direct testimony by him, especially in view of the fact that the record illustrates that Mihaylo, despite his public denials, was given an ample opportunity to present a real topping bid but did not.</p>

In that case, this court employed the <em>Blasius </em>standard in reviewing whether to grant summary judgment against a board of directors that had adjourned a stockholder meeting as to only one of three items up for a vote. The other two items, which included a merger, had passed as the board had hoped. The third item, a proposal to add a substantial number of shares for issuance under the company’s stock option plan, did not have enough votes for passage that day. The corporation’s Chairman and CEO chaired the meeting. He stood to receive a material amount of any options granted under the proposal, if it was approved. When the proposal did not have enough votes to succeed, he, in accordance with the authority he had as chairman of the meeting under the company’s bylaws, adjourned the meeting as to that proposal only and continued to solicit proxies. The board did not, however, "inform all of its stockholders that it had called the adjournment....” <em>Id. </em>at *11.

The court refused, however, to find that the board could not prove a compelling justification for its action. Even though the proposal was one that the board could promulgate again immediately upon a no vote, the court left open the possibility that it could be convinced on a trial record that the financial and practical consequences of having to start from <a id="p812" href="#p812" data-label="812" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*812</a>scratch and incur all the costs of a brand-new special meeting and proxy solicitation might have justified the adjournment.</p>

For one thing, in <em>Peerless </em>the corporation considered the electorate informed enough to vote intelligently on two of the three ballot issues. It did not adjourn except for the proposal on which it had not generated enough stockholder support. More importantly, the proposal in <em>Peerless </em>was one that could be resubmitted to the stockholders freely at any later time. Here, if the Mitel Merger was voted down, Mitel could walk and the Inter-Tel stockholders could have irrevocably lost the chance to receive the offer.</p>

If, as the court was concerned about in <em>Peerless, </em>the adjournment was not fairly announced and the corporation solicited proxies without facing the opposition that it would have faced if it had acted more openly by informing the entire electorate of the continuation of the contest for votes, a straight-forward finding of inequity under the principles articulated in <em>Schnell </em>could be made. Likewise, if the board’s advocacy of the proposal was somehow tainted by the self-interest of the CEO and Chairman, principles of entire fairness could have bite. Given that the court retains substantial authority using traditional forms of review to set aside even stockholder-approved action if the stockholder vote is compromised by misleading or incomplete disclosures, I am skeptical that adjournments as to votes not implicating director tenure or corporate control that are entirely consistent with authority that stockholders, via the corporate charter or bylaws, vest in directors or officers, or that otherwise rests in directors as a matter of their statutory authority, should be reviewable under a compelling justification standard or even under the <em>Unocal </em>standard. When (using the economically based sense of the terms employed by Blasius) the principal has given the agent authority to adjourn, there is no principal-agent problem other than the question of whether the agent has used its discretion on the subject consistent with its fiduciary duties. So long as the directors are motivated by a good faith belief that the proposal is in the stockholders’ best interests, taking a short adjournment to gather additional votes in a fair way seems like the kind of business judgment the adjournment tool was designed to facilitate.</p>

But that example highlights another important difference between director elections and merger votes. In the merger vote context, inertia works against the success of the merger. In a contested election of directors under a plurality vote standard, the continuation of a campaign by the board forces the other side to keep actively soliciting because a just say no strategy is not feasible. That could give the incumbents using corporate funds an unfair advantage depending on the circumstances. No such exhaustion inequity is extant here.</p>
