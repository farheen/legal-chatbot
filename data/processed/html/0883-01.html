The court found the following facts, which essentially were uncontested. On June 26, 1996, Officers Epps and Farmer observed Jackson, David Carthens, and two others walking in <em>a </em>group in a high drug trafficking area. The group stopped, and Car-thens reached into his buttocks area and pulled out a small blue object. He handed the object to Jackson, who clutched it in her right hand. Carthens then retrieved another similar object, also from his buttocks area, and gave it to another member of the group. No money exchanged hands. The officers approached to make an investigative stop. Officer Epps asked Car-thens to hand over “what was in his butt,” and Carthens produced eighteen blue zi-plock baggies that field-tested positive for heroin. Officer Farmer told Jackson to “open [her] right hand.” Jackson complied. Her open hand disclosed two blue ziplock baggies, later shown to contain heroin.</p>

In <em>Cousart, </em>this court concluded that safety concerns justified the officers’ <em>Terry-based </em>command that the suspect raise and open his hands. <em>Cousart, </em><a href="/a2d/618/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="618 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="7350340" data-case-paths="/a2d/618/0096-01">618 A.2d at 99-100</a>. After a six-block chase that ended in a high drug area, the officers ordered the occupants of a vehicle to keep their hands up where the <a id="p886" href="#p886" data-label="886" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*886</a>officers could see them. <em><a href="/a2d/618/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="618 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="7350340" data-case-paths="/a2d/618/0096-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/618/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="618 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="7350340" data-case-paths="/a2d/618/0096-01">at 98</a>. One occupant dropped his hands and one shoulder from view, did something below the dashboard, "and came back up.” <em><a href="/a2d/618/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="618 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="7350340" data-case-paths="/a2d/618/0096-01">Id.</a> </em>The officers then ordered the occupant out of the car and found a pistol inches from where the occupant had been sitting. <em><a href="/a2d/618/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="618 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="7350340" data-case-paths="/a2d/618/0096-01">Id.</a></em>

In <em>Peay, </em>this court ruled there was reasonable suspicion and thus a justifiable <em>Teny </em>stop. Peay had watched three plain clothes police officers approaching his apartment building, whereupon he "rather hurriedly” went inside. <a href="/a2d/597/1318-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="597 A.2d 1318" data-case-ids="11947884" data-case-paths="/a2d/597/1318-01">597 A.2d at 1319</a>. One officer saw him soon thereafter on the third floor of the building clutching something in his left hand, which the officer believed " 'could possibly have been a weapon, a small knife, possibly a gun.’ ” <em><a href="/a2d/597/1318-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="597 A.2d 1318" data-case-ids="11947884" data-case-paths="/a2d/597/1318-01">Id.</a> </em>When the officer identified himself and asked what Peay was holding, Peay walked away. When the officer then touched or grabbed his shoulder, Peay dropped thirteen small bags of marijuana. <em><a href="/a2d/597/1318-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="597 A.2d 1318" data-case-ids="11947884" data-case-paths="/a2d/597/1318-01">Id.</a></em>
