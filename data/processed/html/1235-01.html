A police investigation revealed evidence that the alarm was false and had been set off accidentally by a shopping center maintenance supervisor, who, although aware he had set off the alarm, took no steps to notify anyone that the alarm was false. The plaintiffs<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> filed suit against a number of defendants, including the owner of the shopping center, the management company which it employed to manage the center, and the maintenance supervisor who allegedly set off the alarm (“the defendants”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The defendants have moved for summary judgment, contending that they owed no duty of care to the plaintiffs and that, even if they did, their alleged negligence was not <a id="p1237" href="#p1237" data-label="1237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1237</a>the proximate cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries.</p>

Power washing of sidewalks was performed three or four times a week, usually in the morning before customers arrived. At 8:15 a.m., when Mr. Hludzinski was in front of a London Fog store, spray from the power washer struck the store and set off the burglar alarm.</p>
    <p id="b1285-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1285.9",1285,[95,1655,755,767]]]'>It was not uncommon for false alarms to be set off occasionally by spray when the sidewalks were being power washed, and Mr. Hludzinski was aware of that fact. On the particular morning in question, Mr. Hludzinski was aware that he had set off the London Fog burglar alarm. Another maintenance employee .also heard the alarm. Seeing Mr. Hludzinski near the area where the alarm went off, he thought Hludzinski would do something about it. Mr. Hludzinski, however, ignored the alarm and continued with his power washing. The London Fog store had not yet opened.</p>

Following established procedure, it notified Suscom (the emergency communications center for Sussex County). It then called the store, but since it was closed and no store employee was there, it received no response. ADT then notified the state police, who dispatched Officer Reinoehl to respond. She proceeded southbound down Route 1 to the intersection at the entrance to Ocean Outlets III. She then began a left turn across the northbound lanes of Route 1 against a red light which was facing her. As she crossed through the intersection, she collided with the plaintiffs’ vehicle which was proceeding directly through the intersection on Route 1 northbound under a green light. One occupant of the plaintiffs’ vehicle was killed, and others received serious injuries.</p>

Officer Reinoehl testified in her deposition, however, that if she had been notified that the alarm was false, she would not have gone through the red light at the intersection. The accident occurred about twenty minutes after the alarm went off.</p>

They also contend the accident was not foreseeable from the defendants’ viewpoint. They also contend that they are not required to anticipate the negligence of another, in this case the officer and/or the plaintiffs. They also contend that imposition of a duty is a function of social policy, and that recognizing a duty of care in this case would open a Pandora’s Box of potential litigation which would have a chilling effect on the ability of shopping centers or other commercial or residential property owners to make use of alarm systems to guard against criminal activity. They contend that cases in other jurisdictions have refused to find that property owners owed a duty of care to persons injured in accidents where emergency vehicles were responding to false alarms, and that no Delaware case has extended the potential liability of property owners to persons who are not business invitees under circumstances like, the ones involved here. Finally, the defendants contend that even assuming that duty and negligence exist, their conduct was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries.</p>

      <em>Vest </em>and <em>Light </em>involved alleged malfunctions of an alarm. <em>Western Stone </em>was a case where an elderly pedestrian was startled and fell as a police car went by as it was responding to a false alarm. And in that case there was a dissent. In <em>Ford </em>the facts are only briefly stated, and neither the extent to which false alarms were a recurring event for the property owner there, nor the circumstances under which the false alarm was sounded, are stated. In <em>Gath </em>a false fire alarm was set off by construction taking place at a hotel, and the court found that the construction company had taken reasonable precautions to try to avoid false alarms and that the hotel could not be expected to have turned the <a id="p1240" href="#p1240" data-label="1240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1240</a>alarm off since the hotel was full of guests. The hotel owner was unable to determine whether the alarm was false or not and the construction company was unable to do so before the first fire truck arrived. In <em>Lodge </em>the court found that the direct cause of an accident which occurred when a fire truck responded to a false alarm was bad brakes on the fire truck. There was a dissent in that case as well. While it is true, as the defendants contend, that the courts in those cases reasoned that the emergency vehicle accident which each involved, or the manner of its occurrence, was not foreseeable, none of the cases involved a set of facts like those involved here.</p>
    <p id="b1288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1288.5",1288,[200,1186,753,552]]]'>In fact, the <em>Lodge </em>case recognizes that an emergency vehicle accident can be foreseeable in some circumstances. The holding in'that case was based upon the court’s view that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the fire truck would be negligently maintained and that an accident would be caused by bad brakes. In reaching that conclusion, however, the court made the following comment, which is relevant to this case:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1288.6",1288,[238,1764,717,709]]]'>Negligent transmission of a false alarm, by unnecessarily causing an emergency response, does increase the usual road hazards attendant on the operation of an emergency vehicle on the public roadways.

However, those cases support the conclusion that a duty of care to the plaintiffs should be imposed upon the defendants in this case. The interest to be protected is the interest in not being exposed unnecessarily to the increased risk of harm on the roadways which is incident to an emergency response. A duty of care should apply equally whether <a id="p1241" href="#p1241" data-label="1241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1241</a>the injured party is a police officer or, as here, the occupant of another vehicle which is struck by a police car while it is trying to negotiate an intersection through a red light. People driving upon the increasingly busy highways of this state are entitled to expect that a shopping center will take some steps to avoid unnecessary emergency police responses where it causes known false alarms. Nothing has been brought to the Court’s attention which would suggest that recognizing a duty of care in these circumstances will place an unreasonable burden upon shopping center owners. Moreover, the benefit to motorists in the vicinity of shopping centers in avoiding needless risks outweighs any such burden.</p>
    <p id="b1289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1289.5",1289,[88,1273,754,715]]]'>I am mindful that the imposition of a duty must not be based upon a retrospective view of the facts, but upon the view of the property owner before the accident occurred.
