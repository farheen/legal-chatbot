After the jury found Appellant guilty of the various sexual offenses he filed a motion to preserve physical evidence requesting the court to preserve the victim’s records pending appellate review. After a hearing on this issue, the trial court granted Appellant’s motion and directed that VRC surrender its records to the court for im-poundment. On April 21,1994, VRC filed an application to the court for supersedeas pending appeal. The court agreed to issue a stay until VRC filed an appeal to this Court. The court further directed VRC to secure and safely keep all files and records pertaining to this case pending appellate review. VRC then filed a timely appeal from this order.

C.S.A. section 5945.1. In a pre-trial motion Appellant sought to compel VRC to produce the victim’s records which allegedly contained exculpatory statements made by the victim. The Commonwealth and VRC objected to the disclosure of the victim’s records. On March 7, 1994, the trial court conducted a pre-trial hearing on Appellant’s motion to compel. After hearing testimony from the victim’s rape crisis counselor, Paulette Albosta, the court denied Appellant’s motion to compel.</p>

Appellant claimed that Albosta revealed confidential information to the Commonwealth’s medical expert, Dr. Thomas Novinger, who then based his diagnosis on such information. Appellant claimed that by disclosing this information to Dr. Novinger, the confidential information became available to the Commonwealth, thus constituting a waiver of the privilege. The Commonwealth claimed that it had not obtained any records from VRC and had not learned of any confidential communication between the victim and her rape counselor. After hearing argument from both parties, the trial court denied Appellant’s motion to compel. On appeal, Appellant claims that this ruling was in error since it denied him the constitutional right of cross-examination, confrontation, and compulsory process for obtaining witnesses. Appellant contends that he had a right to obtain the VRC records since they might contain exculpatory information.</p>
