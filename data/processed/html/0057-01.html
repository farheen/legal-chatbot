Low asserts that the property could be worth approximately $200,000 if title were cleared. Because Frances and Edmond Grady did not file an answer, the clerk entered a default judgment against them on November 4, 1991. Both the Spellmans and Low filed motions for a summary judgment. The court granted a summary judgment in favor of Low and denied the Spellmans’ motion. The court held that the agreement was void as violative of the rule against perpetuities. From that judgment the Spellmans appeal.</p>

The theory is that preemptive rights of first refusal that last perpetually, especially those that mandate sale for a specified sum, create such disincentive to sell the property that alienation is effectively restrained. We have said that the purpose of the rule against perpetuities is to “prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general.” <em>Eaton v. Miller, </em><a href="/a2d/250/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="250 A.2d 220" data-case-ids="8066262" data-case-paths="/a2d/250/0220-01">250 A.2d 220</a>, 226 (Me.1969). Such preemptive rights thus harbor the very evil that the rule against perpetuities seeks to redress. Once it is determined that preemptive <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>rights are subject to the rule against perpe-tuities, it can hardly be disputed that this specific provision violates the rule. The agreement is clear on its face that it is intended to apply not only to the original parties to the contract, but also to all of their heirs and assigns, thus running afoul of the rule against perpetuities.</p>
    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[193,664,748,832]]]'>It is likewise clear that this agreement violates the common law rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation. Not all restraints are unreasonable. One court has held that some of the factors to be considered in deciding whether a restraint is improper are 1) the purpose for which the restraint is imposed; 2) the duration of the restraint; and 3) the method of determining the price. <em>Hartnett v. Jones, </em><a href="/p2d/629/1357-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="629 P.2d 1357" data-case-ids="10441854" data-case-paths="/p2d/629/1357-01">629 P.2d 1357</a>, 1363 (Wyo.1981). Here it is clear that the duration of the restraint is perpetual and the agreement sets a fixed price. The purpose of the restraint is less clear. There is no evidence, however, that the Gradys sold the property for less than they paid for it or for less than the market value at the time of sale.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[194,1524,745,316]]]'>In the absence of a purpose justifying restraint, the other two factors make a strong case for concluding that this agreement creates an unreasonable restraint on alienation. A fixed price has a tendency to impose a serious restraint. It has been said that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.6",109,[231,1861,710,744]]]'>If the pre-emptive right requires that the property be offered at much less than its value at the time of the proposed sale, there is an obvious check upon alienation, since the owner will retain the property rather than sell it at a great sacrifice. Any pre-emption exercisable at a fixed price is likely to involve sacrifice to the person bound to offer it, since a fixed price is usually based upon the value of the property when the pre-emptive provision is executed. It might be held, therefore, that any pre-emption fixing a price without reference to future increase in value is void as a restraint upon alienation in substance.</blockquote>

    <p id="b109-8" data-blocks='[["BL_109.8",109,[988,266,750,1127]]]'>The Spellmans, however, rely on a recent Vermont case to support their proposition that this particular restraint is not unreasonable. That case dealt with a right of first refusal at a fixed price of $500 for property with a market value of $90,000. <em>Colby v. Colby, </em><a href="/vt/157/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="596 A.2d 901" data-case-ids="4823186" data-case-paths="/vt/157/0233-01">596 A.2d 901</a> (Vt.1990). The court held that the restraint was reasonable under the circumstances because it was doubtful that the original transaction would have occurred but for the restraint. Thus the provision initially encouraged alienation. <em><a href="/vt/157/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="596 A.2d 901" data-case-ids="4823186" data-case-paths="/vt/157/0233-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/vt/157/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="596 A.2d 901" data-case-ids="4823186" data-case-paths="/vt/157/0233-01">at 904</a>. The Spellmans’ contention that the instant transaction would not have occurred but for the preemptive right retained, however, is mere speculation. There is no evidence that the Gradys preconditioned their purchase and resale of the property on the retention of the right. It is clear only that for whatever reason, the right of first refusal was a part of their agreement. That is not enough to take the provision out of the category of an unreasonable restraints on alienation.</p>
