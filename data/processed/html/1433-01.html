    <p id="b752-7" data-blocks='[["BL_752.8",752,[243,717,1321,149]]]'>The opposer, appellant, based its opposition upon the use, by it and its predecessors, of its registered trade-mark <em>“ </em>Oxydol,” since-June 10, 1914, as a trade-mark on soap powder.</p>

    <p id="b752-9" data-blocks='[["BL_752.10",752,[242,1017,1322,448]]]'>Opposer’s 'merchandise, <em>“ </em>soap powder,” is in powdered form and adapted for various cleaning purposes, such as laundry, kitchen,, and other household uses. It is put up in rectangular paper boxes, about 8 inches high and 5 inches wide, by 2 inches thick, and has-displayed prominently thereon the word <em>“ </em>Oxydol ” and the representation of a girl. On opposer’s package it is stated: “ It is neither a soap powder nor a powdered soap in the understanding of those terms, but it is a complete detergent that may be used for any purpose for which soap or soap powder is used.”</p>
    <p id="b752-10" data-blocks='[["BL_752.11",752,[241,1472,1321,494]]]'>The applicant’s mark consists of the word <em>“ </em>Oxol ” in large letters upon a frame or scroll, together with the representation of a girl holding a cloth. The applicant, on its container, says that there are nine hundred ninety-nine uses for “ Oxol ” in every home, and that among such uses are those of bleaching clothes, removing stains,, and cleaning household articles (such as bathtubs, sinks, washbasins, linoleum, drain boards, and so forth), and that it is used as a sterilizer. On the package it is recommended for cutting grease, for whitening clothes and for deodorizing. “ Oxol ” is put up in bottles about 8 inches high by 3 inches in diameter.</p>
    <p id="b752-11" data-blocks='[["BL_752.12",752,[241,1974,1320,330]]]'>The record shows that during the year prior to the date of applicant’s filing its application, the opposer spent $600,000 in advertising its product “ Oxydol,” and that the applicant, the J. L. Prescott Co., was and is a large concern manufacturing a great number of household products; that shortly before it filed its application it decided to extend its line to include the article with which we are herein concerned.</p>

Second, if the goods are of the same descriptive properties, are the marks so similar as to be likely to bring about confusion,, under the circumstances shown ?</p>
    <p id="b753-3" data-blocks='[["BL_753.4",753,[58,372,1323,195]]]'>The record shows that the goods are used, in part, for identical purposes.

    <p id="b753-6" data-blocks='[["BL_753.7",753,[62,923,1323,242]]]'>The goods, being to some extent dissimilar in appearance and use, and the marks not being identical, the examiner of interferences and the Commissioner of Patents concluded that there was no likelihood of confusion. In a case of this kind this question, of course, is largely a matter of opinion.</p>
    <p id="b753-7" data-blocks='[["BL_753.8",753,[10,1170,1375,343]]]'>We are of the opinion that there is a strong probability that confusion as to origin of the goods would result to the purchasing public in event both marks were registered, and were used in the manner shown in the record. At least there is some substantial doubt on the question, and under the familiar rule, such doubt I should be resolved against the newcomer, inasmuch as he has a wide field to select from in choosing his trade-mark.</p>
    <p id="b753-8" data-blocks='[["BL_753.9",753,[41,1520,1344,489]]]'>It was admitted in argument before this court that the applicant, deliberately selected the mark “ Oxol ” after considering the legal effect of doing so, in view of the registered trade-mark “ Oxydol,”' and while applicant does not admit that it selected “ Oxol ” with • the purpose of profiting by the advertisement and good will of the “ Oxydol ” trade-mark, there is no attempt at explanation as to why the word “ Oxol ” was' adopted, and it seems fair to infer that, owing to the peculiar character of the two arbitrary marks, and in the absence of any explanation whatever, applicant sought to profit by the confusion that would result.</p>

    <blockquote id="b754-4" data-blocks='[["BL_754.4",754,[279,323,1319,657]]]'>Of course, if confusion or mistóte is not likely to result from the use of the two marks, the motive of the later applicant in adopting its mark can not affect its right to registration; hut if, in the adoption and use of the mark, there be a purpose of confusing the mind of the public as to the origin of the goods to which it is applied, we have a right, in determining the question of likelihood of confusion or mistake, to consider the. motive in adopting the mark as indicating an opinion, upon the part of one vitally interested, that confusion or mistake would likely result from use of the mark. After all, the determination of the question of likelihood of confusion or mistake in the use of trade-marks must, as a general rule, be a matter of opinion and not the result of testimony produced as to the existence or absence of such confusion. Therefore the tribunals of the Patent Office, and this court as a reviewing body, may, in cases where one adopts and uses a mark with the motive of confusing the mind of the public, consider that motive as one of the factors in determining the question of whether use of such mark is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public.</blockquote>
