    <p id="b442-5" data-blocks='[["BL_442.6",442,[176,551,758,1382]]]'>At approximately 8:45 p.m. on April 10, 2006, Officer Keith Shyers of the Harrington Police Department arrived at a home on New Street, Harrington, Delaware to serve warrants in a drug investigation. After faffing to make contact with the individuals, Officer Shyers returned to his patrol car,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> intent on obtaining a search warrant for the residence. As Officer Shyres backed out of the driveway of the home and into the intersection of New and Thorpe Streets, the Defendant, Vernon Heath, brought his vehicle, a black Chrysler 300, to a stop before the driveway to allow the officer’s car onto the roadway. Upon making eye contact with the Defendant, Officer Shyres rolled down his window, and inquired whether the Defendant was turning onto New Street, which Officer Shyers testified he knew to be a high drug area of Harrington. The Defendant responded that he was headed “around the corner” toward Clark Street.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The conversation then ended. Defendant continued on Thorpe Street making a left-hand turn onto East Street, which intersects with Clark Street.</p>
    <p id="b442-6" data-blocks='[["BL_442.7",442,[175,1967,753,241]],["BL_442.8",442,[982,231,751,925]]]'>Upon seeing the tags to the Defendant’s vehicle, Officer Shyres ran the registration on his in-car computer, and noted that the vehicle came back to a Bridgeville or Greenwood address. He testified that this information aroused his suspicions, because these two towns are south of Harrington, whereas the Defendant’s intended course took him north. The officer doubled back to follow the Defendant, encountering him before the Defendant made the left-hand turn from East Street onto Clark Street. The officer continued his pursuit as the Defendant made the turn onto Clark Street, passing both Ward Street and Delaware Avenue. As the Defendant crossed the Conrail railroad tracks that intersect Clark Street, he activated his left turn signal, turning south onto Hanley Street. Officer Shyers then activated his emergency equipment. In response, the Defendant pulled his vehicle over to the side of Hanley Street.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b442-10" data-blocks='[["BL_442.9",442,[977,1189,754,1019]]]'>In the affidavit of probable cause, Officer Shyres stated the reason for the stop was the Defendant’s violation of 21 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 4155(b), which states that “[a] signal of intention to turn or move right or left when required shall be given continuously during not less than the last 300 feet or more than one-half mile traveled by the vehicle before turning.” According to Officer Shyres, the Defendant signaled for approximately 20 to 30 feet prior to turning left onto Hanley Street. Officer Shyres proceeded to make a traffic violation stop, though he admitted on cross-examination at the suppression hearing that his additional purpose in stopping the vehicle was to investigate whether the Defendant or his passenger were connected with the warrants the officer had attempted to serve on New Street.</p>

      <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>Officer Shyres approached the vehicle, and requested the Defendant’s license, registration, and insurance. During this initial contact with the Defendant, the officer noticed the Defendant’s eyes were bloodshot. The officer stated, however, that the Defendant did not appear nervous or confused or under any substance influence. Additionally, Officer Shyres observed many air fresheners hanging from the handles in the ceiling of the backseat of the Defendant’s vehicle. Based on training Officer Shyres received in drug interdiction courses, he testified that several air fresheners can be used as a masking agent to hide the bouquet of certain controlled substances. The testimony did not make mention of the actual number of ah’ fresheners in the backseat, or whether any were hanging from the rear-view mirror. When Officer Shyres spoke to the Defendant, he did not notice any odor emanating from the air fresheners, nor did he notice an odor of alcohol, marijuana or other controlled substance associated with the Defendant or coming from the car.</p>
    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.6",443,[182,1581,755,1065]],["BL_443.7",443,[982,240,755,352]]]'>At this point, at the Officer’s request, the Defendant produced his license. Officer Shyres returned to his vehicle to run the Defendant’s license through the computer system. The license was valid, and the Defendant had no active warrants. Although the Defendant was later charged with Failure to Have Registration Card in Possession and Failure to Have Insurance Identification in Possession, the officer testified he was unsure if the Defendant provided either the registration or proof of insurance. Despite the confusion on this issue, the officer knew, from having previously run the tag number, that the vehicle was properly registered to a person in Bridgeville or Greenwood, who the officer would later discover was the Defendant’s sister. In addition, while the Defendant’s passenger, who of course was not driving, was unable to produce a driver’s license, he did provide Officer Shyres with his name, permitting the officer to confirm the passenger’s identity, and to determine the absence of any warrants for his arrest. During this time, Office Longski arrived on the scene to assist Officer Shyres with the traffic stop.</p>
    <p id="b443-7" data-blocks='[["BL_443.8",443,[982,631,754,551]]]'>Instead of issuing the Defendant a citation for the traffic offenses for which he was stopped, allowing him to continue on his way, Officer Shryres asked the Defendant out of the car to conduct what he termed a “road side investigation.” At the suppression hearing, Officer Shyres was asked if this continued investigation had anything to do with the Defendant’s alleged failure to signal. He responded that it did not.</p>
    <p id="b443-8" data-blocks='[["BL_443.9",443,[981,1230,756,136]]]'>Later in his testimony he stated that he would not have stopped the Defendant had a traffic violation not been committed.</p>

That, he stated, was his usual practice. At the suppression hearing, Officer Shyres testified that his statement at the preliminary hearing that he never had any indication that either the Defendant or his passenger was armed was true. Once the pat down was completed, Officer Shyres then began questioning the Defendant as to his business abroad and destination. The Defendant replied that he was returning home to Greenwood (which is south of the detention site) after an evening at the Midway Slots where he had won $300 to $400. Officer Shyres believed this story to be implausible because the Defendant was “traveling north” and Hanley Street was not the most direct route out of town. The Defendant responded that he always drove through Harrington in order to get home. In addition, the Defendant stated that he had just dropped off a friend nearby, al<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>though he could not provide a name or the location. Officer Shyres stated that he was suspicious of even the Defendant’s story regarding his visit to Midway Slots, because the <em>passenger </em>was 19 years old, and one must be 21 in order to enter the slot parlors. The exchange ended. Officer Shyres had the Defendant stand between his police vehicle and Officer Long-ski’s vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[185,759,753,703]]]'>Next, Officer Shyres asked the passenger to step out of the vehicle. He then immediately conducted a pat down search. During the search, the officer felt a large soft item in his top right pocket. The passenger stated it was cigarettes, but the officer did not believe it felt like cigarettes. Officer Shyres reached in the passenger’s pocket, and retrieved 29 sandwich bags containing a green leafy substance which later testing revealed to be marijuana. The passenger was immediately arrested and placed in the backseat of Officer Shyres’s patrol car.</p>

Consent was granted. Officer Longski conducted the search, discovering a small white chunky substance on the rear floor behind the driver’s seat, which field-tested positive as cocaine. The Defendant was placed in Officer Longski’s patrol car. Both the Defendant and passenger were transported to the Harrington Police Department. Upon arriving at the station, the Defendant was placed in an interrogation room. The two officers watched on closed circuit television as the Defendant placed an unidentifiable item into the garbage can. The Defendant then placed a gum wrapper in the can, pushed both items to the bottom, and urinated in the can. The officers then placed the Defendant in a holding cell, and searched the garbage can. The search revealed what later field-tested positive as 18 grams of cocaine. Officer Shyres stated that the interrogation room is cleaned on Sundays and Wednesdays. This occurred on a Monday night. According to the testimony, no one else had been in the room before the Defendant.</p>

    <p id="b444-10" data-blocks='[["BL_444.10",444,[985,953,753,1032]]]'>Defendant moves to suppress all evidence obtained by the State as a result of Officer Shyres’s traffic stop and subsequent search of his vehicle. The Defendant asserts two bases to support his motion. First, he takes the position that the initial traffic stop was effected for the purpose of conducting an otherwise illegal search, in which event Article I, Section 6 of the Delaware Constitution prohibits police officers from making such a “pretextual stop.” Second, he claims that, even if the initial stop were held valid, the subsequent detention and search exceeded the permissible bounds of a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Further, Defendant asserts that his consent did not serve as a cure, because it was a product of the original unlawful seizure.</p>

Thus, the State argues, the initial stop and search were legal. Additionally, the State argues that Officer Shyres in fact possessed reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Hence, the State <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>says, the subsequent investigation and search were constitutionally valid.</p>

    <p id="b445-8" data-blocks='[["BL_445.9",445,[176,1153,751,716]]]'>The Defendant first argues that the initial traffic stop effectuated by Officer Shyres violates Article I, Section 6 of the Delaware Constitution of 1897, on the theory that our constitution prohibits searches based on purely pretextual traffic stops. The State responds that our constitution, like the federal constitution, finds nothing inherently suspect with such a process. Furthermore, the State urges this Court to adopt the U.S. Supreme Court’s rationale in <em>Whren </em>when considering Article I, Section 6 to assess the legality of these stops under our constitution.</p>

One commentator has defined a “pretextual stop” as “a traffic stop that occurs when an officer has probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that a motorist has violated a traffic law, but which the officer would not have made absent a desire, not supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion, to investigate a more serious offense.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> For example, such a stop can arise when an officer observes a vehicle driving 26 miles per hour in a 25 m.p.h. zone, has some subjective reason to suspect that the vehicle is involved in the drug trade, and uses this minor violation of the traffic laws to investigate his hunch further. Despite the fact that a traffic stop certainly is less intrusive than the search of a home, such a stop is not a mere inconvenience. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Courts of our state have repeatedly stated that a traffic stop constitutes a seizure of a vehicle and its occupants under the (U.S.) Fourth Amendment, and presumably under (Delaware’s) Article I, Section 6.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The U.S. Supreme Court has held that such seizure is valid when supported by reasonable articulable suspicion, as defined in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>and is supported by probable cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> While the <em>Whren </em>decision is asserted to hold that the officer’s possession of probable cause for the stop is sufficient to end the Fourth <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>Amendment inquiry, the Defendant maintains that purely pretextual stops present a unique danger that Article I, Section 6 was enacted to address, and that the mere existence of original pretextual probable cause does not end the inquiry.</p>

This unbridled discretion gives rise to the danger of arbitrary police action. That, the Defendant argues, is precisely demonstrated in this case by the arbitrary nature of the traffic violation he is charged with committing. While the <em>Whren </em>Court arguably did not find the arbitrariness of these stops offensive to the Fourth Amendment, the Defendant believes Delaware’s Declaration of Rights requires a different result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

The Defendant supports his position by citing Officer Shyres’s testimony at the preliminary hearing, and later the suppression hearing, which demonstrated that he lacked reasonable suspicion of non-traffic criminal activity.

Officer Shyres did not contend that he had an independent basis to believe criminal activity was afoot. He candidly admitted, for example, that he did not have any previous encounters with the Defendant or have an informant who tipped him off about the Defendant’s current criminal activity. Instead, Officer Shyres essentially possessed only a mere hunch about the Defendant’s criminal activity. This is supported by the officer’s own suppression hearing testimony, in which he stated that one of the reasons he stopped the Defendant was to continue the “investigation” of the Defendant’s reason for driving near New Street, and to ascertain whether the Defendant or his passenger had been involved in the drug investigation the officer was serving warrants in on New Street. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Harris v.

Officer Shyres’ testimony at the suppression hearing raised doubt as to whether 300 feet even existed between Ward Street and Hanley Street for the Defendant to signal his intention to turn. Indeed, other than Officer Shyres being behind the Defendant, no evidence suggests that anyone was in the area even to see a signal. Nevertheless, the Defendant did, in fact signal prior to executing his turn. While the signal lasted for less than 300 feet, so too did Clark Street last for less than 300 feet.

When the officer frisked and handcuffed the defendant, the officer had observed only three relevant facts: (1) the defendant’s movement of his right arm as he pulled over; (2) the defendant’s apparent nervousness and perspiration; and (3) the defendant’s implausible assertion that he did not know the name of his passenger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_72" id="ref_footnote_1_72">72</a> Based on the totality of even those circumstances, the Court did not believe that the facts, standing alone, could justify the second detention or the “intrusive measures like the pat-down search and the officer’s use of handcuffs.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_73" id="ref_footnote_1_73">73</a>

Officer Shyres returned to his vehicle to run the Defendant’s license. The Defendant’s license was valid, and he had no active warrants. Rather than question the Defendant on his lack of insurance or registration or even issue the Defendant a citation for these traffic offenses, Officer Shyres asked Defendant to exit the vehicle, performed a pat-down, asked questions regarding the Defendant’s business abroad, and then had him stand at the rear of his vehicle with Officer Longski. Under 11 Del. C. § 1902 Officer Shyres is empowered to question the Defendant about his “name, address, business abroad, and destination,” because the officer had reasonable ground to suspect the Defendant had violated a traffic regulation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_79" id="ref_footnote_1_79">79</a> Further, under the Fourth Amendment, an officer may order both the driver and the passengers to exit the car during the course of a valid traffic stop.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_80" id="ref_footnote_1_80">80</a> However, because Officer Shyres’ actions and stated intent upon returning to the Defendant’s vehicle were unrelated to the traffic violation, it becomes clear that at this point the traffic stop ended and a second, independent investigative detention has begun.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_81" id="ref_footnote_1_81">81</a> Therefore, for this Court to uphold the subsequent seizure and search, Officer Shyres must have possessed reasonable articulable suspicion to support his action.</p>

First, as made clear earlier in this opinion, the Delaware Supreme Court has labeled the police claim of a “high drug area” a “familiar mantra,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_82" id="ref_footnote_1_82">82</a> and has held that reasonable suspicion “cannot be based on a defendant’s presence in a particular neighborhood at a particular time of day with no independent evidence that the defendant has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_83" id="ref_footnote_1_83">83</a> In this case, nei<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>ther the State nor Officer Shyres presented any evidence at the suppression hearing that supported the blanket statement that this was a high drug area.

The Court does not believe that this Defendant’s bloodshot eyes can be a basis for reasonable suspicion. This is not to say that bloodshot eyes can never be probative of criminal activity. For example, if the Defendant’s bloodshot eyes were combined with an odor of drugs or alcohol, a more persuasive argument might exist. However, bloodshot eyes can “result from a variety of non-criminal circumstances, such as tiredness, allergies, or just rubbing of the eyes.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_84" id="ref_footnote_1_84">84</a> When this stop occurred, it was night, and there was no evidence that the Defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

However, Officer Shyres did not begin to question the Defendant until after he had ordered him out of the car, and performed a pat-down. While the Defendant’s response to these questions may have been illogical, the State’s attempt to argue that these statements were part of the reasonable suspicion, necessary to support a subsequent detention, when they were elicited after the subsequent detention began, is similarly specious. Subsequently obtained evidence is not permitted to justify a prior seizure and search. Because this type of evidence is not allowed, those statements cannot be part of the totality of the circumstances supporting the subsequent detention. Additionally, the <em>Caldwell </em>Court stated in a footnote that “[m]ost courts require something more than nervousness and implausible or conflicting answers to support a finding of reasonable suspicion — for example, insufficient documentation or the odor of masking agents.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_85" id="ref_footnote_1_85">85</a> While the Defendant was not able to provide Officer Shyres with his insurance card or the vehicle’s registration, that does not provide the “something more” necessary to support the subsequent detention, particularly given the presence of his license. Officer Shyres performed a registration cheek pri- or to pulling the Defendant over. He already knew the vehicle was properly registered and not reported stolen. Also, the officer was not concerned with the Defendant’s lack of insurance or registration; he did not make further inquires into the absence of either, and specifically stated in the suppression hearing that upon his return to Defendant’s car, his sole concern was further investigating the Defendant’s connection with the warrants he attempted to serve on New Street.</p>

However, the officer did not take note of how many air fresheners were in the backseat, and also did not note if any were hanging elsewhere in the car. He did not report being overcome by the smell of air fresheners. The mere presence of several air fresheners in the backseat of the Defendant’s car is insufficient by itself, to differentiate this Defendant from the large body of innocent air-freshener user drivers, or to lead a reasonable officer to conclude that drug activity was afoot.</p>

Earlier in this opinion, the Court referenced the standard set out in <em>Caldwell </em>for a valid pat down. As noted previously, a claim of “officer safety” is not talismanic. While, after a lawful investigative stop supported by reasonable suspicion, an officer has “a right to <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>conduct a limited search of the suspect for dangerous weapons,” the officer must possess a reasonable belief that the detainee is presently armed and dangerous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_90" id="ref_footnote_1_90">90</a> The reasonable belief or suspicion must be directed at the person to be frisked.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_91" id="ref_footnote_1_91">91</a> Simply “allowing pat down searches ... as a matter of routine practice, without other attendant circumstances, would eviscerate Terry’s requirement that the pat down be based on particularized suspicion developed by the officer with respect to each individual suspect.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_92" id="ref_footnote_1_92">92</a> Officer Shyres cannot meet the standard laid out in Caldwell, for he cannot articulate any reasons that led him to believe that either the Defendant or his passenger was armed. In fact, Officer Shyres testified both at the preliminary hearing and at the suppression hearing that he never had any reason to believe that the Defendant or his passenger possessed any weapon. Officer Shyres’s sole basis for the pat down was that it was his habit automatically to conduct a pat down of a subject when he is going to question him. The case law is clear that pat downs must be supported by some reasonable suspicion, rather than mere habit. Therefore, not only did Officer Shyres lack reasonable suspicion for the subsequent detention, but also he cannot justify the pat down and detention on the grounds of officer safety. Again, the Court concludes that the evidence at issue must be suppressed.</p>

In this case, for example, the block of the street from which Defendant turned was less than 300 feet in length. One can hypothesize a situation where someone turned right on to that block, intending to turn left at the end of it. In order to comply with the “300 feet” signal distance for his left turn, he would have to engage the turn signal before he even turned right on to the street. As inane a scenario as that presents, it would be the only way to show a left turn signal 300 feet ahead of the point of the turn to comply with the literal requirements of the statute, which requirements are being utilized here to justify the stop.</p>
