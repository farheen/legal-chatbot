Doral II consists of one hundred twenty-two (122) condominiums in seven two-story buildings. Each two-story building is divided into sections of four condominium units, two on the first floor and two on the second floor. The Zaslow’s had a second floor unit.</p>

In May 1997, Muriel Zaslow returned home. She was confined to a wheelchair and received care from visiting nurses and her husband. Because she required kidney dialysis, she had to be transported to the hospital three times per week by ambulance. The ambulance attendants strapped her into a collapsible chair and carried her down the steps. To go anywhere, Muriel Zaslow had to be carried. Not long after the ambulance trips began, the insurance company notified Zaslow that reimbursement of the ambulance transport expenses was uncertain.</p>

He explored the feasibility of installing a chairlift in the common area stairway outside his unit. Zaslow offered to pay all costs of installation. He received the consent of the owners of the three other condominium units in the building.

The Doral II board denied his request. Letter, June 19, 1997; R.R. at 374a. Zaslow advised Doral II by letter, June 21, 1997, that the action was discriminatory and threatened legal action. Letter, June 21, 1997; R.R. at 375a. Zas-low did not pursue the matter further until the general association meeting on October 6, 1997. At the meeting, Zaslow informed the members that he wanted to install a chairlift and that he would be financially responsible. Notes of Testimony, March 7, 2000, (N.T) at 70; R.R. at 70a.

Frequently, the Board of Building Standards has granted variances in situations similar to Zaslow’s. (F.F. Nos. 61, 62.) “Some of the criteria <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>reviewed.. .would be the number of units affected (here one unit); the number of persons living there (again, one person); and the number of persons who could live in an affected area.” (F.F. No. 63.) All of the evidence presented by Doral II pertaining to the alleged building code violation and safety risks posed by installation of the chairlift came in the form of Kobe-lin’s expert testimony. It is further observed that the Commission specifically <em>discredited </em>Kobelin’s testimony upon which the majority opinion is based. Commission Opinion at 22. The Commission specifically found that “[t]he information provided to Doral II’s board by Mr. Kobe-lin can only be described as sorely lacking and incomplete. The reality of the situation is that Mr. Kobelin’s report either inadvertently or possibly intentionally omitted critical information.” Commission Opinion at 22.</p>

No. 64.) As fact finder, the Commission is the sole arbiter of credibility and this Court should not disturb such determinations on appeal. <em>Vending Distributors v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, </em>162 Pa.Cmwlth. 602, <a href="/pa-commw/162/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="639 A.2d 953" data-case-ids="1458232,7866270" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/162/0602-01,/a2d/639/0953-01">639 A.2d 953</a>, 956 (1994). I have to conclude that Smith’s credited testimony, together with the credited testimony of Zas-low’s other witnesses when considered in conjunction with statements contained in Doral II’s denial notices, provide ample substantial evidence to support the Commission’s determination that Doral II failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for Muriel Zaslow’s disability as required under § 5(h)(3.1) and (3.2) of the PHRA. 43 P.S. § 955(h)(3.1)(3.2). There is no substantial evidence to support the majority’s decision which seemingly makes its own credibility decisions, crediting Kobelin after the Board discredited him.</p>
    <p id="b652-6" data-blocks='[["BL_652.6",652,[995,569,751,1288]]]'>The majority decision is entirely based upon a declaration that the Commission committed an error of law when it determined that a reasonable accommodation for a person so handicapped would have been for Doral II to have granted permission for the chairlift to be installed conditional upon Zaslow obtaining the variance necessary to comply with the building Code. How such consent can be construed as an unreasonable accommodation by the majority is mystifying. If the consent were given and the variance obtained, a very sick elderly lady would have been helped to enjoy her last days with the full consent of her neighbors. To withhold that consent, Doral was acting in an arbitrary manner based solely on its past practice and its by-laws, which are a direct violation of Section 5(h)(3.2) of the PHRA, “[t]o refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices ... that may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a housing accommodation.”</p>
    <p id="b652-7" data-blocks='[["BL_652.7",652,[992,1884,751,812]]]'>The majority decision, in effect, repeals Section 5(h)(3.2) by upholding the rules and policies of Doral II in spite of the legislative mandate that Doral II cannot refuse to make a reasonable accommodation to a handicapped person by refusing to change its rules or policies. All Doral II had to do to make such reasonable accommodation was to consent to the chair lift if Zaslow could get the variance as his architect assured him. The majority cannot legislate judicially that a reasonable accommodation does not have to be made if it requires a person to change its rules or policies to permit a handicapped person to seek a variance.</p>
