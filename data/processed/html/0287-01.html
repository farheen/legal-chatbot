The issues raised on appeal are whether the trial court erred in allowing defendant City of Philadelphia’s (City) expert witness to testify that it was too speculative to come to a conclusion regarding causation of a trolley derailment that led to Smick’s injuries; whether the court correctly determined that a jury charge of res ipsa loquitur was not warranted; whether the trial court erred by failing to reinstruct the jury on concurrent negligence and instead reread the City’s stipulation; and whether the trial court correctly refused to rule on the issue of ownership of the trolley rail.</p>

Immediately after the accident, another trolley operator found that a three-foot section of the trolley rail had broken out. <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>Smick filed an action against the City alleging that the rail section broke due to a defect in the road and/or the road bed and that the City was negligent in permitting the existence of the defects.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Among other evidence, Smick presented the testimony of his expert, Judson F. Vodges HI, a registered professional engineer, who opined that lack of proper maintenance of the surface paving in the track area was a substantial factor in the cause of the rail breakage and the consequent trolley derailment. Vodges based his opinion on information obtained from SEPTA and on his physical examination of the site five years after Smick’s accident. Vodges admitted that he did not examine any part of the rail substructure and took no soil bor-ings. Further, he could not eliminate a fault in the rail or a bad weld as a cause of the accident nor could he directly rule out excessive trolley speed or the snowy, freezing weather conditions as factors.</p>

Fleisher, a civil engineer. Fleisher testified that a number of other factors could have caused the derailment, including improper rail manufacture or maintenance, weather, temperature, trolley speed, water coming up from the soil, bad rail welds, and constant trolley traffic. He opined that because of these factors, combined with the lack of the necessary evidence of the rail section itself, which had long since been replaced, it was too speculative to come to a conclusion regarding why the rail actually broke. Fleisher specifically refuted Vodg-es’ conclusions that failure to maintain the road bed caused the rail breakage, noting that one cannot make such a conclusion without examination of the rail, which could not be done. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the City. Smick filed a timely motion for post-trial relief raising the four issues noted above, which the trial court denied, and Smick appealed to this Court.</p>

In these cases, the Courts rejected expert opinion testimony that was based on mere possibilities and probabilities. These cases are inapplicable to the matter sub judice because they concerned equivocal expert causation testimony on behalf of the parties with the burden of proof. In the present matter, the City had no such burden and merely offered its testimony for purposes of rebuttal. Similarly, <em>Collins v. Hand, </em><a href="/pa/431/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="431 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1917403" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0378-01">431 Pa. 378</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20398" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="246 A.2d 398">246 A.2d 398</a> (1968), in which the Court held that an expert witness is not permitted to state an opinion based upon mere conjecture, is inapplicable because Fleisher did not base his opinion on conjecture.</p>

Also without merit is Smick's contention that Fleisher’s testimony undermined the substantive law on circumstantial evidence because it suggested to the jury that circumstantial inferences, which the jury might have drawn by accepting Vodges’ opinion, were improper and that Smick could only prevail if direct evidence were provided. This Court finds no evidence in the record to support Smick’s claim. Furthermore, the jury was properly instructed regarding the role of circumstantial evidence.</p>
