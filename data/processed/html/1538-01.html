    <p id="b722-14" data-blocks='[["BL_722.13",722,[210,1761,1121,401]]]'>Respondent, Linda Levine Weber Franco, was a registered nurse at Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, where appellant, Dr. R. D. Prabhu, also worked. On February 19, 1982, Ms. Franco went to see Dr. Prabhu and complained of weakness, fatigue, dizziness, light-headedness, palpitations, headaches, and episodes where she lost or almost lost consciousness. She denied having any problems with her vision or hearing. Dr. Prabhu initially believed that Ms. Franco could be suffering from mitral valve prolapse, cardiac arrhythmia, hypoglycemia, or hyperthyroidism.</p>
    <p id="b722-15" data-blocks='[["BL_722.14",722,[209,2168,1120,220]],["BL_723.1",723,[179,292,1123,223]]]'>From February 23 through February 25, 1982, Ms. Franco underwent testing at Valley Hospital at Dr. Prabhu’s direction. Dr. Prabhu characterized this testing as a complete workup; according to Ms. Franco, however, Dr. Prabhu negligently failed to order any type of neurological tests. At trial, Dr. Prabhu <a id="p1541" href="#p1541" data-label="1541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1541</a>testified that he did conduct neurologic tests by examining Ms. Franco’s eyes, glands and membranes. According to Dr. Prabhu, he found no signs of a neurological disorder that would warrant further testing. Dr. Prabhu also testified that Ms. Franco did not report any symptoms of neurological dysfunction.</p>
    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[180,520,1123,579]]]'>Ultimately, Dr. Prabhu found no source for Ms. Franco’s symptoms and diagnosed the problem as vasovagal attacks from low blood pressure. According to Ms. Franco, Dr. Prabhu informed her that all of her tests were normal and that she should reduce her caffeine intake. Dr. Prabhu testified that he instructed Ms. Franco to return if her symptoms worsened and suggested that she see an ear, nose and throat specialist because she had a sinus problem. Ms. Franco testified that Dr. Prabhu never suggested that she see another physician and never followed up on her condition after his initial diagnosis. Ms. Franco did see an ear, nose and throat specialist, who recommended that she have an X-ray study of her inner ear, but the X-ray was never performed.</p>
    <p id="b723-6" data-blocks='[["BL_723.5",723,[180,1115,1123,406]]]'>Prior to February 1982, Ms. Franco suffered “sick headaches” once every one or two weeks. Over the next seventeen months, the frequency of these headaches increased to two or three per week. In addition, during this time period, Ms. Franco suffered some hearing loss, more frequent dizzy spells, a loss of coordination and a deterioration in her handwriting. Her speech became so slurred that she was subjected to ridicule. In December 1982 or January 1983, Ms. Franco began developing severe vision problems at close distances.</p>
    <p id="b723-7" data-blocks='[["BL_723.6",723,[181,1526,1124,630]]]'>In July 1983, Ms. Franco saw a neurologist, Dr. Gerald Dunn, who performed a CAT scan and diagnosed the problem as an acoustic neuroma, a benign brain tumor. Ms. Franco then underwent four surgeries in July and August 1983, during which the tumor was removed. A neurosurgeon, Dr. Franco Erculei, performed the surgeries. After the surgeries, Ms. Franco could not walk, sit up, feed or bathe herself for three months. In addition, the surgeries left her with hearing loss and facial palsy, including the inability to close her left eyelid. From October 1984 to May 1986, Ms. Franco saw Dr. Robert Levine, an ophthalmologist, who performed five additional surgeries so that Ms. Franco’s eye could function. These surgeries included installing a spring to open and close the eyelid, a cornea transplant, and two laser surgeries.</p>
    <p id="b723-8" data-blocks='[["BL_723.7",723,[182,2160,1123,222]],["BL_724.1",724,[209,300,1121,352]]]'>Ms. Franco subsequently filed an action against Dr. Prabhu. At trial, Dr. Levine, the ophthalmologist, testified that, based upon his review of Dr. Prabhu’s records, Dr. Prabhu breached the standard of care because he should have found the tumor. In particular, Dr. Levine opined that Dr. Prabhu’s list of possible <a id="p1542" href="#p1542" data-label="1542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1542</a>causes was not sufficient and that, based on Ms. Franco’s symptoms, Dr. Prabhu should have performed a general neurologic examination and should have ordered a neurologic consultation while Ms. Franco was undergoing her battery of tests. Additionally, another physician, Dr. Scott Deppe, testified that Dr. Prabhu breached the standard of care because he failed to perform a neurologic exam and did not consider any further neurologic workup.</p>
    <p id="b724-5" data-blocks='[["BL_724.4",724,[209,660,1121,217]]]'>Dr. Dunn, who found the tumor, and Dr. David Freeman, a neurosurgeon retained as an expert by Dr. Prabhu, opined that Dr. Prabhu did not breach the standard of care. Both Dr. Levine and Dr. Freeman testified that if Dr. Prabhu had ordered a CAT scan, he would have found the tumor.</p>
    <p id="b724-6" data-blocks='[["BL_724.5",724,[204,887,1124,946]]]'>Dr. Erculei testified that the tumor he removed from Ms. Franco’s brain was about 3.5 centimeters in diameter. The experts agreed that this was a medium-sized tumor, since a tumor less than 2.0 centimeters in diameter is considered small, and a tumor greater than 4.0 centimeters in diameter is considered large. Dr. Levine testified that in general, the larger the tumor, the greater the resulting damage will be upon the tumor’s removal. He opined that if the tumor had been small, Ms. Franco probably would have had less facial paralysis and would not have needed the additional eye surgeries. According to Dr. Levine, acoustic neuroma patients with tumors of approximately two centimeters or less rarely require additional surgery after removal, and the vast majority of those patients suffer no postoperative facial paralysis. In addition, Dr. Levine testified that those patients who suffer post-operative facial paralysis from small tumors have a better chance for recovery than patients with medium or large tumors. Dr. Freeman testified that if a tumor is caught very early, facial nerve paralysis might be avoided. Dr. Erculei, however, testified that Ms. Franco probably would have sustained the same nerve damage even if the surgery had been performed in February 1982.</p>
    <p id="b724-7" data-blocks='[["BL_724.6",724,[203,1839,1123,539]]]'>No doctor could give an opinion as to the probable size of the tumor when Ms. Franco went to Dr. Prabhu in February 1982. Drs. Prabhu, Levine, Erculei and Freeman did testify that tumors grow over time and produce increasing pressure on adjacent brain structures. Additionally, Dr. Levine opined that the growth of acoustic neuroma tumors over time results in blurred vision but that this blurred vision does not occur until tumors reach the medium size range — two centimeters in diameter — or larger. In a study performed by Dr. Levine, 34 percent of tumor patients suffering from vision problems had medium sized tumors, and 64.5 percent had large tumors. No patient with a small tumor suffered any vision problems.</p>

The jury also found that Ms. Franco’s contributory negligence was forty percent, and the final judgment was reduced by this amount. Ms. Franco’s final award was $798,600, plus interest, for a total judgment of $950,000.</p>
    <p id="b725-5" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[157,667,1122,496]]]'>On appeal, Dr. Prabhu contends that (1) Ms. Franco did not present adequate evidence of causation; (2) two of the jury instructions were contradictory and therefore confused the jury; (3) Dr. Levine’s testimony regarding matters other than his treatment of Ms. Franco should have been excluded because he was not designated as an expert witness; (4) the court erred in admitting a pamphlet and textbook chapter written by Dr. Levine because they were inflammatory and prejudicial; and (5) the amount of the jury’s award shocks the conscience. We conclude that none of Dr. Prabhu’s assignments of error has merit and accordingly affirm the judgment.</p>

In particular, he discussed Ms. Franco's brow droop, inability to close her left eye, and problems with her cornea. Dr. Levine explained that he surgically opened her eyelids, which had been sewn together, revised the eyelid margins, and implanted a palpe-bral spring to allow the lids to close. In addition, Dr. Levine performed surgery on Ms. Franco's damaged cornea. Later in his testimony, Dr. Levine explained that post-operative complications and recovery are directly related to tumor size and that according to a statistical study that he performed, patients with small tumors rarely have post-operative facial paralysis, but patients with larger tumors frequently suffer such paralysis. In addition, Dr. Levine testified that patients with tumors smaller <a id="p1549" href="#p1549" data-label="1549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1549</a>than two centimeters generally do not suffer from pre-operative vision problems.</p>

Specifically, they were not offered to prove that Dr. Prabhu’s lack of diagnosis increased the harm to Ms. Franco or to show the damages suffered by Ms. Franco as a result of the tumor’s size. As a consequence, the hearsay exception delineated in NRS 51.255 did not apply with regard to these portions of the chapter.
