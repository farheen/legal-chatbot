Those foundational requirements include that the material constitute a 'statement’ ... and that the statement relate to the subject matter of the witness’ direct testimony.” <em><a href="/a2d/638/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="638 A.2d 698" data-case-ids="7366632" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0698-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/638/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="638 A.2d 698" data-case-ids="7366632" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0698-01">at 704-05</a> (citations omitted). The government takes that pronouncement out of context, however, for we immediately went on to explain in <em>Hilliard </em>that in order to obviate the need for <em>in camera </em>inspection, of potential Jencks material, ”[i]t is only <em>required </em>that the court have before it a sufficient basis to determine that the statements are <em>not </em>Jencks.” <em><a href="/a2d/638/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="638 A.2d 698" data-case-ids="7366632" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0698-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/638/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="638 A.2d 698" data-case-ids="7366632" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0698-01">at 705</a> (emphasis added).. We held that testimony from the maker of the missing document about its contents can be "an adequate basis” on which to make that determination without the need for inspection of the document itself. <em><a href="/a2d/638/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="638 A.2d 698" data-case-ids="7366632" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0698-01">Id.</a> </em>In the instant case, however, the police officer who interviewed the complaining witness did not testify, and the trial court did not have any evidentiary basis on which it reasonably could have determined that the missing notes were not a producible Jencks statement (nor, in fact, did the trial court purport to make such a determination).</p>
