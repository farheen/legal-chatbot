    <p id="b173-16" data-blocks='[["BL_173.20",173,[104,1129,1324,438]]]'>The appeal and cross appeal herein arise from interference proceedings in the Patent Office, which involved six counts relating to a continuous cooker of the type wherein cans containing vegetables, milk, etc., are moved in a continuous stream from one end of a single unit or tank to another, being passed through a heated body of water, the particular invention involved relating to the division of the apparatus into a plurality of heating zones, the complete cooking of the contents of the cans being performed in the single units or tank referred to.</p>

    <p id="b174-9" data-blocks='[["BL_174.9",174,[239,1842,1326,542]]]'>The issues herein, for the most part, involve the question as to whether or not Thompson’s application in 1921 disclosed tank partitions. It is urged by Thompson that said application did disclose said partitions in the tank, although no definite claim was made therefor. Both tribunals below concur in the view that said application did not disclose such partitions, and having found the evidence insufficient to prove a conception and reduction to practice earlier, than Chapman’s conceded dates, priority was, as to counts 2, o, and 6 (which involved- the partitions) awarded to Chapman. Counts 1, 3, and 4 were regarded as not claiming for partitions and priority as to them was awarded to Thompson.</p>
    <p id="b175-2" data-blocks='[["BL_175.3",175,[101,228,1326,443]]]'>
      <a id="p725" href="#p725" data-label="725" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*725</a>The examiner of interferences, in considering and construing the evidence on behalf of Thompson, which was offered for the purpose of establishing a conception date of the subject matter of counts 2, 5, and 6 earlier than the conceded record date of conception and reduction to practice of Chapman, stated in substance that even if the evidence could be said to establish such conception on the part of Thompson, Chapman should prevail as to counts 2, 5, and 6 for the reason that he had not been diligent, since admittedly he did not actually reduce to practice before June, 1923.</p>
    <p id="b175-3" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[106,680,1322,443]]]'>There was much testimony taken by both sides which was carefully considered by the examiner of interferences and by the examiners in chief. Both tribunals regarded the testimony on the part of Thompson as not fixing a date which would justify his claim for priority on counts 2, 5, and 6, and that none of the testimony or other record facts in the case warranted giving priority of the subject matter covered by counts 1, 3, and 4 to Chapman. So, as we view it, the tribunals below have decided the cáse upon the record facts aside from any testimony.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[105,1131,1325,444]]]'>We have examined the evidence with considerable care and we can not arrive at any other conclusion than that arrived at by the tribunals below. An examination of the Thompson disclosure, which is his application of 1921, convinces us that no partitions' of the kind claimed in counts 2, 5, and 6 were therein disclosed. We conclude, therefore, that the decision of the Board of Appeals; awarding priority of invention to Thompson as t’o counts 1, 3, and 4 and to Chapman as to counts 2, 5, and 6, was not against the weight of the evidence and was not clearly erroneous and, therefore, is <em>affirmed.</em>
