The judgments were based on Smith’s failure to meet the notice requirements of the Maine Tort Claims Act. 14 M.R.S.A. §§ <em>8101-8118 (1980 &amp; </em>Supp.1994). Because Smith did not file a notice of claim within 180 days of the injury and did not show good cause for that failure, we affirm the judgments.</p>
    <p id="b1409-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1409.15",1409,[970,360,757,1189]]]'>On October 21, 1990, Smith, the City of Saco Fire Chief, and Voisine, a volunteer member of Goodwin Mills, were involved in an automobile accident as they were responding to a fire. After the accident, Smith filed a workers’ compensation claim with the City of Saco Fire Department. Northern General Services, Inc., the insurance company handling Smith’s claim for the City, contacted York Mutual Insurance Company, Voisine’s automobile insurer, to notify it of Northern General’s lien and to request information regarding Voisine’s automobile policy limits. In March 1991, York Mutual informed Northern General that it did not consider itself responsible for the matter and provided Northern General with the name of the insurance agency that placed the coverage for Goodwin Mills. Northern General’s letter to that agency described the accident and Smith’s injuries, indicated York Mutual’s opinion that coverage should be provided by the agency, and asserted Northern General’s lien. All of this correspondence occurred within 180 days of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b1409-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1409.16",1409,[970,1581,756,461]]]'>Some time in May 1991, more than 180 days after the accident, Smith’s attorney first wrote to CIGNA, the insurance company providing Goodwin Mills’s coverage, regarding his representation of Smith. He did not contact CIGNA again until September 1991. CIGNA responded in a November 1991 letter implying that either the CIGNA policy or the York Mutual policy would provide coverage for the accident.</p>

In their answers, both Voi-sine and Goodwin Mills raised as an affirmative defense Smith’s failure to give notice pursuant to 14 M.R.S.A § 8107. Goodwin Mills’s motion for a summary judgment on the ground that Smith failed to provide time<a id="p1352" href="#p1352" data-label="1352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1352</a>ly notice was granted by the court <em>{.Cole, J.). </em>Shortly thereafter, Voisine moved for a summary judgment on the same ground.

Smith first contends that Voisine is not entitled to notice under the Act because he was acting outside the scope of his employment. We find no merit to this argument. The Act explicitly includes volunteer firefighters in its definition of employee, <em>see <a href="/a2d/574/0888-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="574 A.2d 888" data-case-ids="7387184" data-case-paths="/a2d/574/0888-01">id.</a> </em>§ 8102(1), and Voisine was proceeding to a fire in response to a call from Goodwin Mills when the accident occurred. Thus, if Smith did not comply with the Act’s notice requirements, he may not proceed with his claim against either defendant. <em>See Miller v.

A plaintiff that has not made a timely filing, however, may be excepted from this requirement by showing good cause for this failure. As Smith concedes that he did not file a formal notice of claim within the meaning of section 8107 with either Goodwin Mills or Voisine within 180 days after the accident, our inquiry is limited to whether he had good cause for not doing so.</p>
