Sheetz and Mar-gareta Anne Miller, co-representatives of the estate of Margaret Parker Sheetz, filed suit in our Superior Court to set aside a tax sale of real property formerly owned by Mrs. Sheetz. They contended that the sale had not been conducted in strict compliance with the requirements of the tax sale statute and regulations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial judge granted motions of the District and of the purchasers at the tax sale for summary judgment, concluding that the regulation on which the appellants relied was inconsistent with the applicable statute.

The only challenge to the sales by the former owners, whose interests were terminated by the sales, concerns the sufficiency of published notice of the sales. The notices were published once in each of two newspapers of general circulation. The former owners argue that regulations then in effect required two publications of notice in each of the newspapers. In granting summary judgment, the trial judge held that “as a matter of law, ... the published notice [of sale] was legally sufficient.” [Mem. op. at 4.]</p>

The District advertised the 1987 sale (for 1986 taxes) and the 1988 tax sale (for 1987 taxes) by publishing notice of each sale once in two newspapers of general circulation. The District met all other legal requirements for both sales, including mailed notice to the owner regarding each of the sales, and regarding the impending termination of each redemption period.</p>
    <p id="b566-14" data-blocks='[["BL_566.12",566,[1004,1073,749,793]]]'>The former owners contend that the District was required to publish notice of each sale more than once in each of two newspapers of general circulation. They base their argument on 9 DCMR § 316.2 (July 1986), which arguably required more than a single publication of notices of sale. The version of § 316.2 published in the DCMR is substantially different from the version enacted by the Council of the District of Columbia in D.C. Law 5-8, 30 D.C.Reg. 1789 (May 20, 1983). The District’s position is that the language enacted by the Council prevails, and that the version of the regulation erroneously published in July 1986 was never legally in effect. We agree with the District.</p>

D.C.Code § 47-1001 (1973). The pre-Home Rule Council of the District of Columbia had also promulgated a regulation which re<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>quired in pertinent part, consistently with § 47-1001, that “a notice of sale of such [delinquent tax] property shall be advertised once <em>in two major daily newspapers published in the District of Columbia </em>at least three weeks prior to the day fixed for such sale.” D.C.

Following the demise of <em>The Star </em>newspaper, the Council enacted D.C.Law 4-81, Newspaper Publication Act of 1981, to provide that the tax sale must be published once in two general circulation newspapers, and defined a general circulation newspaper as one "published in the District, once every two weeks or more frequently." When Title 9 of the D.C. Municipal Regulations was published in July 1982, the regulation in regard to tax sales stated that the tax sale must be published once every two weeks in two general circulation newspapers. This regulation does not conform to D.C.Law 4-81 nor was it enacted by the Council as required by law.</blockquote>

Comparison of this language with D.C.Code § 47-1301 indicates that the 1982 and 1986 versions probably have a typographical error and that the emphasized language should have been placed after the word “District,” as it was in the statute and in the 1984 version of 9 DCMR § 316.2.</p>

Contrary to appellants' position, however, the judgment of the trial court may be affirmed on a ground not raised or considered below. <em>See e.g., In re O.L., </em><a href="/a2d/584/1230-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="584 A.2d 1230" data-case-ids="7393825" data-case-paths="/a2d/584/1230-01">584 A.2d 1230</a>, 1232 &amp; n. 6 (D.C.1990). In the present case, the District has not relied on appeal on any evidence not presented to the trial court. Rather, the District has brought to our attention legal material — statutes, regulations, and case law — which are available to counsel for all parties, and of which we can properly take judicial notice. Appellants have had an appropriate opportunity to respond to the District's arguments, and have suffered no procedural unfairness.</p>
