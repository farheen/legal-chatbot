Towlson (“Towlson”), or in the alternative, that she was not Monumental’s servant nor was she acting within the scope of her employment at the time the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b202-19" data-blocks='[["BL_202.19",202,[984,1501,749,618]]]'>This personal injury action arises out of an automobile accident involving the plaintiff Brenda Jo Barnes and Towlson. At the time the accident occurred Towlson was in the midst of a fourteen week training session as an agent for Monumental. Her duties were to include sales and collections. The employees of Monumental were expected to use their own cars while on the job. Towlson understood and consented to this condition. She was also receiving a salary during this training period which was adjusted to cover automobile expenses.</p>
    <p id="b202-20" data-blocks='[["BL_202.20",202,[984,2147,746,415]]]'>At the time of the accident, Towlson was en route to meet the vice-president and sales manager of Monumental who was supervising her training. From their meeting point in Milford, Delaware, they were to proceed to visit customers in the area. The accident, which is the subject of this suit, occurred before Towlson reached her destination.</p>

The guiding rule of law in this area is agreed upon by the parties. Simply stated, it is to the effect that a master is not liable for the tort’s of his agent committed while driving to and from his place of employment. The plaintiffs have urged, however, that this Court find an exception to this general rule to the effect that where there are no work premises established as such, an employee who uses his own car in furtherance of his job is within the scope of his employment while driving to a business appointment. <em>Rappaport v.
