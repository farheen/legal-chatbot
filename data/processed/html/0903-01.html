It is also alleged that Nippon, through its liaison, engaged in a series of ongoing contacts, meetings, and opportunities to exchange information with several Pennsylvania companies.

Applying <em>Kubik, swpra, </em>the proper inquiry is whether Nippon’s conduct was such that it should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in Pennsylvania. The specific inquiry is whether Nippon purposefully directed its activities at residents of Pennsylvania and purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within Pennsylvania, thus invoking the benefits and protection of its laws.</p>

Appellant avers that the L-tryptophan in the weight-loss products she ingested was provided (in part) by Food Science, Corporation, a New Jersey company. Food Science Corporation obtained the ingredient from an American company known as Chugai Boyeki America who obtained it from Chugai Boyeki Tokyo. It was this last company, Chugai Boyeki Tokyo, who actually purchased it from the manufacturer, Nippon.

Here, the alleged injuries were claimed to be caused by L-tryptophan, an ingredient in the weight-loss products consumed by appellant. We specifically note that appellee apparently never sold L-tryptophan to <em>any </em>United States (let alone Pennsylvania) company; that Nippon did not advertise the product in the U.S.; that no agent of the appellee ever visited the Commonwealth regarding L-tryp-tophan sales; and that, according to the appellant, the L-tryptophan allegedly manufactured by Nippon went through at least four different enterprises before ending up in the hands of appellant. Even when we examine <em>all </em>of appellee’s contacts with this state (even those completely unrelated to the product L-tryptophan) we note that Nippon has no office here; is not qualified to do business here; and owns no property nor does it maintain a bank account in this state. Under the circumstances presented we find that Nippon’s conduct was not such that it should reasonably anticipate being haled into court here.
