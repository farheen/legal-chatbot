        "text": "ORDER\nThis matter was before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order issued to the plaintiff to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. In this case plaintiffs have appealed from an order in the Superior Court granting defendant City of Providence\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In doing so the Superior Court ruled that plaintiffs notice to the city of injuries suffered because of a defect in the sidewalk was insufficient under G.L.1956 (1991 Reenactment) \u00a7 45-15-9 as a matter of law.\nAfter reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and after hearing their counsel in oral argument, the court is of the opinion that cause has not been shown.\nSection 45-15-9(a) provides that \u201ca person injured shall within sixty days give to the municipality notice of the time, place and cause of the injury * * In Maloney v. Cooke, 21 R.I. 471, 44 A. 692 (1899) plaintiff had notified the city that she had fallen \u201cwhile walking on the southerly side of Church Street.\u201d This court ruled that notice was insufficient or too vague and general to meet the statute\u2019s purpose of adequately informing the city council of the defect causing the injury.\nWe have ruled that the notice requirement is a condition precedent to the plaintiffs right of action. Hareld v. Napolitano, 615 A.2d 1015, 1016 (R.I.1992) (citing Barroso v. Pepin, 106 R.I. 502, 506, 261 A.2d 277, 279 (1970)). It may not be waived. Batchelder v. White, 28 R.I. 466, 68 A. 320 (1907).\nOur interpretation is a strict one because for many years this court has construed that to be the intent of the Legislature in enacting this statute. Any change, therefore, should come from the Legislature.\nIn view of the above, plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in support of an estoppel theory are unavailing.\nFor these reasons the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is denied and dismissed, the judgment appealed from is affirmed and the papers of the ease are remanded to the Superior Court.\nFAY, C.J., did not participate.",
