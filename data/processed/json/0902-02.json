The court also ordered that before respondent could obtain reinstatement, he must present expert medical evidence that the mental condition that was causally related to his misconduct had been alleviated. Before us, after a remand from this court at the request of the Board on Professional Responsibility following respondent\u2019s reinstatement in Maryland on December 8, 1993, is a Report and Recommendation of the Board to which neither respondent nor Bar Counsel has taken exception. Accordingly, following the recommendation of the Board, it is\nthat respondent David A. ORDERED Friedman is hereby suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for the period of one year, nunc pro tunc to December 4, 1992, and that he be required to show proof of fitness and proof that the mental condition that was causally related to his misconduct has been alleviated, prior to his readmission to the practice of law. D.C.Bar R. XI, \u00a7 16.\n. On the basis of the Maryland action, we entered an interim order on January 22, 1993, suspending respondent in this jurisdiction as well. D.C.Bar R. XI, \u00a7 11.",
