We find no merit in Francis\u2019 contention that the District Court (Bangor; Kravchuk, J.) erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test. On the evidence before it, the District Court committed no clear error in its factfinding that the officer requiring the blood test had probable cause to believe Francis had been operating under the influence. See State v. Baker, 502 A.2d 489, 491 (Me.1985).\nThe entry is:\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\nAll concurring.",
