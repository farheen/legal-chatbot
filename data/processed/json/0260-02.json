The statute in question, G.L.1956 (1989 Reenactment) \u00a7 27-34-12, has a plain and unambiguous meaning and this court is bound to construe the statute in accordance with that plain meaning. Krupa v. Murray, 557 A.2d 868, 869 (R.I.1989). Any amount payable under the Rhode Island Insurer\u2019s Insolvency Fund Act must be reduced by any recovery .under any other insurance policies. Plaintiffs have already received the maximum allowable under the statute. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, it is the conclusion of this court that cause has not been shown.\nThe ruling of the trial justice is affirmed and the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is denied and dismissed.",
