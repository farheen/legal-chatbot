        "text": "Wokley, Chief Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\nBudd & Votaw seek registration of \u201cFog Cutter\u201d for men\u2019s and boys\u2019 jackets, raincoats, shirts and sweaters, alleging use since 1961. David Crystal, Inc. opposes on prior registrations of \u201cFoggers\u201d and \u201cBritish Foggers\u201d for ladies\u2019 and misses\u2019 dresses, coats, dress and jacket ensembles, suits, blouses, slacks, coveralls and jumpers. In dismissing the opposition the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board stated:\nApplicant\u2019s mark \u201cFog Cutters\u201d and opposer\u2019s marks \u201cFoggers\u201d and \u201cBritish Foggers\u201d manifestly differ substantially in both appearance and sound, and they convey distinctly different commercial impressions. In view thereof, it is our opinion that there is no reasonable likelihood of purchaser confusion, mistake or deception.\nNo testimony was taken regarding channels of trade, quality or prices of the competing goods, the parties merely submitting on the record and briefs.\nWe agree with the board\u2019s assumption that the goods are of such nature as to be made by a single manufacturer and probably sold through the same trade channels. We also agree that application of the competing marks to the respective goods would not result in any likelihood of confusion.\nHere, as in all such cases, the competing marks have something in common, else there would be no contest. In this instance, opposer dissects his allegedly arbitrary mark \u201cFoggers\u201d into \u201cfog\u201d and \u201cer\u201d in an attempt to establish confusion. We do not think purchasers would be prone to follow that course when the marks are viewed as a whole, as they must be. The fact that applicant\u2019s mark is applied to mens\u2019\u2019 apparel, and opposer\u2019s mark to ladies\u2019 garments, goods presumably bought with some degree of care, provides additional reason in support of the board\u2019s holding.\nRich, J., dissents.\nSmith, J., dissents.",
