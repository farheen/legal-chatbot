Ira Carlton Hatch, Jr., No. SC07-1697, 968 So.2d 558 (Fl. September 27, 2007), this court\u2019s July 13, 2010, order suspending respondent pending further action of the court and directing him to show cause why identical reciprocal discipline should not be imposed, and the statement of Bar Counsel regarding reciprocal discipline, and it appearing that respondent has failed to file a response to this court\u2019s order to show cause or the affidavit required by D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14(g), it is\nORDERED that Ira C. Hatch, Jr., Esquire is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia.
