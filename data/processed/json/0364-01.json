        "text": "KELLY, Associate Judge:\nAppellant Michael A. Jones is a mental patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital where he has been committed since March 1976, pursuant to D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(d). In February 1977, he appealed from an order by Judge Eugene N. Hamilton denying his request for immediate release from St. Eliz-abeths or in the alternative for civil commitment in accordance with the procedures set forth in D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 21-545(b), basing his challenge to his continued confinement on the argument that detention beyond the maximum period for which he could have been imprisoned for the offense of which he was acquitted denies him equal protection of the laws.\nOur first panel opinion, which relied on an express abstention from a challenge to his initial commitment, held that appellant had no right to the relief requested. Jones v. United States, D.C.App., 396 A.2d 183 (1978). Appellant petitioned for rehearing or rehearing en banc, objecting to the panel\u2019s decision as unfairly based on his abstention from a challenge to the initial commitment under D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(d)(2). Rehearing was thereafter granted and a second opinion issued holding that appellant was entitled to immediate release unless the government civilly committed him pursuant to D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 21-545(b) because the \u201crelease hearing procedure is to some extent \u2018punitive\u2019 \u201d and it would be a denial of equal protection to confine appellant under criminal commitment procedures beyond his hypothetical maximum prison sentence. Jones v. United States, D.C.App., 411 A.2d 624 (1980). The government petitioned for rehearing en banc, disputing the determination that the District of Columbia commitment scheme for insane criminals is punitive. Its petition was granted and the case was reheard by the en banc court. Since our previous opinions were vacated, we consider anew appellant\u2019s equal protection claim and hold that he is not entitled to automatic release from St. Elizabeths upon the expiration of his hypothetical maximum prison sentence unless civil commitment proceedings are instituted by the government.\nAppellant\u2019s commitment resulted from a September 1975, charge of attempted petit larceny. He was first admitted to St. Eliza-beths because of a court-ordered competency examination. On March 12, 1976, on stipulated facts as to the crime and as to insanity, appellant was acquitted by the court of the charge by reason of insanity. On May 25, 1976, Judge James A. Washington held a \u201c50-day release hearing\u201d pursuant to D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(d)(2) and continued appellant\u2019s confinement at St. Elizabeths because of his failure to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he. was no longer mentally ill or dangerous to himself and others. A further hearing was set for November 29, 1976. On that date, Judge Hamilton held a second hearing during which appellant raised the argument that his confinement under \u00a7 301(d) could not extend beyond his hypothetical maximum prison sentence and that he was therefore entitled to release. The court ordered the government to show cause why appellant should not be released or civilly committed under D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 21-545(b). After a hearing in February of 1977, Judge Hamilton denied appellant\u2019s motion for immediate release or, in the alternative, civil commitment, and continued his indefinite confinement at St. Eliza-beths. A timely appeal from this order was filed on February 28, 1977.\nBefore analyzing appellant\u2019s equal protection claim, we deem it necessary to reject any suggestion that confinement pursuant to subsection 301(d) is punitive in nature. We recognize that appellant never explicitly made such an assertion, but that implication underlies his argument (and certainly our prior opinions) that the length of the prison sentence which an acquittee might have received determines when he is entitled to release or civil commitment under Title 24 of the D.C.Code. We conclude that there is no basis for finding \u00a7 301(d) punitive in any respect.\nThis court\u2019s decision in Bethea v. United States, D.C.App., 365 A.2d 64, 90 (1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 911, 97 S.Ct. 2979, 53 L.Ed.2d 1095 (1977), noted that \u201cCongress struck a careful balance between the interest of the individual and those of the community,\u201d in the enactment of the District of Columbia commitment scheme for persons acquitted by reason of insanity. The purpose behind this careful balance was explained in Hough v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 195, 271 F.2d 458, 461 (1959), when Judge Bazelon stated that\n[T]he basic policy underlying the statute ... as we read the legislative history, is to provide treatment and cure for the individual in a manner which affords reasonable assurance for the public safety. .. .\nMore recent cases reiterate the dual purpose of \u00a7 301(d) as first, the treatment and recovery of the patient, and second, the protection of society and the patient. Collins v. Cameron, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 306, 308, 377 F.2d 945, 947 (1967); Overholser v. O\u2019Beirne, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 269, 302 F.2d 852, 854 (1961); Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 312, 281 F.2d 943, 947 (1960). The 1970 amendments to \u00a7 301(d), enacted in response to the decision in Bolton v. Harris, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 395 F.2d 642 (1968), have not altered its original purpose. See United States v. Jackson, 179 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 381, 553 F.2d 109, 115 (1976). Indeed, the Bolton decision inescapably leads to the conclusion of nonpuni-tiveness. This is because Bolton\u2019s requirement of a separate judicial hearing before indeterminate commitment was intended to undo the punitive aspects attending the formerly automatic connection between the determination of guilt and the commitment of a defendant who pleaded insanity.\nThe exclusively remedial and protective goals of the statute demonstrate that a punitive rationale has no part in the commitment of persons acquitted by reason of insanity. We agree that\n[i]n the light of [the legislative] purpose [of \u00a7 301], we must reject the District Court\u2019s suggestion that appellant is a \u201cprisoner.\u201d Nothing in the history of the statute \u2014 and nothing in its language \u2014 indicates that an individual committed to a mental hospital after acquittal of a crime by reason of insanity is other than a patient. The individual is confined in the hospital for the purpose of treatment not punishment; and the length of confinement is governed solely by considerations of his condition and the public safety. Any preoccupation by the District Court with the need of punishment for crime is out of place in dealing with an individual who has been acquitted of the crime charged. [Hough v. United States, supra at 196, 271 F.2d at 462.]\nSociety may not excuse a defendant\u2019s criminal behavior because of his insanity and at the same time punish him for invoking an insanity defense. This would nullify that defense, contrary to express legislative intent, see D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(j) (establishing procedures for pleading insanity), and raise serious constitutional issues.\nThe regulatory nature of \u00a7 301(d) is also evidenced by the non-adversarial character of commitment decisions. All parties, including the government, the hospital and the acquittee assist in presenting the facts relevant to a determination of the proper conditions and treatment for the insanity acquittee. See United States v. Ecker, 177 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 45, 543 F.2d 178, 192 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1063, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 779 (1977); Bolton v. Harris, supra at 12 n.64, 395 F.2d at 563 n.64; Lake v. Cameron, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 268, 364 F.2d 657, 661 (1966) (en banc).\nFurthermore, plain reason compels rejection of appellant\u2019s reliance on his hypothetical maximum prison term as artificial and meaningless. Statutory maximum sentences have no relationship to the purposes of mental care and treatment. They are intended rather, to set the outer boundaries of lawful punishment for persons found criminally responsible for specified offenses. Not even convicted criminals are automatically sentenced to the maximum applicable term of incarceration. Subsection 301(d) commitments are neither expressly nor impliedly related to statutory maximum sentences. To the contrary, \u00a7 301(d) contemplates an indeterminate period of confinement and treatment, depending on when the patient has recovered his sanity or no longer poses a danger to himself or others. As Dixon v. Jacobs, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 325, 427 F.2d 589, 595 (1970) explains:\nConfinement of the mentally ill rests upon a basis substantially different from that which supports confinement of those convicted of crime. In the latter case, with rare exceptions, the continuing validity of confinement rests solely on the validity of the initial commitment. Confinement of the mentally ill, however, depends not only upon the validity of the initial commitment but also upon the continuing status of the patient. Specifically, under our statutes, he must be released from the hospital if he is no longer mentally ill; if, although he remains mentally ill, he is no longer \u201clikely to injure himself or other persons\u201d; or, should the patient so desire, if a course of outpatient treatment can be fashioned that will adequately protect the interests both of the patient and the public. [Footnotes omitted.]\nThe notion that the duration of an acquit-tee\u2019s hospitalization can be established by statute or court order ignores the most basic precepts of medicine and psychiatry. Unfortunately, the present state of the art makes it generally impossible to predict either the time required to rehabilitate a mental patient, if at all possible, or at what point he will cease to be a danger to himself or others. Only ongoing medical and psychiatric evaluation offer a realistic hope of such prognosis. Therefore, reference to either a hypothetical maximum prison sentence, or even to a judicially limited commitment term would completely refute the statutory purpose of \u00a7 301(d) and would frustrate any attempt at treating and rehabilitating mental patients who happen to have been acquitted of crimes by reason on insanity.\nOur conclusion that \u00a7 301(d) is not punitive is supported by our recent decision in United States v. Edwards, D.C.App., 430 A.2d 1321 (Nos. 80-294 & 80-401, May 8, 1981) (en banc), where the contention that incarceration inevitably constitutes punishment was rejected. Though commitment of acquittees is in no sense incarceration, the principle that the penal character of a statute depends on its underlying nature and whether it is reasonably supported by a legitimate state interest, applies equally to the analysis of commitment statutes. There is no evidence that the District of Columbia statutory scheme for commitment of insane criminals is anything but a regulatory, prophylactic statute, based on a legitimate governmental interest in protecting society and rehabilitating mental patients. Nor is \u00a7 301(d) rendered penal by the fact that it is predicated on the commission of a crime. Evidence of crime is only one of the elements triggering \u00a7 301(d) commitment, the other element being proof of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Since the crime is relevant only insofar as it indicates dangerousness, not evil or criminal responsibility, the presumption of continuing dangerousness, which is rebuttable by the acquittee, is both reasonable and valid.\nBecause we have no evidence in the record that the conditions of appellant\u2019s confinement are punitive or that his particular commitment was based on punitive considerations, we must conclude that appellant\u2019s detention is grounded on the legitimate nonpunitive interests of the District of Columbia.\nAppellant challenges his confinement under \u00a7 301(d) as violative of equal protection of the laws. The due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which is directly applicable to the District of Columbia, encompasses the right to equal protection. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); Matter of C.W.M., D.C.App., 407 A.2d 617, 625 (1979).\nIn the absence of specific objections to conditions of confinement or claims of inadequate or discriminatory treatment, the validity of appellant\u2019s equal protection claim depends on whether the differences between the present \u00a7 301(d) commitment scheme and the involuntary committment scheme under \u00a7 545(b) of Title 21 are justifiable by reason of the situational differences between acquittees and committees.\nOur analysis begins with the Supreme Court case of Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 86 S.Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966), which held that equal protection requires that a prisoner to be transferred to a mental hospital be given the same procedural protections as those afforded other persons subject to involuntary civil commitment. Two years later, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that Baxstrom\u2019s equal protection holding, as well as the due process guarantees of Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967), require that \u201cpersons found not guilty by reason of insanity ... be given a judicial hearing with procedures substantially similar to those in civil commitment proceedings.\u201d Bolton v. Harris, supra at 10, 395 F.2d at 651 (footnote omitted). Bolton was expressly premised on the weakness of the proof of a defendant\u2019s insanity at the time of the offense; when Bolton was decided, the standard for acquittal was whether there was a reasonable doubt regarding past sanity. Id. at 8, 395 F.2d at 649. The 1970 amendments to \u00a7 301 have significantly narrowed this evidentiary gap by requiring that the defendant affirmatively prove his exculpating insanity to the jury by a preponderance of the evidence at the trial for his criminal offense. D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(j). The judicial hearing required by Bolton was codified in \u00a7 301(d)\u2019s 50-day release hearing provision, notwithstanding the changed nature of the insanity defense.\nThe equal protection test suggested by these cases is that the procedures and standards of different commitment schemes be relevant to the classification and that any differences not be substantial. We therefore agree with the statement in United States v. Jackson, supra at 386, 553 F.2d at 120, that \u00a7 301(d) \u201cmust be upheld if there is a rational basis for the scheme it creates.\u201d The court arrived at this conclusion by determining that neither Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972) (indeterminate pretrial commitment procedures found to violate equal protection), nor Baxstrom, supra, held that strict scrutiny applies to procedures used for the criminal commitment of mentally ill persons. In reviewing the petitioner\u2019s argument in Baxstrom, Chief Justice Warren stated that \u201c[e]qual protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but it does require that a distinction made have some relevance to the purpose for which classification is made.\u201d Baxstrom, supra, 383 U.S. at 111, 86 S.Ct. at 762. Bolton also recognized that \u201ca reasonable application [of the equal protection doctrine] permits Subsection (d) to treat persons acquitted by reason of insanity differently from civilly committed persons to the extent that there are relevant differences between those two groups.\u201d Bolton, supra at 10, 395 F.2d at 651. But substantial differences are prohibited under Bolton. Id. Thus, a reasonable distinction between the two statutory schemes would be one that is both relevant to the government\u2019s legitimate interests in the separate classification and not impermissibly substantial.\nBefore reviewing the differences between \u00a7 24-301(d) and \u00a7 21 \u2014 545(b), it is important to note their similarities. First, the substantive standard of commitment is identical under both statutes. The twofold proof requirement of mental illness and dangerousness varies only in the manner in which it is established. Second, both \u00a7 24-301(d)(2) and \u00a7 21-545(b) provide for mandatory judicial hearings, with notice and assistance of counsel (court-appointed if necessary). These common characteristics constitute the essential due process rights associated with involuntary commitment. See Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980) (recognizing a prisoner\u2019s due process rights to a hearing before transfer to a mental health facility); Specht v. Patterson, supra. Thus with respect to important constitutional protections the two statutes provide the same coverage.\nAs persuasively explained in our first panel opinion, the differences between the two procedures\ncan be justified by reference to situational differences between the two groups immediately prior to the respective hearings. The civil commitment question, as to any potential committee, is of first impression, whereas the \u201crelease hearing\u201d procedure for an acquittee presumably can be somewhat abbreviated because of the predictive value of the initial determinations of insanity and dangerousness at the criminal trial. (That predictive value rests on the defendant\u2019s own prior proof of his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 by a jury trial if he requested it.) Whereas the \u00a7 24-545(b) hearing, therefore, represents a de novo process, the \u00a7 24-301(d) hearing is an updating process to determine how present mental status compares with earlier findings which had been urged by the defendant himself.... In either case, the only concern is a determination as to sanity and dangerousness, with a view to rehabilitation. Given these situational differences between acquittees and potential committees immediately prior to the initial commitment determination, the difference in hearing procedures is arguably justified; there is no constitutional prohibition against rational differences in the treatment of differently situated persons. [Jones v. United States, supra, 396 A.2d at 189.]\nThere appear to be three differences between \u00a7 24-301(d) and \u00a7 21-545(b) commitments: (1) the availability of jury trial, (2) the question of who carries the burden of proof, and (3) the amount of proof required to justify commitment. We review these distinctions individually to ascertain whether they are permissibly relevant or imper-missibly substantial under Baxstrom and Bolton.\nWhile the jury trial right available to committees is not similarly available to an acquittee in a 50-day release hearing, this difference is justified by the fact that the acquittee has had a right to a jury determination of his sanity at the time of the offense. Thus the acquittee\u2019s mental illness is initially established by affirmative proof.' Dangerousness is no less validly established by proof that the defendant committed the criminal act, a finding necessarily underlying any acquittal by reason of insanity. See Bethea, supra at 93-95; Smothers v. United States, D.C.App., 403 A.2d 306, 310 (1979). In United States v. Ecker, supra at 48, 543 F.2d at 195, the court stated that \u201c[s]ince 1958 this court has consistently accepted the proposition that the dangerousness demonstrated by the commission of a crime and acquittal by reason of insanity constitutes a rational basis for the disparity in release provisions governing acquittees and committees.\u201d (Footnote omitted). Ecker also recognized that some disparities in commitment proceedings are similarly permissible, id. at 49-50, 543 F.2d at 196-97, and explained that \u201c[s]ubsection (d) patients are treated differently from civil committees because they are \u2018an exceptional class of people\u2019 who have \u2018already unhappily manifested the reality of anti-social conduct.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 50, 543 F.2d at 197 (footnotes omitted).\nThe fact that appellant\u2019s mental illness and dangerousness are not jury determined, but derived from a prior jury finding, is not significant since the continuation of these attributes is a rational and permissible evi-dentiary presumption. In Waite v. Jacobs, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 288-89, 475 F.2d 392, 399-400 (1973), the validity of this presumption was recognized:\nThe rational justification for placing the burden of proof on a committee is that his mental illness and dangerousness have previously been convincingly established. In light of those established facts, the law gives effect to a presumption of continuity of status. It comports with normal perceptions of reality \u2014 and hence is rational \u2014 to assume that, once a given status is proven to exist, it continues to do so in the absence of evidence showing the contrary to be more likely than not.\nIn Waite, however, the presumption was not applicable because unlike in the instant case, the appellant had never been afforded a post-acquittal judicial hearing on the question of his continued mental illness and dangerousness.\nThe availability of a jury trial under \u00a7 21 \u2014 545(b) and the absence of such a right at a \u00a7 24-301(d) hearing is also an insubstantial difference because the findings of mental illness and dangerousness are based on expert testimony and are not matters uniquely within the province of a jury of lay persons. In Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 429, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1811, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), the Court explained that in contrast to delinquency proceedings or criminal prosecutions where \u201cthe basic issue is a straightforward factual question \u2014 did the accused commit the act alleged,\u201d the factual questions in a civil commitment proceeding \u201crepresent only the beginning of the inquiry.\u201d The Court continued: \u201cWhether the individual is mentally ill and dangerous to either himself or others and is in need of confined therapy turns on the meaning of the facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiatrists and psychologists.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). Thus, both judge and juror are forced to rely on expert evidence in commitment proceedings, significantly diminishing the importance of their personal judgment, values and experience. In sum, because (1) an acquittee has a right to a jury determination of past insanity at his criminal trial; (2) it is reasonable to presume the continuation of a mental illness; and (3) a jury right in commitment proceedings is not as meaningful as it is in ordinary criminal cases, the absence of a jury right at a \u00a7 24-301(d) release hearing is not a substantial difference vis-a-vis \u00a7 21-545(b) civil commitment.\nThe second distinction between the two commitment procedures in the District of Columbia is the fact that the government bears the burden of proof in a \u00a7 21-545(b) hearing, whereas in the 50-day release hearing, the acquittee must prove that he is no longer mentally ill or dangerous. It is entirely rational for the District to require an acquittee to prove his entitlement to release where he was the one to advocate the fact of his past insanity. Automatic \u00a7 301(d) commitment does not follow an acquittal by reason of insanity when the question of insanity is raised by the court or the prosecutor, rather than the defendant. United States v. Wright, 167 U.S.App.D.C. 309, 511 F.2d 1311 (1975). As mentioned above, the presumption that a mental condition continues is a reasonable one and it is also reasonable to require the person who raised the presumption to refute it by affirmative proof. Furthermore, whatever difference in risk allocation there might be between the two statutes as a result of who bears the burden of proof is minimized by the fact that when the acquittee bears the burden, he need prove entitlement to release by only a preponderance of the evidence, the lowest standard of proof, whereas when the government bears the burden, it must prove insanity and dangerousness by a higher standard, namely that of clear and convincing evidence. In re Nelson, D.C.App., 408 A.2d 1233 (1979).\nYet this disparity in the level of proof by which mental illness and dangerousness are established under the two procedures, when not regarded as a counterbalance to the risk of non-persuasion, is another difference between \u00a7 24-301(d) and \u00a7 21-545(b) which must be justified as rationally related to the situational differences between acquittees and committees. An acquittee\u2019s past insanity is proven by a preponderance of the evidence. His present insanity is determined by his failure to rebut, by a preponderance of the evidence, the presumption of continuing insanity. In contrast, a committee\u2019s detention is based on clear and convincing evidence of mental illness and dangerousness. In re Nelson, supra. The difference between these two standards is justified by the fact that Congress determined that a defendant raising an insanity defense should not have to meet a higher burden on such a relatively difficult issue. However, when the District seeks to commit a person who is disputing the fact of insanity or dangerousness, it is reasonable that the risk of error be more heavily thrust upon the government. See Addington v. Texas, supra.\nIn Bolton, supra at 10 n.50, 395 F.2d at 651 n.50, and in United States v. Brown, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 402, 478 F.2d 606 (1973), the circuit court also recognized that a preponderance standard is enough to provide equal protection to acquittees.\nAppellant has argued that a series of later Supreme Court and circuit court decisions based on an equal protection theory support his entitlement to release as of the expiration of his hypothetical maximum prison term. However, the cases cited by appellant are all distinguishable.\nIn Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972), a defendant convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor was committed to a \u201csex deviate facility\u201d in a Wisconsin state prison in lieu of sentence. The statute authorizing such commitment provided an initial term equal to the maximum sentence the defendant could have received, and five-year renewals based on a judge-made finding of dangerousness. The statutory scheme in Humphrey clearly included an express punitive element evidenced by the limitation of the initial commitment term to a period corresponding to that applicable to those convicted.\nIn the same term that it decided Humphrey, the Supreme Court held that indefinite confinement of a person charged with a crime and found incompetent to stand trial violated equal protection because the criminal charges were insufficient to prove either that the defendant was dangerous or that he required treatment. Jackson v. Indiana, supra. Jackson is inapposite to the instant case because Jackson was never tried for the crime with which he was charged. See United States v. Ecker, supra at 49-51, 543 F.2d at 196-98 (distinguishing Jackson for same reason in equal protection challenge to \u00a7 24-301(e)). Since his continued detention was not based on any other evidentiary predicate of dangerousness, it therefore became invalid after \u201cthe reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that [the person held] will attain [the] capacity [to stand trial] in the foreseeable future.\u201d Id. 406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858.\nAppellant\u2019s reliance on the District of Columbia Circuit cases of Waite v. Jacobs, supra, and United States v. Brown, supra, is also unavailing. Waite was acquitted before the Bolton decision and therefore automatically committed after a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity without a judicial hearing on his continued mental illness and dangerousness, which was subsequently required by Bolton and codified in \u00a7 24-301(d)(2). Waite\u2019s commitment was therefore invalid from the beginning and arguably justifiable only as penal detention. As such, it was limited to the applicable maximum sentence period.\nBrown was a \u201cpost-Bolton, pre-1970 amendments\u201d acquittee who challenged the burden of proof at his post-acquittal judicial hearing. The Court of Appeals in Brown upheld the preponderance standard applied, justifying the difference in the level of proof vis-a-vis the level of proof required in \u00a7 21-545(b) proceedings by the \u201cmeaningful elements of responsibility\u201d which an acquittee may have. Insofar as this reasoning suggests a punitive element to \u00a7 301(d) we reject it as inconsistent with our finding that the commitment scheme for acquittees is not intended to attribute any guilt or imply any social indebtedness in the excuse of a criminal offense. Therefore, we need not follow the dicta in Brown that \u201c[t]he extent of [the commitment] period [justified by a post-Bolton, pre-1970 amendments commitment] calls for sound discretion, would take into account, e. g., the nature of the crime (violent or not), nature of treatment given and response of the person, would generally not\"\nexceed five years, and should, of course, never exceed the maximum sentence for the offense, less mandatory release time.\u201d Id. at 408, 478 F.2d at 612. As previously explained, the only factors relevant to release from a mental institution are the ac-quittee\u2019s continued dangerousness and his need for treatment. Judicial limitations on the duration of confinement based on hypothetical prison terms or other arbitrary determinations of a maximum term of hospitalization, as suggested in Brown, have no relation to the purpose of the statute. In any event, the need for such limitations has been obviated by the enactment of the 1970 amendments to \u00a7 24-301.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s right to immediate release or, in the alternative, civil commitment pursuant to D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 21-545(b) is\nAffirmed.\n. Subsection 24-301(d), which controls the commitment of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity (acquittees), reads:\n(d)(1) If any person tried upon an indictment or information for an offense raises the defense of insanity and is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, he shall be committed to a hospital for the mentally ill until such time as he is eligible for release pursuant to this subsection or subsection (e).\n(2) A person confined pursuant to paragraph (1) shall have a hearing, unless waived, within 50 days of his confinement to determine whether he is entitled to release from custody. At the conclusion of the criminal action referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall provide such person with representation by counsel\u2014\n(A) in the case of a person who is eligible to have counsel appointed by the court, by continuing any appointment of counsel made to represent such person in the prior criminal action or by appointing new counsel; or\n(B) in the case of a person who is not eligible to have counsel appointed by the court, by assuring representation by retained counsel.\nIf the hearing is not waived, the court shall cause notice of the hearing to be served upon the person, his counsel, and the prosecuting attorney and hold the hearing. Within ten days from the date the hearing was begun, the court shall determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. The person confined shall have the burden of proof. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person confined is entitled to his release from custody, either conditional or unconditional, the court shall enter such order as may appear appropriate.\n(3) An appeal may be taken from an order entered under paragraph (2) to the court having jurisdiction to review final judgments of the court entering the order.\n. Subsection 21-545(b), concerning involuntary civil commitment, reads, in pertinent part:\nIf the court or jury finds that the person is mentally ill and, because of that illness, is likely to injure himself or other persons if allowed to remain at liberty, the court may order his hospitalization for an indeterminate period, or order any other alternative course of treatment which the court believes will be in the best interests of the person or of the public. The Commission, or a member thereof, shall be competent and compellable witnesses at a hearing or jury trial held pursuant to this chapter. The jury to be used in any case where a jury trial is demanded under this chapter shall be impaneled, upon order of the court, from the jurors in attendance upon other branches of the court, who shall perform the services in addition to and as part of their duties in the court.\n. See D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(a). The psychologist\u2019s report stated that appellant was competent to stand trial, but that he had \u201csigns and symptoms of a sever mental disorder, including auditory hallucinations\u201d and that he should be hospitalized at St. Elizabeths for treatment.\n. See note 1 supra.\n. In an April 23, 1976 letter, the Superintendent of St. Elizabeths reported that Jones was suffering from schizophrenia, paranoid type, and was on medication. The letter also stated that \u201cMr. Jones is in need of further hospitalization, and by virtue of his mental illness, he would be a danger to himself and to others if released into the community at this time.\u201d\n.A subsequent motion for unconditional release under \u00a7 301(k) was denied in March of 1977. Three months later, however, appellant was granted conditional release on terms recommended by St. Elizabeths\u2019 staff, allowing daytime and overnight visits into the community. He was also admitted into the civil division of the hospital, though as a result of disruptive behavior, he was retransferred to the forensic division.\n. Bolton held that acquittees are entitled to a hearing \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the hearings afforded civil committees before they are indeterminately confined. The implications of this holding are more fully discussed below.\n. In Dixon v. Jacobs, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 330, 427 F.2d 589, 600 (1970), the circuit court in reversing the dismissal of an insanity acquit-tee\u2019s habeas corpus petition, stated that \u201cSaint Elizabeths bears a special responsibility for assuring that information regarding the patient\u2019s condition is fully presented to the District Court, and that the court understandingly considers the information presented.\u201d\n. Thus it would be more accurate to say, and certainly more analytically useful, that appellant is actually challenging the indeterminate length of his commitment at St. Elizabeths, rather than only his \u201ccontinued\u201d confinement there. Equal protection, if violated at all, would be just as well put into question at the inception of the commitment since it effectively means an indefinite period of confinement.\n. See Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 430-31, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1811-12, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), and authorities cited therein, holding that the lack of certainty and the fallibility of psychiatric diagnosis make proof of insanity by clear and convincing evidence constitutionally sufficient. Addington also recognized that \u201c[i]n a civil commitment state power is not exercised in a punitive sense.\u201d Id. at 428, 99 S.Ct. at 1811. While Chief Justice Burger\u2019s opinion did not deal with commitment of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, a \u00a7 301(d) commitment is actually a civil, not a criminal proceeding and Addington\u2019s reasoning should apply with equal force to commitment of acquittees.\n. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537-38, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1873, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Factors relevant to the determination of whether a statute is punitive are:\n\u201cWhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014 retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.\u201d [Id. at 537-38, 99 S.Ct. at 1873 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554, 567-68, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963)).]\nThe Bell case also noted that\nA court must decide whether the disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate government purpose .... Absent a showing of an expressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility officials, that determination generally will turn on \u201cwhether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to it].\u201d [id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. at 567-68 and citing Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 613-17, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1373-76, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (I960)) (emphasis added).]\n.The right to treatment for mental illness is recognized in Tribby v. Cameron, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 327, 379 F.2d 104 (1967), and Rouse v. Cameron, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 366, 373 F.2d 451 (1966).\n. Specht held that sentencing pursuant to Colorado\u2019s Sex Offenders Act was criminal punishment and violated due process because it made a conviction for a sex offense the basis of indeterminate sentencing without affording the defendant a hearing on the issue of his mental illness, dangerousness or recidivism.\n. Subsection 301(j)\u2019s shift in the burden of proof was upheld against constitutional attack in Bethea, supra, and United States v. Greene, 160 U.S.App.D.C. 21, 489 F.2d 1145 (1973), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 977, 95 S.Ct. 239, 42 L.Ed.2d 190 (1974).\n. See also State v. Krol, 68 N.J. 236, 252, 344 A.2d 289, 298 (1975) (questioning the equal protection test applicable to differences in commitment schemes required by Baxstrom, supra, and Jackson v. Indiana, supra) and Novak, Realigning the Standards of Review Under the Equal Protection Guarantees \u2014 Prohibited, Neutral and Permissive Classi\u00f1cations, 62 Geo. L.Rev. 1071, 1101-03 (1974) (suggesting that Jackson v. Indiana, supra, and Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972), were based on a \u201cdemonstrable rational basis\u201d test).\n. The two-prong test is explicitly stated in \u00a7 21-545(b); however, \u00a7 24-301(d) refers only to an acquittee\u2019s entitlement to release. But it is reasonable to assume that the same standard governs \u00a7 301(d) release hearings by reference to \u00a7 24-301(e), which states that entitlement to release, upon hospital certification, depends on a showing that the acquittee is no longer mentally ill and dangerous.\n. Justice White approvingly listed the following procedures outlined by the Nebraska District Court as the minimum required before transfer of a prisoner to a mental hospital:\n\u201cA. Written notice to the prisoner that a transfer to a mental hospital is being considered;\nB. A hearing, sufficiently after the notice to permit the prisoner to prepare, at which disclosure to the prisoner is made of the evidence being relied upon for the transfer and at which an opportunity to be heard in person and to present documentary evidence is given;\nC. An opportunity at the hearing to present testimony of witnesses by the defense and to confront and cross-examine witnesses called by the state, except upon a finding, not arbitrarily made, of good cause for not permitting such presentation, confrontation, or cross-examination;\nD. An independent decisionmaker;\nE. A written statement by the factfinder as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for transferring the inmate;\nF. Availability of legal counsel, furnished by the state, if the inmate is financially unable to furnish his own; and\nG. Effective and timely notice of all the foregoing rights.\u201d [Vitek v. Jones, supra at 494-95, 100 S.Ct. at 1264.]\n.The Specht opinion held that\nDue process ... requires that [the defendant] be present with counsel, have an opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against him, have the right to cross-examine, and to offer evidence of his own. And there must be findings adequate to make meaningful any appeal that is allowed. [Id. 386 U.S. at 610, 87 S.Ct. at 1212.]\n. We do not compare the differences in post-commitment procedures since they are not covered in these subsections and appellant\u2019s claim is based on the alleged invalidity of his confinement under subsection 301(d).\n. Appellant\u2019s waiver of the right to a jury at his criminal trial does not affect our argument.\n. It is also noteworthy that the Criminal Jury Instruction for the District of Columbia, No. 5.11 (3d ed. 1978), to be given when a defense of insanity is pleaded, informs the jury that the consequence of an acquittal by reason of insanity will be automatic commitment of the defendant to St. Elizabeths, followed by a release hearing within 50 days. The jury is also instructed that at this hearing the defendant must prove to the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to release. This instruction was approved in United States v. Brawner, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 29-30, 471 F.2d 969, 997-98 (1972).\n. Since appellant has not challenged his initial commitment, we view his argument as based on a present denial of equal protection. We note, however, that in May 1976, when appellant received his 50-day release hearing, the prevailing standard was proof beyond a reasonable doubt, In re Hodges, D.C.App., 325 A.2d 605 (1974) (overruled in In re Nelson, supra ). The greater disparity in proof between the two commitment standards that existed when appellant was first committed would not alter our conclusion that the difference in the level of proof required is both rational and not so substantial as to violate equal protection.\n. We disagree with the interpretation of Humphrey in Waite v. Jacobs, supra at 287, 475 F.2d at 398, that there is little difference between the position of an acquittee and that of a convicted defendant subject to the Wisconsin statute, since we have determined that there is no punitive element to \u00a7 301(d) commitments.\n. These cases are not formally binding on this court because they were decided after February 1, 1971, the effective date of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970.

        "text": "FERREN, Associate Judge,\nwith whom NEWMAN, Chief Judge, and MACK, Associate Judge, join, dissenting:\nI continue to subscribe to our division opinion on rehearing, 411 A.2d 624 (1980), vacating 396 A.2d 183 (1978).\nI.\nUnder the civil commitment process, D.C. Code 1973, \u00a7\u00a7 21-541 to -545, the government has the burden of proving a person is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others \u2014 and proving it to a jury if the potential committee so demands. Id. \u00a7 21-544. In contrast, under the \u201cinsane criminal\u201d commitment process, D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7\u00a7 24-301 to -303, a defendant acquitted by reason of insanity has the burden of proving he or she no longer is mentally ill or dangerous \u2014 without the right to a jury. Id. \u00a7 24-301(d)(2).\nOur colleagues in the majority conclude that these differences in treatment of two classes of institutionalized persons \u2014 committees and acquittees \u2014 do not violate the acquittee\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. In response to the allegation that the procedural shortcuts in \u00a7 24-301 reflect a punitive purpose, in contrast with a wholly therapeutic purpose underlying the civil commitment process, the majority concludes \u201cthat there is no basis for finding \u00a7 301(d) punitive in any respect.\u201d Ante at 368.\nI do not understand the majority to disagree with the proposition that if \u00a7 24-301(d) imposes punishment in any respect, the analysis in our division opinion is constitutionally sound. It would follow that, \u201cbecause the maximum possible prison term for which appellant Michael Jones could have been incarcerated has expired, he is entitled to release from St. Elizabeths Hospital, subject to the government\u2019s right to seek civil commitment.\u201d 411 A.2d at 630.\nI therefore propose to discuss in greater detail the determinative issue: whether \u00a7 24-301(d) is, to some extent, punitive.\nII.\nThe Supreme Court has identified several factors for use in determining whether a statute is punitive. A court first should look for \u201cobjective manifestations of congressional purpose.\u201d Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 169, 83 S.Ct. 554, 568, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963). Accord, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1873, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Where it is not clear on the face of the statute whether Congress had a punitive intent, a court must consider a variety of other factors:\nWhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions. [Kennedy, supra 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. at 567-68 (footnotes omitted).]\nAccord, Bell, supra, 441 U.S. at 537-38, 99 S.Ct. at 1873. In the present case, we confront a statute for which Congress clearly had a punitive purpose.\nA. The Previous Statute and Judicial Construction\nAnalysis begins with the previous statute. See, Kennedy, supra at 170, 83 S.Ct. at 568. Under D.C.Code 1967, \u00a7 24-301(d), a defendant who successfully interposed the insanity defense was committed automatically \u2014 and indefinitely \u2014 to a mental institution. However, in Bolton v. Harris, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 395 F.2d 642 (1968), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that automatic commitment of acquittees was unconstitutional \u2014 a denial of equal protection visa-vis committees. The court accordingly required that, upon a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, an acquittee was constitutionally entitled to the equivalent of a civil commitment proceeding, which came to be known as the \u201cBolton hearing.\u201d Five years later, in United States v. Brown, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 402, 408, 478 F.2d 606, 612 (1973), the court held that even after a \u201cBolton\u201d hearing the disparities of treatment were such that \u201cinsane criminal\u201d commitment under D.C.Code 1967, \u00a7 24-301, having a partially punitive purpose, must be limited to the hypothetical maximum sentence (less mandatory release time), after which the acquittee would be entitled either to release or to a civil commitment proceeding. Accord, Waite v. Jacobs, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 284-85, 475 F.2d 392, 395-96 (1973).\nApropos of Brown, the en banc majority concedes in the present case that the prior statute had \u201cpunitive aspects,\u201d a quality that Bolton was necessary to \u201cundo.\u201d Ante at 369. And yet in the same paragraph the majority states that \u201c[t]he 1970 amendments to \u00a7 301(d), enacted in response to\u201d Bolton, \u201chave not altered its original purpose,\u201d ante at 369, which the majority \u2014 in a nonsequitur \u2014 characterizes as nonpunitive by reference to Hough v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 271 F.2d 458 (1959) and other pre-Bolton circuit court decisions. The majority, therefore, is inherently inconsistent. If, as the majority concedes, the pre-Bolton statute was punitive, to the point that Bolton was necessary to correct its unconstitutional impact, I do not see how statutory amendments \u201cin response to Bolton,\u201d providing lesser protections, can be said automatically to remove the original, \u201cpunitive aspects\u201d of that statute. The question remains: do the 1970 amendments modifying Bolton erase the punitive purpose of the previous statute?\nB. The Present Statute and Its Construction\n1. Legislative history confirms that, in amending \u00a7 24-301(d) in 1970, Congress held on to its original intent to punish the criminal offender, if not by conviction and imprisonment then by indefinite confinement in a mental institution. The overriding concern of the House of Representatives was that Bolton \u201cpermits dangerous criminals ... \u2018to have it both ways\u2019 \u2014 to escape both conviction and commitment to a hospital.\u201d House Comm, on The District of Columbia, District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970, Section 207 \u2014 Insane Criminals, at 74, H.R.Rep.No. 91-907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (emphasis added) (quoting Overholser v. O\u2019Beirne, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 276, 302 F.2d 852, 861 (1961)). The House considered the possibility that a criminal offender could get off without being either convicted or hospitalized \u201cintolerable.\u201d Id. See United States v. Jackson, 179 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 381-82, 553 F.2d 109, 115-16 (1976).\nThe congressional intention in drafting the present \u00a7 24-301(d), therefore, was \u201cto meet the objections of the Bolton court while preserving the principle of the mandatory commitment of those who escape criminal responsibility on the ground of mental abnormality.\u201d Bethea v. United States, D.C.App., 365 A.2d 64, 92 n.62 (1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 911, 97 S.Ct. 2979, 53 L.Ed.2d 1095 (1977) (emphasis added). Congress wanted to confront the criminal defendant with a choice: conviction or \u201cthe very real possibility of prolonged therapeutic confinement.\u201d Id. at 90 (footnote omitted). Because \u201cthe prospect of commitment to a mental institution for an indefinite period is much less desirable than a fixed term in prison,\u201d United States v. Freeman, 357 F.2d 606, 626 n.60 (2d Cir. 1966), Congress intended the substantial likelihood of indefinite confinement to provide an effective deterrent to those tempted to misuse the insanity defense to avoid criminal incarceration. In short, the legislative history of the 1970 amendments provides strong evidence that Congress, in overruling Bolton, intended to restore as much punishment under \u00a7 24-301(d), as constitutionally would pass muster.\n2. More than the legislative history, the legislative result \u2014 the statute itself \u2014 reveals that Congress maintained its punishment objective.\nFirst, the authorized procedures by which an acquittee may challenge confinement in a mental institution, D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7\u00a7 24\u2014 301(d)(2), -(k)(l) through (6), do nothing more than institutionalize the habeas corpus procedure that already was available at the time of Bolton. See Miller v. Cameron, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 323, 324, 335 F.2d 986, 987 (1964); O\u2019Beirne, supra at, 275, 302 F.2d at 860; Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 313-14, 281 F.2d 943, 948-49 (1960); D.C.Code 1967, \u00a7 24-301(g). Procedurally, therefore, the acquittee is no better off under \u00a7 24 \u2014 301 today than he or she was under the same statute before 1970. Unless the acquittee can prove he or she is not mentally ill or dangerous, confinement under \u00a7 24-301 is both automatic and indefinite.\nSecond, upon confinement, acquittees are not necessarily treated the same as committees. In this jurisdiction, an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity if \u201cas a result of a mental disease or defect he lacked substantial capacity either to recognize the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d Bethea, supra at 79 (emphasis added). Ordinarily, this jurisdiction treats individuals suffering from a mental \u201cdefect\u201d (i. e., mental retardation) differently from the way it treats individuals suffering from a mental illness. Under civil commitment procedures, a mentally defective individual who is \u201cnot insane nor of unsound mind to such an extent to require his commitment to a hospital for the mentally ill\u201d is committed to Forest Haven, a facility for retarded persons. D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7\u00a7 21-1101, 32-601. In contrast, an acquittee, even if only suffering from a mental defect, is committed to a hospital for the mentally ill, Saint Elizabeths. Id., \u00a7 24-301(d).\nIn United States v. Jackson, supra, the court upheld this distinction in treatment precisely because it recognized that Congress \u201cintended that all defendants acquitted by reason of insanity should be distinguished from all other persons, including persons civilly committed for mental diseases or retardation.\u201d Id. at 381, 553 F.2d at 115 (emphasis in original). In Jackson, the court justified this difference in treatment on the basis that acquittees, but for their insanity plea, had been found guilty of crimes against society. Id. at 387, 553 F.2d at 121. Apropos of Jackson, this difference in treatment of certain acquittees cannot possibly be justified merely on the basis of an evidentiary presumption concerning the continuing mental condition of the acquit-tee. See note 1 supra. Rather, it is an express statutory provision, justified by reference to the criminality of the acquittee\u2019s prior conduct.\nThird, and perhaps most telling, is another example of differing possibilities for release of acquittees and committees after confinement. When the superintendent of Saint Elizabeths Hospital certifies that a committee is cured, the individual is discharged from the hospital. D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 21-590. In contrast, when the hospital superintendent certifies that an acquittee has recovered, the government may demand a hearing. At this hearing, if the court is not convinced that the acquittee has recovered, the court may order his or her return to the hospital even though the authorities there consider the individual well enough for release. D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301(e).\nIn United States v. Ecker, 177 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 543 F.2d 178 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1063, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 779 (1977), an acquittee challenged the constitutional validity of this added hurdle \u2014 court approval \u2014 before release. Five years after a jury had found the defendant not guilty of rape and murder by reason of insanity, the superintendent of Saint Elizabeths recommended conditional release. After a hearing, despite the recommendation of the examining psychiatrists, the trial court denied the hospital\u2019s request and ordered continued hospital confinement. In upholding the statute and the trial court\u2019s decision, the federal circuit court expressly relied on the fact that Ecker had committed a violent criminal act. Id. at 52, 543 F.2d at 199. Whether or not the hospital psychiatrists thought Ecker should be released, the trial court had a duty to protect \u201cthe public against whom the acquittee has already been shown to have committed one or more criminal acts, thus differentiating himself from the civil committee.\u201d Id. at 51, 543 F.2d at 198. \u201cMore importantly,\u201d the court rejected Ecker\u2019s equal protection argument based on Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972), Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 86 S.Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966), and Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972), reasoning \u201cthat the criminal conviction may justify some differences in procedural safeguards if the differences are \u2018limited by the nature of the defendant\u2019s crime or the maximum sentence authorized for that crime\u2019 \u201d Id. at 51-52, 543 F.2d at 198-99 (quoting Humphrey, supra at 511, 92 S.Ct. at 1053) (emphasis added). Because Ecker could have been incarcerated, however, for a life sentence if not acquitted by reason of insanity, the differences in release procedures (between acquittees and committees) were therefore justifiable. Finally, the court rejected the hospital recommendation by saying that even if the hospital were correct \u201cthat a step-by-step reentry into the community [was] essential to Ecker\u2019s continued improvement,\u201d an acquittee \u201cwho has committed violent criminal acts\u201d has \u201cno right to treatment at the community\u2019s peril.\u201d Id. at 52-53, 543 F.2d 199-200.\nGiven the legislative history, the differences in treatment of acquittees and committees, and the judicial gloss on the statute by decisions such as Ecker, the majority\u2019s position that the purpose of the statute is solely to \u201ctreat[ ] and rehabilitate] mental patients who happen to have been acquitted of crimes by reason of insanity,\u201d ante at 370, is unsupportable. Acquittees are not just mental patients \u201cwho happen\u201d to have been acquitted of crimes by reason of insanity. The fact of their criminal conduct continues to play a decisive role in the nature of their treatment and their chances for release after initial commitment. Congress and the courts have justified this harsher treatment precisely because acquit-tees have committed crimes.\nC. The Relevance of the Statutory Maximum Sentence\nThe majority rejects the use of statutory maximum sentences to determine the maximum length of confinement under \u00a7 24 \u2014 301 because such m\u00e1ximums have \u201cno relationship to the purposes of mental care and treatment.\u201d Ante at 369. I agree. The majority states that \u201c[t]he notion that the duration of an acquittee\u2019s hospitalization can be established by statute or court order ignores the most basic precepts of medicine and psychiatry . . . .\u201d Ante at 370. Again, I agree. If the acquittee were hospitalized solely for medical reasons, I would be the first to concur that a statutory maximum for confinement based on the nature of the acquittee\u2019s criminal conduct would have no relevance or application. But the problem is \u2014 and is so clearly evident in Ecker \u2014 that acquittees are not confined to mental institutions for medical reasons alone. They are confined there in part because society is unwilling to allow those who have committed crimes to escape without paying for their crimes. The intent of the statute is partially punitive, and thus the procedures under \u00a7 24-301 reflect this added burden on the defendant. Because of this punitive purpose, the maximum statutory period of confinement becomes relevant, for at that point society no longer has a valid interest in continued confinement on the basis of a shortcut procedure. Brown, supra at 408, 478 F.2d at 612; see Waite, supra at 285, 475 F.2d at 396; note 2 supra.\nIII.\nSociety\u2019s right to punish Michael Jones for his first offense, a misdemeanor \u2014 stealing a coat \u2014 has long since expired. As every day passes he is denied equal protection of the laws. Michael Jones should be released unless civilly committed.\n. The majority maintains that the lesser protections in \u00a7 24-301 \u2014 burden of proof on the ac-quittee, without right to jury trial \u2014 do not alter its equivalence to \u00a7\u00a7 21-544 and -545, for the acquittee already has had a right to jury trial on the conduct manifesting insanity, and the shift in burden of proof is justified by a valid evidentiary presumption that the acquittee\u2019s insanity at the time of the offense \u2014 which he himself asserted \u2014 continues to the time of the release hearing. That hearing, therefore, unlike a civil commitment proceeding, is a procedure to update, not initiate, the inquiry.\nIn our division opinion on rehearing we rejected that analysis. We noted that the presumption of continuing insanity is questionable, spanning as it does months or even years between the time of the offense and the time of the release hearing. Furthermore, we saw that the courts analyzing criminal and civil commitment schemes in other jurisdictions \u201ctypically mix evidentiary and punitive rationales in justifying less comprehensive review of acquittees at \u2018release hearings\u2019 than is afforded civil committees at such proceedings.\u201d 411 A.2d at 628-29 (footnote omitted). Differences such as a shift in the burden of proof and withdrawal of the right to a jury are commonly justified, in part, \u201cby the public\u2019s interest in greater protection than it would be likely to receive by subjecting acquittees to the civil commitment process.\u201d Id. at 630. We concluded, therefore, that \u201cthe difference[s] between criminal and civil commitment procedures cannot be justified on purely evidentiary grounds.\u201d Id.\n. In our division opinion on rehearing, we summarized our analysis:\nAssuming the best case for the constitutionality of \u00a7 24-301(d), appellant argues that its partially punitive character at least dictates, as a matter of equal protection vis-a-vis civil committees, that acquittees be released (or civilly committed) no later than the end of the maximum prison term they would have received if criminally convicted. We agree.\nAccording to Baxstrom [v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 111, 86 S.Ct. 760, 762, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966)], \u201c[e]qual protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but it does require that a distinction made have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made\u201d (citation omitted). Accord, Bolton [v. Harris, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 10, 395 F.2d 642, 651 (1968)]. On the basis of the partially punitive rationale for the criminal commitment scheme set forth earlier, see text and cases at note 9 supra, the criminal commitment scheme might survive equal protection scrutiny under Baxstrom, supra, even though the procedure for confining civil committees provides greater protection for the individual at the outset (the right to a jury and burden of proof on the government). We agree with appellant, however, that there is no basis confining an acquittee under \u00a7 24-301(d) beyond the length of the hypothetical maximum prison term, since that term marks the end of society\u2019s claim on that individual for any kind of punishment. Any longer confinement must depend, constitutionally, on a de novo civil commitment. See Humphrey [v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 510-11, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052-53, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972)]; Baxstrom [, supra, 383 U.S. at 110-11, 86 S.Ct. at 762]; [United States v. Brown, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 402, 408, 478 F.2d 606, 612 (1973)].\n411 A.2d at 630 (footnote omitted).\n. In reaching this result, the court relied on Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 86 S.Ct. 760, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966), and Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967). The circuit court expressly modified its earlier decisions in Overholser v. O\u2019Beirne, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 302 F.2d 852 (1961); Rags-dale v. Overholser, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 281 F.2d 943 (1960); and Overholser v. Leach, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 257 F.2d 667 (1958), cert. denied 359 U.S. 1013, 79 S.Ct. 1152, 3 L.Ed.2d 1038 (1959). Bolton, supra at 12, 395 F.2d at 653.\n. My colleagues\u2019 implication that altering the burden of proof and denying acquittees a right to jury trial are minor procedural distinctions from civil commitment, see ante at 372-375, is inconsistent with Congress\u2019 purpose in amending the statute to overrule Bolton. As this court recognized in Bethea, supra, imposing the burden of proof on the acquittee is a significant procedural distinction from civil commitment; it is designed to make it more difficult for the acquittee to gain freedom. Id at 91-92. Indeed, where proof is often difficult to assess, see Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 429, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1811, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), \u201cthe allocation of the burden of proof may be outcome determinative.\u201d Waite supra at 284, 475 F.2d at 395.\nThe majority\u2019s discounting of the role of the jury when questions of mental capacity are at issue is also in direct conflict with our ruling in Bethea, supra, which emphasized that, despite the impact of psychiatric testimony, it is for the jury, not the psychiatric expert, to decide the accused\u2019s mental state. Id at 82-83. The majority\u2019s emphasis on the factfinder\u2019s reliance on expert testimony in accessing the accused\u2019s mental state (and thus on the lesser need for a jury) was recently rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United States v. Ecker, 177 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 543 F.2d 178 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1063, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 779 (1977). There, the court upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to release an acquittee from a mental hospital despite the recommendations of his doctors, stating, \u201cthe district court must independently \u2018weigh the evidence\u2019 and make a de novo determination that the patient will not in the reasonable future endanger himself or others.\u201d Id. at 40, 543 F.2d at 187 (emphasis in the original).\n. The circuit court, more than once, has relied on the nature of the underlying offense to justify the consequences of confinement under \u00a7 24-301(d). In United States v. Jackson, supra, the court emphasized that the defendant had been acquitted by reason of insanity of first degree burglary and rape, in contrast with mere theft of small sums which would \u201cnot indicate excessive dangerousness.\u201d Id. at 387, 553 F.2d at 121.\n. Although the foregoing discussion is sufficient to demonstrate the congressional purpose underlying D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 24-301, I note briefly that the other Kennedy factors confirm the punitive intent.\nBy definition, confinement to a mental institution is \u201can affirmative disability or restraint,\u201d id. 372 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. at 567, even more perhaps than imprisonment, see Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 493-94, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1263-64, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980), given the indefinite duration and the stigma. See Addington, supra, 441 U.S. at 425-26, 99 S.Ct. at 1809. Despite its use for treatment, moreover, confinement for mental illness and dangerousness as a consequence of a criminal act \u201chas historically been regarded as a punishment,\u201d Kennedy, supra 372 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. at 567, for which the Supreme Court continually has had to write constitutional guidelines. See, e. g., Jackson v. Indiana, supra; Humphrey, supra; Specht, supra; Baxstrom, supra.\nCriminal confinement also comes into play \u201conly on a finding of scienter,\u201d Kennedy, supra at 168, 83 S.Ct. at 567; see Bethea, supra at 94 and \u201cthe behavior to which it applies is already a crime,\u201d Kennedy, supra at 168, 83 S.Ct. at 567, by virtue of the criminal conviction that precedes it. The statute also \u201cpromote[s] the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence,\u201d id., for, as already indicated, Congress and this court have noted a desire to prevent the misuse of the insanity defense by making the consequences more severe than de novo civil commitment. In addition, criminal confinement at w. mental institution serves other goals of punishment, incapacitation and rehabilitation. See United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 458, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1720, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965) (\u201cPunishment serves several purpose: retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent \u2014 and preventive\u201d). See generally, J. Vorenberg, Criminal Law & Procedure 44-57 (1975).\nFinally, for reasons already discussed, I do not believe there is a wholly nonpunitive, \u201calternative purpose,\u201d Kennedy, supra, 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. at 567-68, assignable to \u00a7 24-301; but even if the purposes assigned by the majority \u2014 treatment of the acquittee and protection of society \u2014 were altogether nonpun-itive, the indefinite confinement of Michael Jones for stealing a coat is well beyond any public protection gloss on the statute\u2019s purpose. It is one thing to keep an acquittee of murder and rape confined for life, see Ecker, supra, as he would be under appellant\u2019s theory here, for those are life-sentence crimes. But society has no \u201cprotection\u201d interest in confining Michael Jones indefinitely for stealing a coat, a misdemeanor punishable by maximum confinement for one year.\n. When a court confronts different procedural safeguards afforded to different classes of individuals committed to mental institutions, concerns of equal protection and due process become interrelated. See Jackson v. Indiana, supra 406 U.S. at 731, 92 S.Ct. at 1854; cf. Humphrey, supra, 405 U.S. at 511, 92 S.Ct. at 1053 (1972) (noting with favor the state court\u2019s consideration of Equal Protection Clause as relevant to procedural due process analysis); Specht, supra 386 U.S. at 608, 87 S.Ct. at 1211 (commitment proceedings for sex offenders subject both to Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses). In evaluating equal protection for the acquittee, I have not reached the question of due process as an independent concern, although there is a serious question here. I note, moreover, that any effort to reduce the procedural safeguards afforded to civil committees, while possibly resolving equal protection problems, would raise serious questions of due process for that class of individuals.",
