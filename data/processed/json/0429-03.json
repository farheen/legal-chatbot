For purposes of briefing and argument, petitioner in No. 600 EAL 2010, Wyeth, shall be listed as appellant, and petitioner in No. 610 EAL 2010, Patsy Lance, shall be listed as cross-appellant.\nThe issues in No. 600 EAL 2010, as stated by petitioner/appellant Wyeth are:\n(1) Whether the Superior Court erred in creating a new claim for \u201cnegligent design defect\u201d of a prescription drug, despite Plaintiff-Respondent Patsy Lance\u2019s repeated waiver of that claim?\n(2) Whether the Superior Court\u2019s creation of a new cause of action for \u201cnegligent design defect\u201d conflicts with this Court\u2019s settled precedent limiting product liability claims against manufacturers and sellers of prescription drugs?\n(3) Whether the Superior Court\u2019s creation of a new cause of action for \u201cnegligent design defect\u201d should properly be argued before this Court because it may affect' hundreds or thousands of cases and ignores that: (a) plaintiffs in design defect cases must plead and prove a \u201cfeasible alternative design;\u201d and (b) there should be deference to regulatory authorities?\nThe issues in No. 610 EAL 2010, as stated by petitioner/cross-appellant Lance are:\n(1) Did the Superior Court err in holding, in an acknowledged conflict with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\u2019s prediction of Pennsylvania law, that Pennsylvania law would not recognize a claim against a prescription drug manufacturer for negligent failure to test to discover a prescription drug\u2019s actual harmful side-effects?\n(2) Did the Superior Court err in holding that Pennsylvania law would not recognize claims against a manufacturer of a prescription drug, which the federal Food and Drug Administration ultimately ordered withdrawn from the market as too dangerous for any potential users, for negligently marketing that drug and for negligently failing to withdraw that drug from the market?",
