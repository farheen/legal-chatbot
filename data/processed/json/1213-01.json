        "text": "Hatbibld, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\nThis is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents affirming the decision of the examiner of interferences sustaining the opposition of appellee and holding that appellant was not entitled to registration of her trade-mark \u201c Peroxogen \u201d for use on hydrogen peroxide, bleaching compounds, and bleaching powders.\nIn its notice of opposition, appellee alleged that it was the owner of the trade-mark \u201c Dioxogen \u201d for use on \u201c antiseptic and disinfectant compounds\u201d; that the goods for which appellant\u2019s trademark 'was sought to be registered possessed the same descriptive properties as those on which the trade-mark of appellee has been and is now being used; that its mark \u201c Dioxogen \u201d was registered in the United States Patent Office for use on antiseptic and disinfectant compounds on August 25, 1903, No. 40998; and again on January-15, 1924, No. 118,628; that appellee\u2019s trade-mark has been in actual and continuous use since a date long prior to any use by appellant of her alleged trade-mark; and that appellee would be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark.\nIn her answer to the allegations contained in the notice of opposition, appellant alleged that her mark \u2014 \u201c Peroxogen \u201d was \u201c formed from the name of the product to which it is applied as shown in the following capitalization: \u2018 PEROX-ide-Of-hydroGEN \u2019 \u201d; that \u201c the word c oxygen \u2019 is common to both marks, is descriptive of an element of the goods of both opposer and respondent and, standing alone, is not capable of exclusive appropriation by either party? (Italics ours.)\nIn his decision, the Commissioner of Patents, among other things, said:\nThe essential grounds urged by the applicant in support of her appeal are that the examiner erred in holding that there is at least doubt that confusion in trade would be likely; that the examiner erred in not permitting the applicant to urge the lack of ownership of any trade-mark on the part of the opposer in view of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, in Oakland Chemical Co. v. Bookman, decided December 5, 1927; and that the examiner erred in refusing to permit applicant to urge that the descriptiveness of opposer\u2019s mark.\nIt is believed that the prior adjudications of the courts involving the rights .of the parties to this proceeding are conclusive of the question involved in the instant case, viz, whether the applicant is entitled to the registration for \u2022which she has made application.\nIn the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, in the case entitled Oakland Chemical Co., plaintiff, against Rose Nerenstone, doing business as the Peroxogen Co. of America, Judge Knox handed down a decision May 14, 1927, holding that \u201c the name adopted by the defendant is an infringement of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark admisf [admits] of little doubt,\u201d but that \u201c Dioxogen is descriptive of peroxide of hydrogen, and therefore, not capable of exclusive appropriation and registration.\u201d\nOn appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, the decision of the District Judge was affirmed (December 5, 1927), Judge Hand, in delivering the decision of the court, holding in effect that \u201c Dioxogen would infringe as much as peroxygen \u201d and that these and like terms describe the class of substances to which the product belongs.\nIt follows from these adjudications that registration of the applicant\u2019s mark is prohibited by section 5 of the trade-mark act of February 20, 1905, which provides:\nThat no mark which consists * * * merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, * * * shall be registered under the terms of this act.\nAs to the applicant\u2019s contention that the examiner erred in not permitting the applicant to urge lack of ownership of the mark on the part of opposer, it may be stated that a trade-mark use of a mark is not necessary in a proceeding of this kind. If the opposer can show in any way that it wpuld probably be damaged by the registration of the applicant\u2019s mark, it has the right to bring opposition proceedings. There is nothing in the trade-mark statute which says that a person must own a trade-mark, registered or not, before he can oppose the registration of the mark to another person. The Touraine Co. v. F. B. Washburn & Co., 309 O. G. 676; 52 App. D. C. 356; 1923 C. D. 174. (Italics ours.)\nCounsel for appellant concurs in the view expressed by the commissioner that appellee\u2019s mark \u201c Dioxogen \u201d is descriptive and that it was so held by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, in the case of Oakland Chemical Co. v. Rose Nerenstone Bookman, Doing Business as The Peroxogen Co. of America, 18 T. M. Rep. 1, 22 F. (2d) 930. However, counsel takes exception to the statement in the commissioner\u2019s decision that appellant\u2019s mark \u201c Peroxogen \u201d was also held to be descriptive. It is further contended that, as its mark has been held to be descriptive, appellee is not entitled to the exclusive use and is not the owner of the mark \u201c Dioxogen \u201d; that appel-lee can not invoke the confusion in trade clause of section 5 of the trade-mark act of February, 1905, as the basis of its opposition; and that, as appellee can not show \u201c statutory injury \u201d by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark, appellant is entitled to have her mark registered.\nIt is evident that the marks of the contending parties are used on goods of the same descriptive properties.\nIn the case of the Oakland Chemical Co. v. Rose Nerenstone Bookman, etc., supra, the Circuit Court of Appeals, in its statement of the case, said:\nTbe parties are both citizens of New York and the jurisdiction of the district court depended wholly upon the registration of the plaintiff\u2019s trademark, \u201c Dioxogen,\u201d whose infringement by the defendant\u2019s mark, \u201c Peroxogen,\u201d was the gist of the suit. Peroxide of hydrogen is a chemical product, so-called because it consists of a molecule of two atoms of oxygen and two of hydrogen. Its use as a disinfectant is old, and the plaintiff began to make and sell it in 1890, under the name \u201c Peroxide of Hydrogen, O. 0.,\u201d though its more proper chemical name is \u201c Dioxid of Hydrogen \u201d or \u201c Hydrogen Dioxid.\u201d The plaintiff, after using the second of these names for a while, in 1901 changed to \u201c Dioxogen,\u201d which it registered as a trade-mark in 1903 and again in 1924. It has spent large sums in advertising the product under that name and has registered the same mark in more than thirty foreign countries.\nThe defendant sells the same product under the name \u201c Peroxogen,\u201d but without attempting otherwise to invade the plaintiff\u2019s, good will. Since the suit depends upon registration, no. questions of secondary user or of other unfair competition at common law arise.\nThe court held that the mark \u201c Dioxogen \u201d was descriptive and, accordingly, affirmed the judgment of the District Court dismissing the bill of complaint. In its opinion, among other things, the Circuit Court of Appeals said:\nWhile that is indeed not itself an English word at all, its composition is apparent. \u201c Di \u201d is not an unknown prefix, e. g., \u201c diphthong,\u201d \u201c dilemma,\u201d \u201c dichotomy,\u201d and \u201c diptych \u201d ; and in scientific and technical terminology it is common. Its significance as a prefix to oxygen would be plain to a literate person; the word would mean \u201c double oxygen.\u201d True, it would still remain ambiguous, but then, too, so would \u201c Diox'd,\u201d standing alone, a word of common speech.\n* * # # * \u2756\nIt fails also in the second, \u201c Dioxid \u201d would infringe as much as \u201c peroxy-gen \u201d \u2014 more, indeed- \u2014 and yet it is the only proper word to describe the class of compounds which the plaintiff\u2019s product is. Certainly the defendant could have used it. Indeed, \u201c double oxygen \u201d itself would be an equal infringement. Both these are actual words. In a suit for unfair trade perhaps the plaintiff could forbid such words as \u201c peroxygen \u201d or \u201c bioxygen, \u201d for these are coined and it is no hardship to prevent their use.\nWhether the commissioner rightly construed the court\u2019s decision as holding that the word \u201c peroxygen \u201d was descriptive, need not give us great concern.\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary defines the words \u201c Peroxide,\u201d \u201c Dioxid,\u201d and \u201c Protoxid \u201d as follows:\nPeroxide, n. 1. Chem. \u2014 An oxid having a larger proportion of oxygen than any other oxid of the same series: Contrasted with protoxid, 2. Same as Wytbrogen dioxid,. Beginning \u201c Same \u201d italics ours.\nDioxide, n. Chem,. \u2014 An oxid containing two atoms of oxygen to the molecule.\nProtoxid, n. Chem. \u2014 An oxid containing only one atom of oxygen.\nThe question of the descriptiveness of appellant\u2019s mark, in view of the quoted definitions, requires no discussion. Obviously, if the word \u201c Dioxogen \u201d is descriptive, the word \u201c Peroxogen \u201d is none the less so. If neither is descriptive, then, in our opinion, the use by appellant of the mark \u201c Peroxogen \u201d on goods possessing the same descriptive properties as those on which appellee uses its registered mark \u201c Dioxogen \u201d would be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public and to deceive purchasers.\nThe right to oppose the registration of a trade-mark is not limited to those who possess exclusive ownership of a similar mark; nor are the Patent Office tribunals limited, in an opposition proceeding, to a consideration of the precise questions presented in a notice of opposition. On the contrary, in such a proceeding, they may dispose of any question relating to the proposed registration that might properly be considered in an ex parte case. California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 18 C. C. P. A. 1198, \u2014 F. (2d) \u2014, decided concurrently herewith, and cases therein cited.\nFor the reasons stated, the decision is affirmed.",
