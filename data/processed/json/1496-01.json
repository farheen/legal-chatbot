        "text": "OPINION\nPer Curiam:\nThomas Barrett contracted chicken pox. Mr. Barrett was not feeling well and went to respondent St. Rose de Lima Hospital (Hospital). There he was seen by respondent Dr. George Baird who, after performing several tests and prescribing treatments for Mr. Barrett, released Mr. Barrett from the hospital. That night, Mr. Barrett became delirious. He was rushed to the hospital and placed on a respirator, but the hospital did not have sufficient facilities to continue treating Mr. Barrett. Mr. Barrett was then transferred to the University Medical Center (Center).\nAt the Center, respondent Dr. Byron Brown treated Mr. Barrett. One of the treatments prescribed was a dialysis. Respondent Dr. Marvin Bernstein supervised the dialysis. During dialysis, Mr. Barrett had a cardiorespiratory arrest. As a result, he suffered severe brain damage and eventually died.\nAppellant Peggy Barrett (Barrett), Mr. Barrett\u2019s wife, commenced an action for medical malpractice. Barrett claimed that Mr. Barrett\u2019s death was the result of the combined effects of (1) the negligent failure of Dr. Baird, as an agent of the Hospital, to admit Mr. Barrett to the Hospital on January 26, 1989, when, she claims, there was clear medical evidence that his chicken pox had disseminated and that he was developing varicella pneumonia and secondary infections due to the virus, and (2) Drs. Brown and Bernstein\u2019s negligent failure to diagnose and correct a massive bleed into Mr. Barrett\u2019s left pleural space, and Dr. Bernstein\u2019s negligent dialyzing of Mr. Barrett when he was hemodynamically unstable, due to the bleed.\nBarrett commenced her action in accord with NRS 41A.016 by filing a petition before the Medical-Legal Malpractice Screening Panel (the screening panel) against Dr. Baird and the Hospital. Subsequent to a finding of no probability of negligence by the panel, Barrett filed a second petition with the panel against Drs. Brown and Bernstein. This panel, like the first, returned a finding of no probability of negligence as to the named physicians.\nDespite the respective panel findings of no probability of negligence, Barrett brought a wrongful death action against Dr. Baird, the Hospital, Dr. Brown, and Dr. Bernstein, alleging medical malpractice in the treatment of her husband. The panel findings were introduced into evidence. A unanimous jury found that the defendants were not negligent. Judgments were entered in favor of all defendants for costs and attorney fees pursuant to NRS 41A.056(2).\nBarrett filed two separate motions for a new trial \u2014 one based on asserted errors that occurred at trial and the other challenging the constitutionality of the screening panel statute. Both motions were denied. Barrett renews her denied challenges on appeal. Specifically, Barrett claims the screening panel statute is unconstitutional because it violates the right to a jury trial, equal protection, separation of powers, and due process. Furthermore, she claims that the district court abused its discretion in not granting her a new trial because opposing counsel engaged in discovery misconduct, made a remark about the high cost of health care, made an improper \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument, showed the jury a picture of one of counsel\u2019s family, conducted a scientific demonstration during opening statement without laying foundation and then stated in closing argument that Barrett failed to refute the experiment, and, finally, improperly referred to the screening panel as an expert witness. Barrett also claims that the district court should have excluded evidence that she remarried.\nWe conclude that the screening panel statute is constitutional. Nevertheless, we reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment and award of attorney fees in favor of respondents on the grounds that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant Barrett a new trial due to respondents\u2019 counsels\u2019 misconduct. NRCP 59(a)(2).\nRespondents first claim that Barrett is precluded from raising her constitutional challenges on appeal to this court because they were not raised at trial. Failure to object below bars review on appeal. Old Aztec Mine, Inc. v. Brown, 97 Nev. 49, 52-53, 623 P.2d 981, 983-84 (1981). However, this court may address constitutional issues raised for the first time on appeal. See McCullough v. State, 99 Nev. 72, 74, 657 P.2d 1157, 1158 (1983). We do so here.\n7. Right to a Jury Trial\nNRS 41 A.049(2) and NRS 41A.016(2) provide that the screening panel\u2019s decision is admissible at trial and that the panel may base that decision on medical records and expert witnesses, some of which may contain hearsay that would be inadmissible at a trial. However, the statutes do not provide a claimant before a screening panel the opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses. Furthermore, panel members may not be deposed or subpoenaed regarding their decisions, nor may the panel\u2019s decision be subject to collateral review by a district court. See Phelps v. District Court, 106 Nev. 917, 921, 803 P.2d 1101, 1103 (1990).\nBarrett asserts that the screening panel statute violates her constitutional right to a jury trial by allowing the screening panel to \u201cpreadjudicat[e] the issues of negligence and causation based on incompetent evidence (affidavits) and in the absence of cross-examination.\u201d She argues that the jury is pot aware that the panel\u2019s decision is based on evidence which would not otherwise be admissible and which a plaintiff was not able to attack. She claims that the logical tendency is for a jury to overvalue the weight of the panel finding when the judge instructs the jury on the decision of \u201ca panel of experts.\u201d Thus, she concludes that introduction of the panel\u2019s decision at trial substantially burdens her and other claimants\u2019 constitutional right to a jury trial.\nWe hold that the panel\u2019s consideration of otherwise inadmissible evidence not subject to cross-examination, the inability to depose or subpoena members of the panel, and the lack of judicial review of panel decisions do not violate Barrett\u2019s or any malpractice claimant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial. Article 1, Section 3 of the Nevada Constitution states in pertinent part: \u201cThe right of trial by jury shall be secured to all and remain inviolate forever; . . ,\u201d In sum, the Nevada Constitution guarantees \u201cthe right to have factual issues determined by a jury.\u201d Drummond v. Mid-West Growers, 91 Nev. 698, 711, 542 P.2d 198, 207 (1975). This court has held that the correct standard for evaluating whether a statute unconstitutionally restricts the right to a jury trial is that the right \u2018\u201cmust not be burdened by the imposition of onerous conditions, restrictions or regulations which would make the right practically unavailable.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Williams, 110 Nev. 830, 833, 877 P.2d 1081, 1083 (1994) (quoting Application of Smith, 112 A.2d 625, 629 (Pa. 1955)). We hold that the screening panel statute does not make a medical malpractice claimant\u2019s right to a jury trial practically unavailable because it does not undermine the guarantee that a jury will find the facts.\nBarrett first claims that the screening panel statute denies her right to a jury trial because jurors will overvalue the weight of the panel\u2019s decision without knowing that the panel\u2019s decision relies on evidence that would be inadmissible at trial. This claim lacks merit. In Jain v. McFarland, 109 Nev. 465, 472, 851 P.2d 450, 455 (1993), this court held that the screening panel process \u201cis not a full trial on the merits and should not be represented as such.\u201d Indeed, NRS 41A.069, which sets out jury instructions that a jury are to be given when panel findings are introduced at trial, clearly indicates that the panel\u2019s recommendation is, in effect, \u201can expert opinion which is to be evaluated by the jury in the same manner as it would evaluate any other expert opinion.\u201d Comiskey v. Arlen, 390 N.Y.S.2d 122, 126 (App. Div. 1976), aff\u2019d 372 N.E.2d 34 (N.Y. 1977). In Nevada, as in most jurisdictions, experts may rely on evidence that is otherwise inadmissible at a trial even when testifying before a jury as to an ultimate issue such as negligence. NRS 41A.100, 50.285, 50.295. A jury is free to accept or reject that expert\u2019s opinion. Therefore, the fact that the screening panel\u2019s decision is introduced to the jury does not infringe on the jury\u2019s fact-finding duty even though the panel decision is based on otherwise inadmissible evidence.\nIn a recent federal court decision, Wray v. Gregory, 61 F.3d 1414 (9th Cir. 1995), referring to Nevada\u2019s screening panel statute, the Ninth Circuit, in dictum, questioned whether relying solely on the statutorily-mandated instruction that the jury \u201cweigh the screening panel\u2019s findings as it would \u2018any other evidence\u2019\u201d satisfied the Nevada and federal constitutions. Id. at 1419. The Ninth Circuit suggested, \u201ca judge would be well advised to supplement that instruction\u201d by pointing out that the screening panel procedure is only \u201ca summary process\u201d and that the panel\u2019s findings should not be given \u201cundue weight.\u201d Id. the court concluded that the jury should be instructed \u201cin a manner that will ensure that the evidence of the outside panel\u2019s conclusions does not \u2018interpose [an] obstacle to a full contestation of all the issues, and take[] [a] question of fact from . . . the jury.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 236 U.S. 412, 430 (1915)). We concur in the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit. In any event, we note that the suggestion in the Wray dictum concerning supplemental instructions was implemented in this case and, therefore, the instructions given in the instant case were constitutionally sufficient.\nBarrett also claims that a claimant\u2019s right to a jury trial is burdened by the fact that a claimant may not cross-examine the evidence reviewed by the screening panel at the meeting of the panel, depose or subpoena panel members, or seek judicial review of the panel decision. We hold that this does not burden Barrett\u2019s or any claimant\u2019s right to a jury trial. As already noted, the panel\u2019s decision is merely an expert opinion. Pursuant to NRS 41A.056(2), a plaintiff is free to bring a complaint and present her case to a jury despite the panel\u2019s decision. The panel\u2019s decision may be offered as evidence at trial along with other expert witness testimony, and should the plaintiff so choose, the same expert witnesses and exhibits can be presented to the jury as were presented to the screening panel. NRS 41A.016; 41A.069; see Jain, 109 Nev. at 473, 851 P.2d at 455. As stated by the court in Lacy v. Green, 428 A.2d 1171, 1176 (Del. 1981) (quoting Suchit v. Baxt, 423 A.2d 670, 675 (N. J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1980)), interpreting a statute similar to Nevada\u2019s screening panel statute:\n[The panel] cuts off no defense, interposes no obstacle to full contestation of all the issues, and takes no question of fact from either court or jury. . . . \u201cAlthough the panel decision is evidential, and this evidence would not exist but for [the screening panel,] plaintiff[s are] free to attack and impeach the panel determination by competent evidence.\u201d\nIndeed, in the instant case, at trial, Barrett\u2019s counsel cross-examined expert witnesses who submitted affidavits to the screening panel. Therefore, we conclude that the screening panel statute does not impede a claimant from attacking the basis for the conclusions of the panel before a jury and, thus, does not violate the right to a jury trial.\nIn Eastin v. Broomfield, 570 P.2d 744 (Ariz. 1977), the Arizona Supreme Court held that the admission of a medical malpractice screening panel\u2019s decision at trial did not violate the plaintiffs right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Arizona Constitution. The Arizona statute also provided that the panel\u2019s decision could be admitted into evidence at trial for consideration by the jury along with other evidence. Finding no constitutional infirmity, the court emphasized that \u201c[t]he jury remains the final arbiter of the issues raised and the facts presented.\u201d Id. at 748. Other jurisdictions have upheld medical malpractice screening statutes similar to Nevada\u2019s and have espoused the same rationale.\nSince the parties are in no way precluded from impeaching the panel\u2019s conclusion by competent evidence, or from showing that relevant evidence was not presented to the panel or from demonstrating the limited nature of the panel proceeding, we conclude that there is no valid concern that jurors will \u201covervalue\u201d the panel findings. For purposes of the constitutional right to jury trial, the jury is and remains the final arbiter. Therefore, w\u00e9 hold that the Nevada screening panel statute does not eviscerate a claimant\u2019s right to a jury trial.\nBarrett further argues that NRS 41A.016(2) violates the jury trial right because she claims it imposes on selected litigants, as a prerequisite to a jury trial, a process that strips a court of its constitutionally-protected authority to admit or reject evidence. Indeed, the provision of NRS 41A.016(2) which states that \u201c[t]he written findings of the screening panel are admissible\u201d is mandatory and a trial court has no discretion to refuse to introduce the panel\u2019s finding. Truck Insurance Exchange v. Tetzlaff, 683 F. Supp. 223, 226 (D. Nev. 1988) (citing Jain, 109 Nev. at 470 n.4, 851 P.2d at 454 n.4).\nHowever, we hold that the mandate that a panel\u2019s finding be introduced does not deprive medical malpractice claimants of their right to a jury trial. Several courts have adopted the position that statutory provisions governing the admissibility of nonbinding screening panel findings are essentially evidentiary rules allowing an expert opinion as a hearsay exception. See, e.g., Hines v. Elkhart General Hospital, 465 F. Supp. 421, 428 (N.D. Ind.), aff\u2019d 603 F.2d 646 (7th Cir. 1979). A legislature clearly has the power to enact rules of evidence. Comiskey, 390 N.Y.S.2d at 126. Nevada law is in accord. NRS 47.020-55.030; see White v. State, 83 Nev. 292, 296, 429. P.2d 55, 57 (1967) (legislature has power to establish rational evidentiary inferences and presumptions); Galloway v. Truesdell, 83 Nev. 13, 20, 422 P.2d 237, 242 (1967). Moreover, \u201cthe admissibility of the panel\u2019s findings is constitutionally unobjectionable because litigants have no vested rights in particular rules of evidence.\u201d State ex rel. Strykowski v. Wilkie, 261 N.W.2d 434, 451 (Wis. 1978) (citation omitted). Thus, we conclude that the screening panel statute is not constitutionally infirm simply because it mandates the introduction of the panel\u2019s finding at trial.\nBarrett also impliedly argues that the requirement of NRS 41A.056(2) that attorney fees be mandatorily imposed against claimants whose claims are rejected before the screening panel and who lose at trial restricts the right to a jury trial. Barrett\u2019s amici more explicitly make this argument. The amici argue that the attorney fees provision renders the right to a jury trial \u201cpractically unavailable,\u201d citing Williams, 110 Nev. at 833, 877 P.2d at 1083, by \u201cchilling\u201d access to the courts because of the enormous financial consequences if one fails at trial. Indeed, the judgment for attorney fees against Barrett in this case was $876,604.72.\nWe conclude that Barrett and amici\u2019s argument that NRS 41A.056(2) is constitutionally defective lacks merit. First, the American rule that each party pays its own attorney fees \u201chas no constitutional basis\u201d and \u201cmay be abrogated by contract, statute or Court rule providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Gordon v. Marrone, 590 N.Y.S.2d 649, 653 (Sup. Ct. 1992), aff\u2019d 616 N.Y.S.2d 98 (App. Div. 1994), appeal denied, 647 N.E.2d 453 (N.Y. 1995). In fact, the Nevada legislature has not hesitated to modify the American rule by enacting statutes allowing or requiring an award of attorney fees to prevailing parties under certain conditions. See, e.g., NRS 17.115, 18.010(2)(a), 69.030. Second, the right of malpractice plaintiffs to sue for damages caused by medical professionals does not involve a fundamental constitutional right. Everett v. Goldman, 359 So. 2d 1256, 1268 (La. 1978). In such cases, \u201caccess [to the court] may be hindered if there exists a rational basis for doing so.\u201d Linder v. Smith, 629 P.2d 1187, 1190 (Mont. 1981). In other words, constitutional \u201cright of access\u201d challenges that do not implicate a fundamental right are subjected to the lowest level of judicial scrutiny \u2014 the \u201crational basis\u201d test. Everett, 359 So. 2d at 1269. Applying this standard, the Florida Supreme Court flatly rejected the argument amici make here. Florida Patient\u2019s Compensation Fund v. Rowe, 472 So. 2d 1145, 1146 (Fla. 1985).\nAcknowledging the principle of deference to the legislature in the context of the screening panel statute as a whole, this court has observed: \u201cWe hesitate to disturb or question carefully crafted legislation which balances various concerns to arrive at a structure that will fairly benefit all the parties to a medical malpractice suit, limit the burdens on the judicial system, and reduce health care costs by discouraging frivolous litigation.\u201d Jain, 109 Nev. at 472, 851 P.2d at 455. In Jain, this court stated: \u201cThe purposes of the screening panel are to minimize frivolous suits against doctors, to encourage settlement, and to lower the cost of malpractice premiums and health care.\u201d Id. at 471, 851 P.2d at 455.\nWe hold that NRS 41A.056(2) is rationally related to those legitimate purposes. First, the provision attempts to minimize meritless suits against doctors by encouraging plaintiffs to carefully consider the likelihood of prevailing in court after at least four members of the screening panel \u2014 composed of three doctors and three members of the Nevada Trial Lawyers Association\u2014 have found \u201cno reasonable probability\u201d of malpractice. Second, the provision attempts to encourage settlement in two ways when a claimant is successful before the screening panel: (1) by encouraging defendants to settle by offering an amount equal to the value of the claim as determined by the judge, rather than risk being assessed attorney fees and costs if the plaintiff recovers a larger amount at trial, and (2) by motivating successful claimants to accept such offers, rather than risk being assessed attorney fees and costs if a lesser amount is recovered at trial. NRS 41A.059(4), (5). Third, by attempting to minimize meritless suits and encourage settlement, the provision attempts to \u201clower the costs of malpractice premiums and health care.\u201d Jain, 109 Nev. at 471, 851 P.2d at 455. Thus, the attorney fees provision of the screening panel statute neither denies Barrett nor other claimants a right to a jury trial, nor irrationally impedes claimants\u2019 access to the courts.\n2. Equal Protection\nBarrett contends that NRS 41A.009 and NRS 41A.016 deny medical malpractice victims equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 4, Section 21 of the Nevada Constitution. NRS 41A.016 provides: \u201cNo cause of action involving medical malpractice may be filed until the medical malpractice case has been submitted to an appropriate screening panel. . . .\u201d NRS 41A.009 states: \u2018\u201cMedical malpractice\u2019 means the failure of a physician, hospital or employee of a hospital, in rendering services, to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nBarrett does not claim that her right to bring an action for the wrongful death of her husband is a \u201cfundamental right,\u201d nor does she claim that a \u201csuspect classification\u201d is involved. However, Barrett asserts that there is no rational reason that the victims of medical negligence by physicians and hospitals be subjected to the burdens of the panel when injured patients of other health care providers are not.\nWe reject Barrett\u2019s contention. The screening panel statute\u2019s requirement that the screening panel process apply to malpractice suits against individual physicians and hospitals, but not to malpractice suits against other health care providers, has a rational basis and, therefore, is not a violation of equal protection. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids an enactment that \u201cdenies any person . . . equal protection of the laws.\u201d Article 4, Section 21 of the Nevada Constitution requires that all laws be \u201cgeneral and of uniform operation throughout the state.\u201d The standard for testing the validity of legislation under the equal protection clause of the state constitution is the same as the federal standard. Laakonen v. District Court, 91 Nev. 506, 538 P.2d 574 (1975).\nAs Barrett acknowledges, where, as here, no \u201cfundamental right\u201d or \u201csuspect classification\u201d is implicated, this court \u201cscru-tiniz[es] the challenged legislation for foundational support containing an ingredient of rational basis.\u201d Allen v. State Pub. Emp. Ret. Bd., 100 Nev. 130, 136, 676 P.2d 792, 795-96 (1984). This court will not overturn legislation unless the treatment of different groups \u201c \u2018is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature\u2019s actions were irrational.\u201d\u2019 Id. (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979)). \u201cIf any state of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify [the legislation], a statutory discrimination will not be set aside.\u201d State v. District Court, 101 Nev. 658, 662, 708 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1985) (citation omitted).\nWe conclude that the fact that the screening panel statute does not apply to all health care providers, but only to physicians, hospitals and hospital employees, is a rational legislative choice. Evidence before the legislature demonstrated that physicians and hospitals were experiencing enormous hikes in malpractice insurance premiums; there was no such evidence concerning the insurance rates of other health care providers. \u201cWhere there was evidence before the legislature reasonably supporting the classification, litigants may not procure invalidation of the legislation merely by tendering evidence in court that the legislature was mistaken.\u201d Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456 (1981).\nNevada\u2019s lawmakers could have concluded that physicians and hospitals were more affected by the perceived malpractice crisis than other health care providers, i.e., that they had more difficulty obtaining insurance, that their premiums were higher, that they bore more of the brunt of frivolous litigation, etc. \u201cIt is well-settled under rational basis scrutiny that the reviewing court may hypothesize the legislative purpose behind legislative action.\u201d Boulder City v. Cinnamon Hills Assocs., 110 Nev. 238, 249, 871 P.2d 320, 327 (1994) (citations omitted). It is equally well-settled, as stated by the California Supreme Court, that \u201cthe equal protection clause does not prohibit a legislature from implementing a reform measure \u2018one step at a time\u2019. . . or prevent it \u2018from striking the evil where it is felt most.\u2019 \u201d American Bank and Trust Co. v. Community Hosp. of Los Gatos-Saratoga, 683 P.2d 670, 677 (Cal. 1984) (holding statute intended to alleviate malpractice crisis did not violate equal protection). In any event, this court already stated in Jain regarding the screening panel statute that it hesitates to question or disturb carefully crafted legislation which fairly balances the interests involved in a medical malpractice suit and limits the judicial system\u2019s burdens and health care costs by discouraging frivolous litigation. 109 Nev. at 472, 851 P.2d at 455. Therefore, we hold that the distinction created by NRS 41 A.009 and NRS 41A.016 is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and does not violate equal protection.\n3. Separation of Powers\nIn support of her claim that the screening panel statute violates the separation of powers doctrine, Barrett essentially recycles her contentions about the constitutionality of NRS 41A.016(2), 41A.049(2), and 41A.056(2) outlined in the foregoing analysis of the jury trial issue. She claims that the statute violates separation of powers by (1) creating a court (i.e., the screening panel), not authorized by the constitution, whose decisions are immune from collateral attack or review by the litigant or the constitutionally authorized courts, and (2) stripping the district courts of their authority to conduct trials by not allowing them to determine the competency and admissibility of evidence, instruct the jury, and award attorney fees in their discretion. We conclude that these arguments lack merit for the same reasons we outlined in the analysis of the jury trial issue.\n\u201c \u2018Judicial power\u2019 is the authority to hear and determine justi-ciable controversies\u201d and any power that is \u201cinherent or incidental\u201d to that authority. Galloway, 83 Nev. at 20, 422 P.2d at 242. The screening panel does not exercise judicial power and, therefore, the screening panel statute does not violate the separation of powers. In Nevada, the screening panel\u2019s findings are not binding on anyone; they may merely serve as evidence at trial, and may be completely rejected by the jury.\nAs to Barrett\u2019s contention that the separation of powers is violated because the court is forced to admit the panel findings into evidence, to instruct the jury on those findings, and to award attorney fees if warranted, we hold that it is within the constitutional province of the legislature to create evidentiary rules and to mandate attorney fees. Therefore, the screening panel statute does not violate separation of powers.\n4. Due Process\nIn support of her claim that the screening panel statute violates due process, Barrett again recycles her contentions concerning the constitutionality of NRS 41A.016(2) and 41 A.049(2) outlined in our analysis of the jury trial issue. Because Barrett claims that her wrongftd death cause of action constitutes a property interest, she claims she is entitled to due process of law before she can be deprived of that interest. Barrett asserts that she and other claimants are denied due process because\nthe legislature has created the framework to deprive the victims of medical negligence of a constitutionally protected property right \u2014their cause of action \u2014 through a statute which relies on hearsay affidavits, the denial of the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, a misleading jury instruction and the elimination of the right of judicial review and appeal.\nArticle 1, Section '8 of the Nevada Constitution states, in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. ...\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution contains a similar provision. Fundamental to due process of law is the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner and at a meaningful time. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 267 (1970); see Wright v. Cradlebaugh, 3 Nev. 310, 316 (1867) (due process \u201cnot only requires that a party shall be properly brought into court, but that he shall have the opportunity when in court to establish any fact which, according to the usages of common law or the provisions of the constitution would be a protection to himself or his property\u201d).\nWe hold that the screening panel statute meets the requirements of due process. First, this court has already determined, in the context of a declaratory judgment action:\nThe action of the screening panel does not involve the substantial right of any party to a medical malpractice action. If the plaintiff is unsuccessful in such an action, he may nonetheless pursue his suit to trial. If the defendant is unsuccessful, he may demand that his liability be determined at a trial.\nPhelps, 106 Nev. at 921, 803 P.2d at 1103. Second, as already discussed in detail in this opinion, a plaintiff is given the opportunity to cross-examine any and all of the defense witnesses and experts that were presented to the panel at trial. Moreover, a plaintiff can further point out to a jury that expert witnesses are being presented to the jury that were not presented to the screening panel. Further, a jury may accept or reject a screening panel\u2019s finding and the finding carries no more weight than that of a single item of evidence. These procedures provide ample due process to Barrett and other claimants, as a federal court in Nevada has already concluded:\nThe Nevada Screening Panel Statute, the preliminary procedures it dictates, and the admissibility of the Panel\u2019s finding without further compelled testimony from the panelists, do not deprive plaintiff of due process rights. The Panel\u2019s finding is only one piece of evidence to be weighed in light of all other evidence. There is no deprivation of a property interest as a result of the Panel\u2019s findings nor [do] the Panel decisions bind or impair the interests of the parties.\nHeredia v. Johnson, 835 F. Supp. 553, 554 (D. Nev. 1993).\nThus, we hold that the screening panel statute withstands constitutional scrutiny. Nevertheless, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of respondents on the basis of respondents\u2019 counsels\u2019 misconduct at trial.\n5. Misconduct of the Prevailing Party\nWe hold that the following conduct by respondents\u2019 lawyers constituted misconduct, which, when taken together, deprived Barrett of a fair trial. First, Dr. Bernstein\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Bernstein at trial for his opinion about the cause of death when he had specifically represented to Barrett\u2019s counsel at Dr. Bernstein\u2019s deposition that he would not ask that question at trial. Furthermore, during closing argument, Dr. Bernstein\u2019s counsel misstated Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony. Second, the Hospital\u2019s counsel, in a rhetorical flourish, improperly and prejudicially stated during closing argument that the compensation sought by Barrett included the \u201ckind of numbers that necessitate the high health care cost in this country.\u201d See Davidoff v. Segert, 551 So. 2d 1274 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (holding that remarks made by defense counsel to the jury during closing argument in a personal injury action regarding the \u201cinsurance crisis\u201d warrant the granting of a n\u00e9w trial). Third, during closing argument, Dr. Brown\u2019s counsel showed opposing counsel one photograph, to which counsel had no objection, and then surreptitiously showed a different photograph to the jury. Fourth, Dr. Brown\u2019s counsel conducted a water balloon demonstration during opening argument and referred to it in closing argument when no foundation had been laid for the demonstration.\nNRCP 59(a)(2) provides that a new trial may be granted due to misconduct of the prevailing party. A new trial based upon the prevailing party\u2019s misconduct does not require proof that the result would have been different in the first trial without such misconduct. The United States Supreme Court has held that the litigant whose counsel has engaged in misconduct is not entitled to \u201cthe benefit of calculation, which can be little better than speculation, as to the extent of the wrong inflicted upon his opponent.\u201d Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie Ry. Co. v. Moquin, 283 U.S. 520, 521-22 (1931). Nevertheless, \u201c[t]o warrant reversal on grounds of attorney misconduct, the \u2018flavor of misconduct must sufficiently permeate an entire proceeding to provide conviction that the jury was influenced by passion and prejudice in reaching its verdict.\u2019 \u201d Kehr v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., Inc., 736 F.2d 1283, 1286 (9th Cir. 1984) (quoting Standard Oil of California v. Perkins, 347 F.2d 379, 388 (9th Cir. 1965)). We hold that the cumulative effect of the aforementioned incidents of misconduct permeated the entire proceeding such that the jury was improperly influenced in reaching its verdict. Time and time again respondents\u2019 lawyers pushed the limits of propriety.\nAccordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and award of attorney fees.\nNRS 41A.049(2) states in pertinent part: \u201cThe screening panel shall consider all the documentary material, including the complaint, answer and response, health care records and records of a hospital or office and the testimony of any expert witnesses the panel considers necessary. ...\u201d NRS 41A.016(2) states:\nThe written findings of the screening panel are admissible in any action concerning the complaint which is subsequently filed in district court. No other evidence concerning the screening panel or its deliberations is admissible and no member of the screening panel may be called to testify in any such action.\nThe right to a jury trial under the Nevada Constitution is coextensive with that guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Blanton v. North Las Vegas Mun. Ct., 103 Nev. 623, 628-29, 748 P.2d 494, 497 (1987), aff\u2019d, Blanton v. City of North Las Vegas, Nev., 489 U.S. 538 (1989). The constitutional right to a jury trial in Nevada confirms and secures the right as it existed at common law. Id. at 628, 748 P.2d at 497.\nSee In re Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 310 (1920) (the Constitution mandates \u201cmerely that enjoyment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and that the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be not interfered with\u201d).\nNRS 41A.069 provides:\nIn any action for medical malpractice tried before a jury, the following instructions must be given:\n1. If testimony of a medical expert was given at the review by the screening panel:\nDuring the course of this trial certain evidence was admitted concerning the findings of a screening panel. The findings of the panel were based upon a review of medical records and the testimony of a medical expert based upon his review of those records. These findings are to be given the same weight as any other evidence,' but are not conclusive on your determination of the case.\n2. If testimony of a medical expert was not given at the review by the screening panel:\nDuring the course of this trial certain evidence was admitted concerning the findings of a screening panel. The findings of the panel were based solely upon a review of the medical records. These findings are to be given the same weight as any other evidence, but are not conclusive on your determination of the case.\n(Emphasis added.)\nIn the instant case, the jury was not only given the standard statutory instruction that the panel findings \u201care to be given the same weight as any other evidence [and] are not conclusive on your determination,\u201d but was also instructed that the screening panel \u201cis a summary process to screen those frivolous and marginal cases. It is not a full trial and is not to be considered by you as a substitute for a full trial.\u201d In response to defense arguments highlighting the panel findings, Barrett\u2019s counsel stressed the limitations of the panel procedure during argument:\nThere\u2019s no live testimony before that screening panel. There\u2019s an affidavit submitted and medical records. There\u2019s no cross-examination, which as we have seen in this trial, is the foundation for truth. Since the Medical/Legal Screening Panel made its decision we have taken 50 depositions. . . . [T]he depositions you saw stacked up here for the last three weeks, all that information was acquired subsequent to the panel\u2019s finding. . . .\nIn her reply brief, Barrett implies that it is improper for an expert, the panel in this case, to make a determination on the ultimate issue \u2014 negligence. This implication is groundless. In Nevada, as in most jurisdictions, experts may give opinions as to ultimate issues. NRS 41 A. 100, 50.295.\nDuring oral argument, Barrett\u2019s counsel indicated that the decision of the first screening panel was based on evidence that the defendants in the first panel blamed Mr. Barrett\u2019s complications and death on the malpractice of the defendants in the second panel, and that the decision of the second panel was based on evidence that the defendants in the second panel likewise blamed the defendants in the first panel for malpractice. This information is not in the record on appeal, but if this were the case, fairness to the plaintiff would require that the jury be given this information. If all the defendants concede that malpractice occurred, but that it was committed by someone else, the jury would be entitled to receive this information.\nNRS 41A.056(2) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the determination is not in favor of the claimant, the claimant may file an action in court.\u201d\nSee Seoane v. Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 660 F.2d 146, 149 (5th Cir. 1981); Woods v. Holy Cross Hospital, 591 F.2d 1164, 1179-80 (5th Cir. 1979); Hines v. Elkhart General Hospital, 465 F. Supp. 421, 426-27 (N.D. Ind.), aff\u2019d 603 F.2d 646 (7th Cir. 1979); Keyes v. Humana Hosp. Alaska, Inc., 750 P.2d 343, 347 (Alaska 1988); McCarthy v. Mensch, 412 So. 2d 343, 346 (Fla.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 833 (1982); Johnson v. St. Vincent Hospital, Inc., 404 N.E.2d 585, 593 (Ind. 1980); Everett v. Goldman, 359 So. 2d 1256, 1269 (La. 1978); Linder v. Smith, 629 P.2d 1187, 1190 (Mont. 1981); Prendergast v. Nelson, 256 N.W.2d 657, 665-66 (Neb. 1977); Suchit v. Baxt, 423 A.2d 670, 674 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1980); Treyball v. Clark, 483 N.E.2d 1136, 1137 (N.Y. 1985); Halpern v. Gozan, 381 N.Y.S.2d 744, 748 (Sup. Ct. 1976); Beatty v. Akron City Hospital, 424 N.E.2d 586, 589-91 (Ohio 1981); State ex rel. Strykowski v. Wilkie, 261 N.W.2d 434, 452 (Wis. 1978).\nUnder analogous circumstances, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a provision permitting the introduction of the prior findings and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in a civil action by a shipper against a carrier does not violate the right to jury trial. The Court stated:\nThis provision only establishes a rebuttable presumption. It cuts off no defense, interposes no obstacle to a full contestation of all the issues, and takes no question of fact from either court or jury. At most therefore it is merely a rule of evidence. It does not abridge the right of trial by jury or take away any of its incidents.\nMeeker v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 236 U.S. 412, 430 (1915).\nNRS 41A.056(2) provides:\nIf the determination is not in favor of the claimant, the claimant may file an action in court. If the claimant does not obtain a judgment in his favor in court, the defendant must be awarded reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred after the date of filing the action in court.\nThis argument can be characterized as a substantive due process argument as well as a right to a jury trial argument.\nThere is a question whether the $876,604.72 attorney fees judgment in this case constitutes \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees as required by NRS 41A.056(2). However, in view of our disposition of this case, we need not consider this issue.\nThe Rowe court pointed to a number of rational bases the Florida legislature might have had for enacting its medical malpractice attorney fees statute:\n[T]he award of [attorney fees] is intended not only to discourage meritless claims, but also to make the prevailing plaintiff or defendant whole. It can be argued that, rather than deterring plaintiffs from litigating, the statute could actually encourage plaintiffs to proceed with well-founded malpractice claims that would otherwise be ignored because they are not economically feasible under the contingent fee system. The statute may encourage an initiating party to consider carefully the likelihood of success before bringing an action, and similarly encourage a defendant to evaluate the same factor in determining how to proceed once an action is filed. We reject the argument that [the statute] so deters the pursuit of medical malpractice claims that it effectively denies access to the courts to either party in malpractice actions.\n472 So. 2d at 1149.\nUnlike the cases Barrett\u2019s amici cite in their brief, the screening panel attorney fees provision presents no obstacle to commence a lawsuit or obtain a de novo trial.\nAt least four members of the panel must agree on the \u201cno reasonable probability\u201d finding. NRS 41A.049(6). If four members do not so agree, \u201cthe screening panel shall be deemed unable to reach a decision on the issue and shall make a finding to that effect.\u201d Id. Under such circumstances, the claimant may file a civil action, but is not subject to an award of attorney fees if he or she loses at trial. NRS 41A.056(3), 41A.049(5)(c).\nBarrett\u2019s amici also make various empirical claims to bolster their arguments. In assessing the constitutionality of NRS 41A.056, this court is bound to evaluate the provision as enacted and cannot consider its effectiveness in achieving its goals. See Allen v. State Pub. Emp. Ret. Bd., 100 Nev. 130, 676 P.2d 792 (1984). Thus, evidence concerning the impact of the attorney fees provision is immaterial to the constitutional analysis and we do not address amici\u2019s empirical claims nor respondents\u2019 attempts to refute those claims.\nThe voluminous legislative history of the statute accompanied the \u201cBrief of Attorney General on Issue of the Unconstitutionality of the Nevada Medical Legal Screening Panel Statute.\u201d Pursuant to stipulation of all parties, the Attorney General was permitted to intervene for a limited purpose after Barrett raised the constitutionality issue in her motion for a new trial.\nCourts of other states have held that malpractice screening panel legislation may cover fewer than all health care providers without offending equal protection. See, e.g., Borja v. Phoenix General Hosp., Inc., 727 P.2d 355, 358 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1986); State ex rel. Schneider v. Liggett, 576 P.2d 221, 229 (Kan.), appeal dismissed, Liggett v. Kansas, ex rel.Schneider, 439 U.S. 808 (1978); Everett v. Goldman, 359 So.2d 1256, 1265 (La. 1978); Prendergast v. Nelson, 256 N.W.2d 657, 667 (Neb. 1977); State ex rel. Strykowski v. Wilkie, 261 N.W.2d 434, 444 (Wis. 1978).\nArticle 3, Section 1 of the Nevada Constitution states:\nThe powers of the Government of the State of Nevada shall be divided into three separate departments, \u2014 the Legislative, \u2014 the Executive and the Judicial; and no persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any functions, appertaining to either of the others, except in the cases herein expressly directed or permitted.\nBarrett\u2019s amici maintain that NRS 41 A.056(2) violates medical malpractice claimants\u2019 due process rights because (1) there is no opportunity to challenge the panel\u2019s \u201cno reasonable probability\u201d finding, and (2) the trial judge has no discretion to deny an award of fees. Amici\u2019s claims are meritless.\nAmici suggest that a claimant must be provided with an opportunity to appeal the panel\u2019s negative finding because that finding may ultimately provide the basis for an award of attorney fees and costs under NRS 41 A. 056(2). However, where a full and fair hearing is provided, due process\ndoes not require that appellate review be provided. Jackson Water Works, Inc. v. Public Utilities Comm\u2019n of State of Cal., 793 F.2d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1102 (1987). While the screening panel statute does not provide a direct appeal from the panel determination, it provides something better \u2014 a de novo trial.\nMore fundamentally, amici\u2019s due process claim ignores the fact that it is not the panel finding, but the final jury verdict, that triggers the fee award. Had the legislature chosen to do so, it could have skipped the panel finding entirely and simply provided for an award of fees to the prevailing party in all medical malpractice actions. Florida\u2019s statute did just this; it provided that a trial court must award a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to the prevailing party in a medical malpractice action. Florida Patient\u2019s Compensation Fund v. Rowe, 472 So. 2d 1145, 1146 (Fla. 1985). As noted already, this statute passed constitutional muster. Id. at 1149.\nAmici also argue that the screening panel statute\u2019s attorney fees provision violates due process because the trial court has no discretion to deny an award of fees where such an award would be unjust. The case amici cite in support of this claim involved a statute containing a specific \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d provision. Arbuckle v. Com., Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, 478 A.2d 545 (Pa. 1984). NRS 41A.056, like many other fee-shifting provisions, only requires an award of fees that the court determines reasonable. Generally, the court will set an award only after the parties have had a full opportunity to debate the merits and amount of the award. This is precisely what occurred here. Thus, we conclude that the attorney fees provision is in complete compliance with the requirements of due process.\nThe screening panel statute even provides for several peremptory challenges of potential panel members and an unlimited number of challenges for cause. NRS 41 A.043.\nWhile we believe Dr. Brown\u2019s counsel\u2019s characterization that he wanted to illustrate to the jury \u201cthat words can be a matter of interpretation,\u201d what disturbs this court is that the switching of photographs was done in a conniving manner.\nEvidence of a test or a demonstration is not admissible unless the proponent makes a foundational showing of substantial similarity between the demonstration conducted and the actual conditions that existed at the time of the injury. Way v. Hayes, 89 Nev. 375, 377, 513 P.2d 1222, 1223 (1973). Counsel did not satisfy these requirements.",
