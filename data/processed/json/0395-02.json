        "text": "WILLIAMSON, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of divorce in favor of the wife against the husband on the ground of cruel and abusive treatment. The appeal is sustained.\nIn reviewing the record, we have in mind the familiar principle that the findings of fact of a Justice sitting without a jury stand unless clearly erroneous. M.R. C.P. Rule 52(a); Gruber v. Gruber, 161 Me. 289, 211 A.2d 583.\nThe parties were married in 1961 and have two children. The first knowledge that the wife sought a divorce was when she caused the summons to be served upon her husband at their home in June 1965. He was, his wife agreed, a \u201csteady earner\u201d. The Justice on motion of the husband filed special findings of fact and conclusions of law as follows:\n\u201cFirst, this matter was tried at great length. The plaintiff produced the testimony of herself and four witnesses in her behalf and the defendant in contesting the divorce produced himself and one witness.\n\u201cIt would serve no useful purpose to rehearse the unhappy story of this ill-starred marriage. Its inauspicious beginning well forecast its unhappy ending.\n\u201cUpon all of the evidence I find as a fact that, with the exception of a very short interval of time following its celebration, this marriage was in most respects unhappy and reflects an increasing addiction by the husband to drinking habits which, while possibly falling short of gross and confirmed habits of intoxication, certainly in their effect upon domestic affairs amounted to cruel and abusive treatment, and I find the protestations of the defendant to the contrary unconvincing. No single factual claim on the part of the plaintiff standing alone supports her claim, but in aggregate they reflect a course of conduct indicating a disposition on the part of the defendant to demand, as of right, the love he deigned to win, and I rule as a matter of law that a prolonged course of conduct displeasing and injurious to the plaintiff\u2019s health and domestic security and that of her children totals in its aggregate cruel and abusive treatment as a matter of law. I disbelieve the defendant\u2019s protestation of condoning intercourse and find his denials of his drinking habits unconvincing.\u201d\nThe evidence fully warrants a finding of \u201can increasing addiction by the husband to drinking habits.\u201d The record does not show gross and confirmed habits of intoxication, and indeed the wife does not ground her claim of divorce on such cause.\nDrinking plays a heavy role in divorce as every Justice knows. This is not to say, however, that excessive drinking alone amounts to cruel and abusive treatment. Here we are unable to find any evidence that the drinking habits of the husband resulted in the injury to the wife, either mentally or physically, sufficient to come within the statutory cause of cruel and abusive treatment.\nThe Court then finds \u201ca prolonged course of conduct displeasing and injurious to the plaintiff\u2019s health and domestic security and that of her children totals in its aggregate cruel and abusive treatment as a matter of law.\u201d\nIn our view of the record the facts as a matter of law do not warrant the ultimate finding.\nThe wife\u2019s reasons for seeking a divorce were stated by her in these words:\n\u201cQ So you informed him your reasons for seeking a divorce were threefold: that he didn\u2019t take you out, that he saw too much of John Mc-Keen and drank too much ?\n\u201cA Yes.\u201d\nThe husband never physically abused his wife. She testified:\n\u201cQ On these occasions when you say he had something to drink, has he been rough with you?\n\u201cA No, I don\u2019t think he would dare to get rough with me.\n\u201cQ You do not want to give him credit for anything, but I ask you: has he ever been rough with you at all ?\n\u201cA Not physically.\u201d\n\u201cQ My question is: you never thought he was going to strike you?\n\u201cA I don\u2019t think he would dare to hit me because he knows I would hit him back.\n\u201cQ He never so much as gave you a shove ?\n\u201cA No.\u201d\nHis conduct had effect and no more on her health, mental or physical, as stated in the following testimony:\n[the wife]\n\u201cQ What was his condition when he returned at night?\n\u201cA He had been drinking, very much.\n\u201cQ And how did this affect you at that time, physically and emotionally ?\u201d\n\u201cA I lost quite a bit of weight. I had a doctor\u2019s prescription for my nerves at that time.\n\u201cQ How long has this condition continued ?\n\u201cA It bothers occasionally at present. I have a prescription.\u201d\nMrs. McKeen buttressed the wife\u2019s testimony as follows:\n\u201cQ Mrs. McKeen, when was it that you saw Gloria and you noticed she had lost weight?\n\u201cA It was either in May or June.\n\u201cQ Has she lost weight since then ?\n\u201cA I would say so, yes.\u201d\n* * * * * *\n\u201cQ When you saw her in May or June of this year, she appeared to you on that one occasion to have lost some weight from when you had seen her two or three years ago?\n\u201cA Yes, I think so.\u201d\nWe are unable to read into the evidence anything more than the history of an unhappy marriage. The conduct of the husband no doubt contributed to the unhappiness, but unhappiness of wife or husband or both is not cause for divorce under our statutes.\nProtestations that the wife had condoned any cause for divorce between the period of bringing the complaint and the hearing were not believed by the presiding Justice, and this finding stands as the fact.\nThe case of the wife must be measured by the evidence submitted of cruel and abusive treatment on the husband\u2019s part. We are forced to conclude that the findings of cruel and abusive treatment by the Court were clearly erroneous under the standard stated in Gruber v. Gruber, supra, in which we said 161 Me. at p. 293, 211 A.2d at p. 585:\n\u201cA plaintiff in a divorce action, relying upon the grounds of cruel and abusive treatment, must, by a preponderance of the evidence, prove two elements: (1) the cruel and abusive conduct of .plaintiff\u2019s spouse, and (2) that such conduct caused the plaintiff physical or mental injury or that a continuation of the marriage relationship would jeopardize physical or mental health. Failure to prove either or both is fatal.\u201d\nThe entry will be\nAppeal sustained.",
