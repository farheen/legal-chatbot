        "text": "FRIEDMAN, Judge.\nOccidental Chemical Company (Employer) petitions this court for review of that portion of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) reversing the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) that granted Employer a credit for Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) payments made to William Knight (Claimant). We affirm.\nIn 1992, Claimant filed a Claim Petition alleging that he sustained a work-related injury to his left knee and leg in mid to late January of 1992. (R.R. at 40R.) Employer filed an answer denying the aver-ments in Claimant\u2019s Claim Petition. While Claimant was on layoff status, Employer made SUB payments to Claimant. Following hearings, the WCJ granted Claimant\u2019s Claim Petition, awarding Claimant on-going benefits and retroactive benefits for past disability. (WCJ\u2019s Dec. 27, 1994, Conclusions of Law, No. 2.)\nEmployer appealed the WCJ\u2019s decision to the WCAB. Although posing no challenge to the award of benefits, Employer argued that the WCJ did not rule on Employer\u2019s request for a credit for SUB payments made to Claimant. The WCAB concluded that additional findings of fact were necessary and remanded the case to the WCJ for further findings of fact concerning the SUB pay and for a determination of whether Employer was entitled to a credit for SUB payments. (WCAB op., June 5,1996, at 6.)\nAt the hearing on remand before the WCJ, Employer presented the credible testimony of Cynthia Alex Paladino (Pala-dino), Employer\u2019s human resources supervisor. Paladino testified that SUB pay is a benefit, funded solely by Employer, which Employer provides to its hourly employees pursuant to the Supplementary Unemployment Benefits Agreement, a negotiated collective bargaining agreement (Agreement). (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 1; R.R. at 159R.) Paladino explained that employees accrue half a credit unit for each work week, including weeks they are not working, so long as they are receiving pay from Employer. (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, Nos. 2, 8; R.R. at 160R, 273R.) Paladino stated that Claimant was accruing credits while receiving benefits and had accrued the maximum of 209 credit units, of which Claimant had used ninety-six credit units. (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, Nos. 7, 8; R.R. at 273R.)\nPaladino stated that an employee who is not working is considered to be in one of the following three categories: (i) layoff, (ii) on workers\u2019 compensation or (iii) out sick for non-work-related reasons. (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 3; R.R. at 161R.) Paladino explained that Employer makes SUB payments only to those employees who are on layoff status as defined in the Agreement; if an employee is receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits or sickness and accident benefits, SUB pay does not apply. (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 3; R.R. at 161R-62R, 274R.) Therefore, Paladino testified that, if Employer had paid Claimant workers\u2019 compensation benefits immediately, Employer would not have made SUB payments to Claimant. (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 4.) However, because Claimant was originally laid off from work and, later, was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits retroactively, Employer paid Claimant a total of $37,927.96 in SUB pay from March 1993 through January 22, 1995. (WCJ\u2019s Sept. 17,1997, Findings of Fact, Nos. 4-5.)\nBased on the Agreement, the WCJ concluded that Claimant was not entitled to receive both SUB pay and workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The WCJ stated that to conclude otherwise would allow Claimant to receive a double recovery, which the Agreement did not intend. Accordingly, the WCJ credited Employer for the SUB payments made to Claimant during the period that Claimant was entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Claimant appealed the WCJ\u2019s decision to the WCAB.\nOn appeal, the WCAB reversed that portion of the WCJ\u2019s decision granting Employer a credit for the SUB payments. The WCAB determined that the SUB payments were payments in the nature of wages earned and not in lieu of compensation, and, thus, Claimant would have been entitled to the SUB payments regardless of whether he had a compensable injury.\nOn appeal, Employer argues that it is entitled to a credit for SUB payments made to Claimant prior to the award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and that the WCAB erred in ruling otherwise. We disagree.\nIn determining whether Employer is entitled to a credit for the SUB payments made, this court must decide if the payments are in the nature of wages or if the payments are in lieu of compensation. See Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Gounaris), 714 A.2d 550 (Pa.Cmwlth.), appeal denied, 557 Pa. 641, 732 A.2d 1211 (1998); see also Toborkey v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (H.J.Heinz), 655 A.2d 636 (Pa.Cmwlth.), appeal denied, 541 Pa. 655, 664 A.2d 544 (1995), Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 65 Pa.Cmwlth. 119, 441 A.2d 1364 (1982). If the SUB pay is an accrued entitlement which has been built up as a result of Claimant\u2019s services for Employer, Employer is not entitled to a credit for those payments. See Toborkey (quoting Hildebrand v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Fire Department/City of Reading), 111 Pa.Cmwlth. 24, 532 A.2d 1287 (1987)). If, on the other hand, the SUB payments were made in relief of Claimant\u2019s inability to labor, Employer will be entitled to a credit. See id. After reviewing the facts of this case, we conclude that SUB payments are not in lieu of compensation and are in the nature of wages.\nFirst, we note that \u201c \u2018in lieu of compensation\u2019 does not mean \u2018by way of compensation\u2019 \u201d but \u201cmeans \u2018in place of or \u2018instead of.\u201d Creighton v. Continental Roll and Steel Foundry Co., 155 Pa.Super. 165, 38 A.2d 337 (1944). Here, Employer\u2019s SUB plan states that the purpose of the plan is to \u201csupplement State System Benefits and not to replace or duplicate them.\u201d (R.R. at 90R.) From this language, we discern that the SUB payments are not intended to be in place of, or in lieu of, compensation. See WbbsteR\u2019s Third New International DictionaRY 1925 (1986) (defining replace as \u201cto put in place of\u2019). In addition, Paladino testified that only those nonworking employees on layoff status, such as Claimant, are eligible for SUB pay. Here, Claimant was medically restricted and awaiting suitable employment and, thus, was laid off. Clearly, that does not mean that Claimant was unable to labor. Therefore, because the SUB payments were not intended to be in place of compensation and because they were not paid based on Claimant\u2019s inability to labor, Employer is not entitled to a credit. See Toborkey.\nFurther, we conclude that, as a benefit which Claimant had accrued based on work performed for Employer, Employer\u2019s SUB payments are in the nature of wages. Specifically, Paladino testified that each hourly employee accrues half a credit unit for each work week and that Claimant had accrued the maximum benefit of 209 credit units. Accordingly, Employer is not entitled to a credit. See id.\nEmployer, however, argues that it should receive a credit because the credit units are not an exhaustible source or fund due to the fact that the credits cannot be redeemed or exchanged into a \u201ccash benefit.\u201d We disagree that Claimant\u2019s inability to redeem credit units for cash entitles Employer to a credit. The fact remains that, here, Claimant, whose absence relates to a compensable injury, was forced to deplete ninety-six credit units of an exhaustible benefit which would otherwise have remained available to him in the event of a future lay-off. See Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. Olivetti Corporation of America, 26 Pa.Cmwlth. 464, 364 A.2d 735 (1976). In such an instance, the employer is not entitled to a credit. Id. To award Employer a credit for the period during which Claimant depleted accrued benefits would make Claimant bear the cost of that period of his work-related disability. See Toborkey. Such a result is contrary to the purposes of the Act. See id.\nAccordingly, we affirm the order of the WCAB.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 18th day of July, 2000, the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, dated December 80, 1999, at No. A97-4311, is hereby affirmed.\nPresident Judge DOYLE dissents.\n. We note that some of the documents filed in this case refer to the employer as Occidental Chemical Corp.\n. Claimant was medically restricted and awaiting suitable employment. (See R.R. at 86R.) Pursuant to the Supplementary Unem-ploymenl Benefits Agreement, a negotiated collective bargaining agreement, \u2018\u2018[m]edically restricted [e]mployees awaiting suitable placement will be considered on layoff occurring in a reduction in force.\" (R.R. at 88R.)\n. Employer determines the amount to invest for each employee by multiplying the number of payroll hours by the accrual rate. (WCJ's Findings of Fact, No. 1; R.R. at 160R.)\n. Our scope of review is limited to determining whether an error of law was committed, whether constitutional rights were violated or whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Section 704 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704, Toborkey v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (H.J.Heinz), 655 A.2d 636 (Pa.Cmwlth.), appeal denied, 541 Pa. 655, 664 A.2d 544 (1995).\n. Alternatively, Employer argues that it has a right of subrogation to the SUB payments. Although they overlap in some cases, the concepts of credit and subrogation are distinct. See Boeing Helicopters v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Cobb), 713 A.2d 1181 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1998). The concept of subrogation is found in section 319 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act), Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 671. One of the requirements in section 319 is that the right of subrogation must be agreed to by the parties or \"established at the time of the hearing before the referee [now WCJ] or the board.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 671. Here, the Employer did not establish its right of subrogation at the hearing before the WCJ. (See Hearing Transcript, January 25, 1993, R.R. at 96R-140R.) Thus, we will confine our discussion to whether Employer is entitled to a credit.\n. Employer testified that the SUB credits are not redeemable for any other benefits, such as vacation pay or retirement benefits, and that the SUB automatically terminates with no payout for any units \"accrued\u201d when the employee retires or his or her employment terminates.
