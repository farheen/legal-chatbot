        "text": "WERNICK, Justice.\nOn November 26, 1974, the Machias School Committee, after finding that plaintiff David G. McLaughlin was unfit to teach and that his services were unprofitable to the Machias Schools, issued a certificate of dismissal against him, pursuant to 20 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 473(4). In accordance with Rule 80B M.R.Civ.P., plaintiff, in December 1974, sought judicial review of the School Committee\u2019s decision by filing a complaint in the Superior Court (Washington County) against the Committee as defendant. Plaintiff claimed the Committee had unlawfully terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment as a teacher and coach at the Machias Memorial High School. In the course of these proceedings, after various affidavits had been filed, plaintiff moved for summary judgment in his favor. Evaluating plaintiff\u2019s motion, the presiding Justice concluded that defendant, not plaintiff, was entitled to summary judgment and, pursuant to Rule 56(c) M.R.Civ.P., the Justice ordered entry of judgment for defendant. Plaintiff has appealed from said judgment, as entered.\nWe deny plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\nFrom 1970 to 1974 plaintiff taught physical education and coached several team sports at the Machias Memorial High School. By 1974 plaintiff had compiled an outstanding personal record at the school and had become a tenured teacher.\nOn October 16, 1974, plaintiff participated in a \u201cpick-up\u201d basketball game at the Machias High School with a number of students. Adverse weather conditions had caused cancellation of a late afternoon soccer practice, and plaintiff had organized the basketball game for the group on a voluntary basis. During the game, while plaintiff was in the act of shooting for a basket, a student pushed plaintiff from behind. Plaintiff immediately turned around and with a single blow of an open hand struck the student on his right cheek bone. The blow caused closure of the student\u2019s mouth and, in consequence, the student lost one of his teeth and suffered serious damage to another tooth. He also sustained a bloody nose and a black eye. After the incident, which lasted only a few seconds, plaintiff administered first aid to the student and drove him home.\nAt the hearing before the School Committee, plaintiff admitted that he had intended to cuff the student lightly on the top of the head but denied that he had intended to cause any damage. The student testified that the teacher struck him on purpose and in anger. The Superintendent of Schools expressed his opinion that plaintiff would not be able to perform in the school as effectively as before the incident. He explained that a coach or physical education teacher must teach by example as well as by discussion.\nIn its certificate of dismissal, the School Committee stated:\n\u201cHaving held ... [a] hearing and after due deliberation, the undersigned, constituting the Machias School Committee do find that the said Mr. David McLaughlin did on October 16, 1974 in the high school gymnasium strike a student, Chris Gaudette, without justification and with such force that the said Chris Gaudette sustained serious physical injury, to wit: loss of one tooth and serious physical damage to another tooth.\n\u201cThe Undersigned, constituting the Mac-hias School Committee, further conclude that the charge preferred by the Superintendent is true; that Mr. David McLaughlin\u2019s action in striking the said Chris Gaudette renders the said David McLaughlin unfit to teach and his services, by reason of said action, are deemed unprofitable to the Machias Schools; and, therefore, pursuant to Title 20, Me.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 473.4, and based on each and both of said statutory grounds, for the reasons stated herein, Mr. David McLaughlin is hereby dismissed.\u201d\n1.\nPlaintiff contends that the evidence in the record is insufficient to support the Committee\u2019s finding that, within the meaning of 20 M.R.S.A. 7 473(4), plaintiff is \u201cunfit to teach\u201d and his \u201cservices\u201d have become \u201cunprofitable\u201d to the school.\nSection 473 provides:\n\u201cSuperintending school committees and school directors shall perform the following duties:\n\u201c4. Teachers dismissed. After investigation, due notice of hearing, and hearing thereon, they shall dismiss any teacher, although having the requisite certificate, who proves unfit to teach or whose services they deem unprofitable to the school; and give to said teacher a certificate of dismissal and of the reasons therefor, a copy of which they shall retain. . .\u201d\nIn Wright v. Superintending School Committee, City of Portland, Me., 331 A.2d 640, 647 (1975) we decided that the \u201csingle, isolated instance of \u2018grave lack of judgment\u2019 there involved could not in the particular circumstances presented \u201cconstitute \u2018unfitness to teach\u2019 within the intendment of 20 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 473(4).\u201d In footnote 3 of the opinion we took the precaution to emphasize that\n\u201c[w]e do not mean to say that a single incident can never constitute \u2018unfitness to teach.\u2019 The facts of each case must be evaluated in terms of whether the character and degree of the act have so impaired the services of the teacher in properly instructing his students that he may be said to be incapable of or unsuited to teaching.\u201d\nHere, in contrast to the situation in Wright, supra, the misconduct of the teacher pertains directly to his teaching position and performance. - Cf. Fernald v. City of Ellsworth Superintending School Committee, Me., 342 A.2d 704, 708 (1975). The example set by a coach or physical education teacher is critical to his \u201coverall impact\u201d on impressionable young athletes, particularly at a time when the malady of violence jeopardizes the benefits to be derived from teaching competitive sports. Physical education teachers and coaches of high school athletes and students must have, an exceptional ability to control the emotion, excitement and zeal involved in competitive sporting endeavors. The value of teaching physical education, fair play and good sportsmanship may be permanently impaired when the personal conduct of a teacher-coach conflicts with the message his teaching should impart. The teacher\u2019s actions may speak more loudly than his words. In addition, a single act of violence in the setting of a competitive sport may cause serious injury or provoke a violent response.\nIt is of no moment whether we might have decided differently had we been the tribunal responsible for decision in the first instance. The scope of our appellate review is confined to the question whether, on all the evidence in accordance with a correct application of legal principles, there was a rational basis for the decision made by the Machias School Committee. We conclude that there was such warrant for the Committee\u2019s determination.\n2.\nWe turn to plaintiff\u2019s other contention on appeal, that the Court erred in ordering summary judgment for defendant because genuine issues of material fact existed in relation to whether the Machias School Committee (1) was an impartial tribunal and (2) conducted the plaintiff\u2019s hearing in conformity to the constitutional requirements of procedural due process of law. Specifically, plaintiff contends that the Committee was biased against him and purported to act, by virtue of the manner in which the Committee\u2019s attorney functioned, as both prosecutor and judge of plaintiff.\nWe will not give these contentions appellate cognizance because plaintiff did not adequately save them for our appellate scrutiny. Plaintiff did not raise the issues at the proceedings before the School Committee. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney never mentioned the dual role in which the attorney for the School Committee appeared to be acting, and, indeed, he stated expressly that he had no objection to any procedural matters. The failure to raise issues of procedural due process at the hearing before the School Committee ordinarily constitutes a waiver of those issues. See Beattie v. Roberts, 436 F.2d 747 (1st Cir. 1971); McDonough v. Kelly, 329 F.Supp. 144 (D.N.H. 1971); Erb v. Iowa State Board of Public Instruction, 216 N.W.2d 339 (Iowa 1974). In the circumstances of this case we conclude that plaintiff acquiesced in all procedural matters related to the hearing before the School Committee. As to the claim of the School Committee\u2019s bias, plaintiff\u2019s attorney was permitted to question the Committee members in regard to their impartiality, and he indicated at the time that he was satisfied with their response that they had not prejudged the case.\nThe entry is:\nAppeal denied.\nJudgment affirmed.\nDELAHANTY and NICHOLS, JJ., did not sit.\n. The individual members of the School Committee in their capacities as such Committee members were also named as defendants. Since the case involves the Committee\u2019s action, we treat the School Committee as if a single defendant.\n. In a cross-appeal defendant challenges the Superior Court\u2019s ruling excluding from evidence certain paragraphs of the affidavits of the School Committee members. Since we deny plaintiffs appeal, we do not reach this issue raised by the cross-appeal.\n. Plaintiff also claims that the certificate of dismissal lacks factual findings adequate to support the determination that plaintiff is unfit to teach or his services are unprofitable to the school. We find that the certificate of dismissal does contain findings of fact sufficient to allow for meaningful judicial review of the Committee\u2019s determination. The Committee was not required to elaborate on the argumentative significance of certain facts in relation to the statutory criteria applicable in the dismissal proceedings. The findings of fact set forth in the certificate, if supported by the evidence, sufficiently constitute the statutory ground for dismissal prescribed in \u00a7 473(4). See Fernald v. City of Ellsworth Superintending School Committee, Me., 342 A.2d 704, 707 (1975).",
