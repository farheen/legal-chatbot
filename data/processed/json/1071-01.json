        "text": "REID, Associate Judge:\nThis case involves a challenge to a tax deed issued by the District of Columbia government under D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1303.04 (2001), after an agent of appellant Scoville Street Corporation (\u201cScoville\u201d) disclaimed any interest in the underlying property, and a default judgment was entered in behalf of appellee District TLC Trust, 1996 (\u201cDistrict TLC\u201d). Scoville, which later sought to reclaim the property in question by bringing an action against District TLC and others, including the District of Columbia government, appeals from the trial court\u2019s order granting judgment in its lawsuit to appellees District TLC, et al., on their motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court treated as a motion for summary judgment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\nFACTUAL SUMMARY\nThe record on appeal shows that Scoville previously owned property located at 421 Massachusetts Avenue and 423 Massachusetts Avenue, in the'Northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. Scoville was once solely owned by Jerry Sills. During Jerry Sills\u2019 sole ownership, municipal liens were placed against both properties due to nonpayment of taxes for tax years 1992 through 1995. As a result of the unpaid liens, the properties were bid off and sold to the District of Columbia, which assigned its tax liens on both properties to District TLC in October 1996. Both tax lien certificates representing the assignments were recorded on November 20,1996.\nAfter Jerry Sills died in January 1996, his son, Kevin Sills, eventually became the manager of Scoville\u2019s properties. On March 6 and 7, 1997, Scoville was sent notice by certified mail that it had thirty days in which to pay the delinquent taxes and to redeem the respective properties, or to face foreclosure. When the taxes were not paid, District TLC'filed separate but virtually identical civil actions against Scoville on June 4, 1997, seeking to foreclose on the tax liens for both properties, and to preclude Scoville \u201cfrom all equity of redemption in and to\u201d the properties. Scoville did not lodge an answer to the complaint relating to the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue that is the subject of the case before us. Rather, Kevin Sills, as agent for Scoville, filed a disclaimer in August 1997, which states in relevant part:\nDefendant Kevin Sills, authorized agent on behalf of Scoville ..., hereby disclaims any and all rights, title, interest, lien or claim in or to the described real property that is the subject matter of this pleading [423 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.], and hereby declares that he will not defend said defendant in this action.\nFurther, Defendant Scoville ... prays the Court enters a decree accordingly without any cost against [it].\nKevin Sills signed a disclaimer not only for the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue, but also for the property at 421 Massachusetts Avenue. Prior to signing the disclaimers, he had performed a title search, and honestly believed that Scoville had no title to either property. However, he learned just prior to the trial court\u2019s March 1998 order that Scoville remained the record owner of the property at 421 Massachusetts Avenue. In April 1998, after Kevin Sills learned of the mistake regarding 421 Massachusetts Avenue, the parties filed a consent motion to strike the disclaimer. Subsequently, District TLC filed a motion for default judgment which was granted in March 1998 by the trial court. In its March 1998 order, the trial court declared that Scoville was \u201cbarred and foreclosed of and from all equity and right of redemption in and to the [property,\u201d and further, that District TLC \u201cshall.. .have the sole right to seek a[t]ax [d]eed for the [property....\u201d District TLC received the deed on March 24, 1998, but did not record it until February 14, 2001. In January 2001, prior to District TLC\u2019s recordation of the deed, Kevin Sills learned through the Urban Fund that Sco-ville remained the record owner of 423 Massachusetts Avenue.\nOn May 15, 2001, approximately three months after the tax deed for 423 Massachusetts Avenue was recorded, Scoville brought suit against District TLC and others, including the District of Columbia government, seeking to \u201cset aside\u201d the tax deed. Paragraph 12 of Scoville\u2019s complaint alleged that it had \u201cmistakenly disclaimed any interest in and to the [property,\u201d and paragraph 13 asserted that: \u201cSuch mistake relates to the death of the prior owner of [Scoville], the succession to the ownership of [Scoville] by the current owner thereof and a complete confusion as to the title to the [p]roperty.\u201d Three days after filing its lawsuit against District TLC, Scoville and District TLC settled the latter\u2019s lawsuit pertaining to 421 Massachusetts Avenue.\nIn the action filed by Scoville against it, District TLC moved for judgment on the pleadings on December 21, 2001; and Sco-ville filed an opposition. About one month later, on January 10, 2002, Scoville filed a motion to enforce an alleged settlement agreement which it claimed had been agreed to orally by the parties. Scoville maintained that the alleged oral agreement did not violate the Statute of Frauds. In addition, Scoville requested \u201cdiscovery and [ ] an evidentiary hearing on [its] Motion.\u201d On February 14, 2003, the trial court denied Scoville\u2019s motion to enforce settlement agreement; granted District TLC\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, treating it as a motion for summary judgment; and dismissed Scoville\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Scoville filed a timely appeal.\nANALYSIS\nScoville first argues that the trial court \u201ccommitted reversible error\u201d because it treated District TLC\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as one for summary judgment but without giving Scoville \u201cthe opportunity to supplement the record to be considered by [it].\u201d In seeking judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(c), District TLC referenced Scoville\u2019s complaint, the amended answer of the defendants, and the exhibits attached to the amended answer. These exhibits included the March 6 and 7, 1997 certified mail letters to Scoville containing notices as to the amount of delinquent taxes then due on the respective Massachusetts Avenue properties and the time period for redemption (thirty days); District TLC\u2019s complaints against Scoville pertaining to the Massachusetts Avenue properties; the results of a title search relating to the Massachusetts Avenue properties in question showing the recording of a tax lien certificate for each property on November 20, 1996; a copy of Kevin Sills\u2019 August 1997 disclaimer and the dismissal of District TLC\u2019s lawsuit against Scoville with regard to the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property; and the trial court\u2019s March 1998 order granting District TLC\u2019s motion for default judgment with respect to its lawsuit against Scoville, as to the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property. Attached to Scoville\u2019s opposition to District TLC\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings were affidavits from Kevin Sills regarding his disclaimer of interest in the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue, and his subsequent contract for the sale of that property, and from Karl Rice, Jerry Sills\u2019 attorney, who explained the difficulties in determining Jerry Sills\u2019 assets; a praecipe settling District TLC\u2019s suit against Scoville pertaining to the 421 Massachusetts Avenue property; and an April 27, 2001 letter from Scoville\u2019s attorney to District TLC\u2019s attorney seeking to redeem the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue, as it had done with respect to the property at 421 Massachusetts Avenue.\nSuper. Ct. Civ. R. 12(c) provides:\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the Court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\nHere, matters outside the pleadings were presented both by District TLC and Sco-ville, and were not excluded by the trial court. Rule 12(c) expressly states that under such circumstances the motion for judgment on the pleadings \u201cshall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 .... \u201d Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(c). We have stated previously that \u201c[t]he language of Rule 12 is mandatory.\u201d Foretich v. CBS, Inc., 619 A.2d 48, 55 (D.C.1993). Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court was required to treat District TLC\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment. The question thus is whether Scoville had \u201creasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\u201d Not only did Scoville have an opportunity to present all pertinent material, but it attached numerous exhibits to its opposition to District TLC\u2019s motion, including affidavits. In light of these submissions by Scoville, the trial court was not obligated to give specific notice of its intent to treat District TLC\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment, because Sco-ville had constructive notice that the Rule 12(c) motion might be converted to one for summary judgment; thus, any lack of additional notice did not prejudice Scoville. See San Pedro Hotel Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 159 F.3d 470, 477 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cA represented party who submits matters outside the pleadings to the judge and invites consideration of them has notice that the judge may use them to decide a motion originally noted as a motion to dismiss, requiring its transformation to a motion for summary judgment.\u201d) (quoting Grove v. Mead School Dist. No. 354, 753 F.2d 1528, 1582 (9th Cir.1985)); Angel v. Williams, 12 F.3d 786, 789 (8th Cir.1993) (where plaintiffs submitted materials in response to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, plaintiffs had constructive notice that motion would be converted); Alioto v. Marshall Field\u2019s & Co., 77 F.3d 934, 936 (7th Cir.1996) (one seeking to upset judgment resulting from improper conversion of 12(b)(6) motion to one for summary judgment must show that notice and an opportunity to respond would have mattered, that is, it would have precluded summary judgment); Nuclear Transp. Storage v. United States, 890 F.2d 1348, 1351 (6th Cir.1989) (conversion to summary judgment without usual notice to the parties is ground for reversal only when the conversion results in prejudice). Furthermore, nothing in the record shows that Seoville requested more time to present additional exhibits or affidavits. Hence, Scoville\u2019s complaint that the trial court improperly treated District TLC\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment is unavailing under the circumstances of this case.\nSeoville also contends that summary judgment was inappropriate in this case. \u201cIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we must assess the record independently ... [and view it] in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d Kelley v. Broadmoor Coop. Apartments, 676 A.2d 453, 456 (D.C.1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe will affirm the entry of summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id. (quoting Holland v. Hannan, 456 A.2d 807, 814 (D.C.1983)) (other citation and quotation marks omitted). See also Super. Ct. Civ. R. 56(c). Seoville asserts \u201cthat a material factual issue exists as to when Seoville knew or should have known of its mistake\u201d in disclaiming interest in the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property. He further maintains, in essence, that the trial court should have awaited the outcome of an evidentiary hearing on his January 2002 motion to enforce his alleged oral settlement agreement regarding the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property (essentially an alleged agreement allowing Seoville to match the highest bid that District TLC received in its efforts to sell the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property).\nD.C.Code \u00a7 47-1303.04(f)(2) and (4) (2001) provides:\n(2) Suits to contest the validity of the deed issued pursuant to this section may not be instituted and are forever barred if not filed within 90 days of recordation of the deed in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds ....\n(4) Upon the expiration of the 90-day period from the date of recordation of the deed, the validity of the deed, any other agreements relating thereto, and all proceedings in connection therewith shall be conclusively presumed not to have been legally taken and no court shall have the authority to inquire into such matters.\nSee Langon v. Reilly, 802 A.2d 951, 953-54 (D.C.2002). In light of \u00a7 47-1308.04(0(2) and (4) and the trial court\u2019s order of March 1998, granting District TLC\u2019s motion for default judgment against Scoville in its 1997 lawsuit, Scoville\u2019s arguments cannot prevail in the case before us. Sco-ville was notified by certified mail on March 7, 1997, that taxes were outstanding on the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property and that it had thirty days in which to pay the outstanding taxes and to redeem the property, to avoid foreclosure. As the trial court determined in its March 1998 order, \u201cIt is uncontroverted that all record owners and lienholders of record were previously provided adequate notice and opportunity to redeem the property.\u201d See Associated Estates, LLC v. Caldwell, 779 A.2d 939, 942 (D.C.2001); D.C.Code \u00a7 47 \u2014 1303.04(f)(1) (\u201cNotice by registered or certified mail must be sent to the record owner and all other lienholders of record by the District [of Columbia] at least 30 days in advance of the redemption period.\u201d). Moreover, the District government\u2019s assignment of tax liens, including that relating to 423 Massachusetts Avenue, was recorded on November 20, 1996, and thus was a public document, readily available for inspection. In addition, Kevin Sills disclaimed interest in the Massachusetts Avenue properties in 1997.\nDespite this disclaimer in 1997 of interest in these properties and the related entry of default judgment in the case concerning 423 Massachusetts Avenue, Sco-ville nevertheless argues (1) that as soon as Kevin Sills discovered his mistake in disclaiming an interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue, \u201che promptly contacted [District TLC] to set about correcting the mistake\u201d and (2) that, at that time, \u201cDistrict TLC had not recorded the tax deed; did not [subsequently] do so in a timely manner; and had no conceptual or legal objection to revesting title to [423 Massachusetts Avenue] in Scoville.\u201d Consequently, Scoville argues that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s converted motion for summary judgment[] should have been denied and the case allowed to go to trial.\u201d In particular, Sco-ville points to what it considers \u201cthe trial court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that equity may never constitute a ground for setting aside a tax deed.\u201d It contends \u201cthat a material factual issue exists as to when Scoville knew or should have known of its mistake, whether Scoville was thus otherwise time-barred and whether Scoville was entitled to the trial court\u2019s use of its equitable powers to set aside the tax deed.\u201d Authorities are not in agreement as to whether equity will permit the reformation of a deed because of a mutual mistake of fact. See Board of Comm\u2019rs v. Timroth, 87 P.3d 102 (Colo.2004); Buk Lhu v. Dignoti, 431 Mass. 292, 727 N.E.2d 73 (2000); Goldberg v. Frick Elec. Co., 363 Md. 683, 770 A.2d 182 (2001); Chicago, St. Paul, Min. & Omaha Ry. Co. v. Washburn Land Co., 165 Wis. 125, 161 N.W. 358 (1917).\nHowever, we need not resolve the issues as to whether equity will permit the reformation of a deed because of a mutual mistake of fact, or whether Scoville filed its lawsuit against District TLC and the other appellees within the 90-day window mandated by D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1303.04(f)(2) and (4), or whether there is an applicable exception to the 90-day requirement. This is so because there is another reason why summary judgment was properly granted: the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion. \u201c \u2018Under the doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata, when a valid final judgment has been entered on the merits, the parties or those in privity with them are barred, in a subsequent proceeding, from relitigating the same claim that might have been raised in the first proceeding.\u2019 \u201d Newell v. District of Columbia, 741 A.2d 28, 36 (D.C.1999) (quoting Washington Med. Ctr. v. Holle, 578 A.2d 1269, 1280-81 (D.C.1990)) (other citation omitted). The trial court\u2019s ruling in District TLC\u2019s 1997 lawsuit against Sco-ville, concluding that as to 423 Massachusetts Avenue, Scoville was \u201cbarred and foreclosed of and from all equity and right of redemption in and to the [pjroperty,\u201d is barred by res judicata for purposes of the instant litigation. Seoville\u2019s lawsuit against District TLC involves the same parties, District TLC and Scoville; the same property; and the same disclaimer of interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue as in the 1997 lawsuit brought by District TLC against Scoville. Consequently, it is barred by claim preclusion or res judicata. See Smith v. Jenkins, 562 A.2d 610, 613 (D.C.1989). Scoville could have raised its allegation of \u201cmistaken disclaimer\u201d in the 1997 litigation, but did not do so, and thus it is barred from doing so now. See id., (quoting Raspar Wire Works, Inc. v. Leco Eng\u2019g and Mach., Inc., 575 F.2d 530, 535 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201c[T]he effect of a judgment extends to the litigation of all issues relevant to the same cause of action between the same parties, whether or not raised at trial\u201d)) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nScoville\u2019s final contention concerns an alleged oral agreement between it and District TLC \u201cto settle the underlying litigation\u201d relating to 423 Massachusetts Avenue. This agreement reportedly set up \u201ca procedure through which [District TLC\u2019s servicing agent, Breen Capital Corporation] would solicit bids for the 423[p]roper-ty from the public and then allow Scoville to match the highest bid received as part of this process.\u201d Scoville terms the agreement \u201ca right to match agreement.\u201d Regardless of the appellation, the oral agreement in essence would be more than a simple settlement contract. Rather, it would be described properly as an oral contract for the redemption of an interest in land by Scoville. The redemption process would require Scoville to pay District TLC $475,000 and in turn District TLC would transfer title to 423 Massachusetts Avenue to Scoville. Moreover, with the redemption Scoville would be able to convey its interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue to Urban Opportunity Fund, LLC with whom Scoville had signed a contract on January 23, 2001, for the sale of 423 Massachusetts Avenue, or possibly could execute a contract of sale with some other purchaser. As such, the oral agreement clearly would fall within the District\u2019s Statute of Frauds which applies to \u201ca contract or sale of real estate, of any interest in or concerning it .... \u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28-3502 (2001); see also Griese-Traylor Corp. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, 572 F.2d 1039, 1044 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cAn agreement to allow redemp-tions after the statutory period has expired is an agreement to convey an interest in land and is within the provisions of the statute of fraud.\u201d) (quoting Thompson v. Suttle, 244 Ala. 687, 15 So.2d 590, 592 (1943)).\nGiven these legal principles, Seoville\u2019s argument that a material issue of fact relating to an alleged oral right to match agreement precluded summary judgment is unpersuasive. The trial court assumed that there may have been an oral right to match agreement concerning Scoville\u2019s purchase of the property for $475,000, but the court correctly concluded that even if such an oral agreement did exist, it could not be enforced under the Statute of Frauds, without some evidence of a written agreement, or partial or complete performance under the alleged oral contract. See D.C.Code \u00a7 28-3502 (2001) (\u201cAn action may not be brought ... upon a contract or sale of real estate ... unless the agreement upon which the action is brought, ... is in writing .... \u201d); see also Railan v. Katyal, 766 A.2d 998 (D.C.2001). Here, the alleged agreement was not in writing and, unlike the situation in Brown v. Brown, 343 A.2d 59 (D.C.1975), on which Scoville relies, there is no evidence of partial or complete performance under the alleged right to match agreement in this matter. And, given the posture of this case and the absence of any enforceable settlement agreement, neither Antera v. Robinson, 136 U.S.App. D.C. 216, 419 F.2d 1197 (1969), nor Kann v. King, 25 App. D.C. 182 (1905), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 204 U.S. 43, 27 S.Ct. 213, 51 L.Ed. 360 (1907), is helpful to Scoville.\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nSo ordered.\n. Because there was an outstanding water and sewer bill relating to 421 Massachusetts Avenue, District TLC also sued the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority and the District of Columbia government in the lawsuit pertaining to that property. At the time of the lawsuits filed by District TLC, Scoville owed $30,318.04 in taxes on the 421 Massachusetts Avenue property, and $131,615.56 on the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property. The counts and the request for relief were identical in both complaints.\n. Seoville argues in its reply brief that the only new exhibit attached to its opposition to District TLC\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was counsel\u2019s April 27, 2001 letter to District TLC seeking to redeem the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property; and therefore, \"[a] legitimate question ... exists as to whether or not Seoville indeed relied upon materials \u2018outside of the pleadings,\u2019 Based on the record before us, Seoville did not raise this argument in the trial court; nor did it seek any post-judgment reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling. In any event, in light of the explicit and mandatory language of Rule 12(c) and the obvious reliance by both parties upon documents and matters outside the pleadings, Seoville cannot prevail on its argument.\n. Scoville's contrary argument that its suit to set aside the deed and the 1988 lawsuit to quiet title were different causes of action with \"differing factual nuclei\u201d rests ultimately on the claim that through no lack of diligence on its part, its 1997 disclaimer of interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue was mistaken, and that eventual discovery of this mistake relieved it of the consequences of the 1998 judgment. See Short v. District of Columbia Dep't of Employment Servs., 723 A.2d 845, 849 (D.C.1998) (\"[R]es judicata does not apply to a situation where the basis for a second claim could not have been discovered with due diligence.\u201d). Yet, prior to the termination of the tax foreclosure action relating to 423 Massachusetts Avenue, Scoville determined that it had an interest in 421 Massachusetts Avenue, which is adjacent to 423 Massachusetts Avenue and hence should have been alerted to the possibility of a similar interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue. In addition, the extensive property action in this area of the city should have led Scoville to inquire about 423 Massachusetts Avenue. See Berkow v. Hayes Nat. Training School, 841 A.2d 776, 781 (D.C.2004). Thus, we cannot say that Scoville was faced with newly discovered facts that could not have been discovered with due diligence.\n. Unlike Schlumpf v. Shofner, 210 Ark. 452, 196 S.W.2d 747 (1946), the alleged oral contract here is not one merely for the extension of the time of redemption. Id. at 749 (\" 'A verbal agreement to extend the time for redemption ... is valid and not affected by the statute of frauds.' \") (quoting Ogden v. Stevens, 241 Ill. 556, 89 N.E. 741, 743 (1909)).",
