        "text": "GLICKMAN, Associate Judge:\nThe issue in this appeal is whether \u201cattempted threats\u201d is a crime in the District of Columbia. We hold that it is.\nI.\nThe crime charged in this case occurred following a preliminary hearing in Superi- or Court in which appellant Jerome Evans was the defendant. As Evans walked from the courtroom, two police officers sitting in the gallery overheard him speak to an unidentified person behind them. The officers heard Evans say that he was going to kill the witness, another police officer, who had just testified against him. The officers reported what they heard, and Evans was charged with the misdemeanor of making a threat to do bodily harm in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-507 (1996). Prior to trial, the government reduced the charge against Evans to one of attempted threats in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-103 and 22-507. The trial court found Evans guilty of that offense in a bench trial.\nEvans\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. According to Evans, attempted threats cannot be a crime because \u201cit is physiologically impossible to attempt to orally threaten another.\u201d Evans reasons that until the threat is uttered, there is no crime at all, since the law does not punish mere thoughts, even malevolent ones; and that as soon as the threat is uttered, the crime of threats is not merely attempted, but completed. In other words, Evans argues that the evidence in any prosecution for attempted threats will establish either the consummated offense of threats or no offense at all. Evans further asserts that the government improperly charged him with an attempt solely in order to deprive him of a right to a jury trial.\nFor the reasons that follow, we reject Evans\u2019s arguments.\nII.\nThe general attempts statute under which Evans was prosecuted, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-103 (1996), originated as a provision in the criminal code that Congress enacted for the District in 1901. See Act of March 3, 1901, ch. 854, \u00a7 906, 31 Stat. 1321, 1337. In its current codification, the statute provides in pertinent part that \u201c[wjhoever shall attempt to commit any crime, which attempt is not otherwise made punishable by chapter 19 of [the 1901 Act], shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or both.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 22-103.\nOn its face, the general prohibition of attempts in D.C.Code \u00a7 22-103 does apply to attempts to threaten bodily harm, because the attempt to commit that crime was not \u201cotherwise made punishable\u201d by Chapter 19 (the criminal code chapter) of the 1901 Act. The completed crime of threats itself was not proscribed in the criminal code of 1901, nor was it a crime at common law in this jurisdiction. See Postell v. United States, 282 A.2d 551, 553 (D.C.1971). Threats was made a crime in the District in 1912, when Congress enacted what later became D.C.Code \u00a7 22-507. See Act effective July 16, 1912, ch. 235, \u00a7 2, 37 Stat. 193. We think it immaterial that threats was not a crime when the general attempts statute became law in 1901. The attempts statute refers expansively to attempts to commit \u201cany crime,\u201d and we can find no warrant for construing that language narrowly so as to exclude new crimes created after 1901 from its scope. On the contrary, without even commenting on the matter, we have long understood the attempts statute to apply to subsequently created offenses. See Greenwood v. United States, 225 A.2d 878, 880 (D.C.1967) (applying attempts statute to unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, an offense enacted in 1913).\nFurthermore, the government was permitted to charge Evans with attempted threats even though it could prove the completed offense. To prove an attempt, the government is not required to prove more than \u201can overt act done with the intent to commit a crime, ... which, except for some interference, would have resulted in the commission of the crime.\u201d Wormsley v. United States, 526 A.2d 1373, 1375 (D.C.1987). But failure is not an essential element of criminal attempt. \u201cEvery completed criminal offense necessarily includes an attempt to commit that offense.\u201d Ray v. United States, 575 A.2d 1196, 1199 (D.C.1990). Our decisions have repeatedly held that \u201ca person charged with an attempt to commit a crime may be convicted even though the evidence shows a completed offense, not merely an attempt.\u201d Id.; accord, United States v. Fleming, 215 A.2d 839, 841-42 (D.C.1966). See also Criminal JURY Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 4.04 (4th ed.1993).\nWe do not agree with Evans that it is impossible \u2014 for physiological or any other reasons \u2014 to attempt an oral threat without simultaneously consummating the offense. This court has previously rejected Evans\u2019s claim that \u201cmerely uttering a threat completes the crime.\u201d United States v. Baish, 460 A.2d 38, 42 n. 5 (D.C.1983). \u201cThe essential elements of the offense of threats to do bodily harm are: that the defendant uttered words to another person; that the words were of such a nature as to convey fear of serious bodily harm or injury to the ordinary hearer; that the defendant intended to utter the words which constituted the threat.\u201d Campbell v. United States, 450 A.2d 428, 431 n. 5 (D.C.1982). Thus, \u201can individual must do more than utter a threat; the evidence must show that the threatening message was conveyed to someone \u2014 either to the object of the threat or to a third party.\u201d Baish, 460 A.2d at 42. \u201cAn uncommunicated threat, by definition, cannot threaten.\u201d Id. It follows that if a threat fortuitously goes unheard, the person who utters it is guilty of an attempt, not the completed offense. Attempted but unconsummated oral threats are easy to conceive \u2014 as where, for instance, a threat is garbled and not understood, or is whispered too softly to be heard, or is spoken into a telephone answering device that malfunctions and fails to record the utterance, or is recorded but erased before anyone listens to it. As a practical matter, such unconsummated threats may be unprovable, for lack of available evidence; but there is no doubt that they can be perpetrated. Evans was not, therefore, convicted of a non-existent crime.\nSince \u201cattempted threats\u201d is a valid statutory offense, the United States Attorney had discretion to charge it. \u201cIf the facts show a violation of two or more statutes, an election may be made to prosecute under either.\u201d United States v. Young, 376 A.2d 809, 812 (D.C.1977).\nEvans complains, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s election in this case deprived him of a statutory right to a trial by jury, even though the penalties for misdemeanor threats and attempted threats are virtually identical. Under D.C.Code \u00a7 16 \u2014 705(b) (2001), a defendant is entitled to a jury trial on all offenses (except contempt of court) that are punishable by imprisonment for more than 180 days. The maximum prison sentence for attempted threats is just 180 days. See D.C.Code \u00a7 22-103. The maximum prison sentence for the completed offense of misdemeanor threats, on the other hand, is six months, which is deemed to be slightly more than 180 days. See D.C.Code \u00a7 22-507; Turner v. Bayly, 673 A.2d 596, 597 (D.C.1996). Thus, had Evans been prosecuted for threats instead of attempted threats, he would have enjoyed a right to be tried by a jury. But that does not mean that Evans\u2019s rights were violated. The existence of a right to a jury trial depends on the maximum punishment for the offense that is charged, not on the maximum punishment for an offense that could be charged but is not. Ultimately, Evans was charged with attempted threats. Since the maximum punishment for that offense fell below the statutory threshold, Evans was not denied any statutory right to a jury trial, for he simply had no such right.\nIII.\nTo sum up, we hold that attempted threats is a valid statutory offense under the laws of the District of Columbia. The government did not violate Evans\u2019s rights in charging him with that offense. The evidence of his guilt was sufficient, and we affirm his conviction.\nSo ordered.\n. Evans also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him, arguing that no one actually saw who uttered the threat. This challenge does not merit extended discussion. Two police officers testified that they heard and saw Evans make the threat as he walked past them. We defer to the trial judge\u2019s decision to credit their testimony. See, e.g., In re R.H.M., 630 A.2d 705, 707 (D.C.1993).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-103 was recently recodified, without change, as D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1803 (2001).\n. Chapter 19 of the 1901 Act did contain provisions that dealt specifically with attempts to commit certain other crimes. See, e.g., ch. 854, \u00a7 811, 31 Stat. 1322 (attempted robbery).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-507 has been recodified as D.C.Code \u00a7 22-407 (2001).",
