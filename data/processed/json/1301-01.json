        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nCorbin pled guilty to possession of phen-cyclidine (PCP) and cannabis (marijuana). He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms on each count despite his argument that concurrent sentences were required because the \u201ccounts arose from one course of conduct.\u201d He contends that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences. We affirm.\nAppellant was arrested on an unrelated charge. When he was searched, an envelope was found in his possession containing three tinfoils of marijuana and some loose marijuana. The marijuana in the tinfoils was \u201claced\u201d with PCP. On this appeal, Corbin contends that the Uniform Controlled Substance Act (UCSA), D.C. Code \u00a7 33-541(c) (1983 Supp.) makes the possession of marijuana \u201claced\u201d with PCP one offense for sentencing purposes. He refers us specifically to \u00a7 33-516(4) which interdicts possession of \u201cany material, compound, mixture or preparation which contains any quantity\u201d of certain substances. We reject this contention. The plain language of the statute, read as a whole, as well as the legislative history, makes clear that the legislature intended to and did make the possession of each prohibited substance a separate offense. The language of \u00a7 33-516(4) makes the admixture of a non-prohibited substance with a prohibited substance a criminal offense. See generally Carpenter v. United States, 475 A.2d 369 (D.C.1984); Lawrence v. United States, 473 A.2d 373 (D.C.1984). See also United States v. Davis, 656 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 930, 102 S.Ct. 1979, 72 L.Ed.2d 446 (1982); State v. Adams, 364 A.2d 1237 (Del.Super.Ct.1976); State v. Williams, 542 S.W.2d 3 (Mo.App.1976); State v. Collier, 567 S.W.2d 165 (Tenn.Sup.Ct.1978).\nAffirmed.\n. Although Corbin only attacks the consecutive sentences, if his contentions were valid, he would be entitled to have one count of his conviction vacated since he would have committed only one offense.",
