        "text": "HOLLAND, Justice.\nOn December 1, 1998, the defendant-appellant, Gordon L. Manis, was involved in a fatal motor vehicle collision at the intersection of Routes 13 and 273. Manis was arrested at the scene. On January 19, 1999, Manis was indicted by a Superior Court Grand Jury and charged with: Murder in the Second Degree; Driving a Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drugs; Failure to have Required Insurance; and Driving While License is Suspended.\nOn June 7,1999, the parties entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 11(e)(1)(C). This subsection permits the parties to \u201cagree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case,\u201d subject to approval by the Superior Court. The parties\u2019 plea agreement provided that Manis would plead guilty to Manslaughter and Driving Under the Influence and that a nolle pro-sequi would be entered as to all the remaining charges. The plea agreement further provided for a sentence of \u201c10 years Level V, suspended after 30 months for probation.\u201d The parties also agreed to a presentence investigation for the purpose of determining restitution.\nOn October 7,1999, the parties appeared for the plea hearing in Superior Court. The plea agreement was presented to a Judge of the Superior Court. The Superi- or Court Judge who presided at the October 7, 1999 guilty plea colloquy stated that \u201cthe Court will exercise its discretion and defer to the parties\u2019 agreement with respect to sentence. That will mean two and a half years in prison.\u201d The Superior Court Judge then announced his acceptance of the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement, entered judgments of guilt, and ordered a presentence investigation.\nOn January 7, 2000, Manis appeared for sentencing before a different Judge of the Superior Court. According to Manis, the second Judge sentenced him to a punishment in excess of what the parties had agreed to pursuant to the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement. On March 10, 2000, Manis filed a motion requesting the second Superior Court Judge to correct Manis\u2019 sentence to reflect the sentence provided for in the plea agreement.\nOn March 28, 2000, the Superior Court denied Manis\u2019 motion to have his sentenced corrected and stated \u201cassuming without deciding that [Manis\u2019] sentence exceeds the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement, the Superior Court is not bound by Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreements.\u201d Manis contends that \u201cgiven the parties\u2019 Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement, the Superior Court was bound to impose a sentence no greater than that provided for in the plea agreement once the Superior Court had accepted same.\u201d In this appeal, the State acknowledges that \u201cany statements by the sentencing judge in the post-sentencing proceedings that the trial court is not bound by the provisions of Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 11(e)(1)(C) are legally incorrect.\u201d\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 11(e)(2) provides, in part: \u201cIf the agreement is of the type specified in subdivision (e)(1)(C), the court may accept or reject the agreement, or may defer its decision as to the acceptance or rejection until there has been an opportunity to consider the pre-sentence report.\u201d In Manis\u2019 case, the first Superior Court Judge accepted the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement immediately. Absent fraud on the court, such a plea agreement is binding on the Superior Court once it is accepted by the Superior Court.\nThis matter is remanded to the Superior Court to ascertain whether Manis was sentenced to punishment in excess of the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) Plea Agreement and, if so, for the imposition of a sentence no greater than that provided for in the Plea Agreement. The Superior Court shall file a report with this Court within sixty days. Jurisdiction is retained.\n.According to Manis, \"the Superior Court sentence ultimately included punishment beyond that provided for in the sentencing agreement: specifically, 30 months at Level 5, to be followed by 6 months at Supervision Level 4, to be followed by 1 years of Home Confinement.\u201d Additionally, Manis submits that his driving privileges were \"revoked for 15 years.\u201d\n. Super. Ct.Crim. R. 11(e)(3).\n. Conversely, this Court has held that the Superior Court is not bound by plea agreements it has not accepted. Somerville v. State, Del.Supr., 703 A.2d 629, 633 (1997). Superior Court Rule 11(e)(1)(C) is based upon a corresponding provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Federal rule was recently amended to clarify that while the court retains absolute discretion whether to accept a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) Plea Agreement, \"such a plea agreement is binding on the court once it is accepted by the court.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C) advisory committee's note.\n. Supr. Ct. R. 19(c).",
