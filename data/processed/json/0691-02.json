        "text": "GLICKMAN, Associate Judge:\nA jury convicted appellant Toussell Van Kuhn of two counts of armed robbery and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Kuhn\u2019s co-defendant, appellant Darnell Smith, was convicted of one count of armed robbery. In their direct appeals, each appellant contends that the trial court should have severed their trials or granted them separate new trials because their defenses were irreconcilable. The direct appeals have been consolidated with two collateral appeals: (1) that of Smith from the denial of his motion to set aside his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) that of Kuhn from the denial of his post-trial motion to unseal the transcript of an ex parte bench conference in which his co-defendant Smith discussed his unhappiness with his trial counsel\u2019s direction of his defense.\nThe foremost issue presented in these consolidated appeals is whether Smith\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he chose, over Smith\u2019s objection, to argue a theory of defense different from that to which Smith testified. In agreement with the trial court, we conclude that Smith\u2019s counsel was not ineffective, for after he consulted with his client, the choice of defense strategy was committed to counsel\u2019s professional judgment even if Smith did not consent to it, and the strategy he pursued in his closing argument was an objectively reasonable and permissible one.\nAs we also conclude that appellants\u2019 defenses were not irreconcilable, and that Kuhn has not shown a bona fide need for the transcript he sought, we affirm both appellants\u2019 convictions.\nI.\nAccording to the government\u2019s evidence at trial, Elton Blaize and Tansy Philbert, a young couple who had come to the District of Columbia from the Virgin Islands to participate in the Job Corps, were robbed on the street in broad daylight while they were visiting a fellow Job Corps student named Cynthia Knott. The robbery occurred while Knott had left Blaize and Philbert alone momentarily and gone across the street in order to speak with one of her neighbors. Appellant Kuhn appeared, grabbed Blaize from behind, held a gun to his temple, and pulled him back into an alley. After obtaining $150 in cash from Blaize\u2019s wallet, Kuhn ordered Philbert to hand over her money, too. At this point, Blaize and Philbert testified, appellant Smith ran up to Philbert and seconded Kuhn\u2019s demand for her money. Philbert also relinquished $150 to the robbers.\nMeanwhile, across the street, Knott became aware of her friends\u2019 plight. Knott testified at trial that she saw Kuhn rob Blaize at gunpoint. It appeared to Knott that Kuhn was accompanied by a man she knew named Isaac Mitchell. Knott also observed Smith, but in contrast to her friends\u2019 account, she testified that Smith remained about fifteen feet away from Kuhn and did not approach Blaize or Phil-bert. \u201cShocked\u201d by what was occurring, Knott started across the street, yelling that Blaize and Philbert were her friends. She caught up with them after the robbery as they were running away, and the trio called the police.\nAfter the police arrived, Knott directed them to where she thought the robbers had fled. Before long, they spotted Kuhn, Smith and Mitchell, who were standing together on the street. The three men were caught and arrested after a brief chase. The police recovered a total of $236 from their possession and a small packet of marijuana from Smith. No gun was found.\nAppellants presented a different version of events. They admitted encountering Blaize and Philbert, but as forecast in their attorneys\u2019 opening statements, appellants denied that the encounter resulted in robbery. Rather, Smith and Kuhn each testified, they happened to be walking down the street (accompanied by Mitchell) when Blaize, whom they did not know, appeared and signaled to Kuhn that he wanted to buy some marijuana. Smith offered to sell Blaize a dime bag that he happened to have hidden in his sock, but Blaize wanted a full ounce. Kuhn said that he could obtain an ounce of marijuana from a dealer he knew, and Blaize allegedly gave Kuhn $120 to buy it and bring it back to him. Kuhn, Smith and Mitchell left to carry out this commercial errand. However, appellants testified, before they were able to find the dealer, they were stopped by the police.\nAppellants\u2019 theory apparently was that Blaize, Philbert and Knott, believing that appellants had absconded, concocted the story of a robbery in order to have them arrested so that Blaize could recover the money he naively had entrusted to Kuhn. In his closing argument, however, Smith\u2019s counsel, Ronald Horton, did not argue this \u201cdrug deal gone bad\u201d theory. Although Horton began by asking the jury to credit his client\u2019s testimony, he chose not to dwell on the particulars of what Smith had said:\nMr. Darnell Smith took the witness stand, I submit to you, and he credibly told you what happened that night. He was not involved in a robbery, any kind of an armed robbery. He didn\u2019t come into the possession of any money by the two complainants. I ask you to credit his testimony. I will not talk any more about his testimony, because the burden is on the government. And we want to focus on the government\u2019s evidence, and the reasons why there are problems, reasons to doubt Mr. Smith\u2019s guilt.\nAfter stressing that Smith did not participate in robbing Blaize (\u201cThe government\u2019s theory is that that was done by the co-defendant Mr. Kuhn\u201d), Horton turned to \u201cthe more difficult question, ... the alleged armed robbery of Ms. Tansy Phil-bert.\u201d That charge rested on the inculpa-tory testimony of Blaize and Philbert. Citing inconsistencies in their statements and other doubt-engendering discrepancies in the government\u2019s case, Horton emphasized, \u201cmost importantly,\u201d the \u201cmore credible\u201d exoneration of his client by \u201cthe government\u2019s star witness,\u201d Cynthia Knott:\nBut most importantly, the government\u2019s star witness, and I agree entirely with the characterization of her by [the prosecutor], that she is a strong-willed woman, that she wasn\u2019t taking nothing out there and that she was going to put a stop to whatever the heck was happening out there and she went over and tried to put a stop to it and she saw exactly what was going on.\nAnd what she saw was money in the hand of Mr. Blaize, and she saw that money being taken out of his hand by Mr. Kuhn. And when that\u2019s going on, Mr. Smith is on the sidewalk. He is not robbing anybody. He is not taking money from anybody. And if you combine that clear unmistakable testimony with what Mr. Blaize says, Mr. Blaize says that the money was taken out of his hand one time first.\nAfter that, according to him, and according to Ms. Philbert, when Ms. Philbert comes over and Mr. Smith comes over, the alleged robbery happens with Mr. Smith.\nIf you accept the testimony of Ms. Cynthia Knott as to what she saw, what she tried to stop, then you cannot possibly accept beyond a reasonable doubt the testimony of Tansy Philbert or Elton Blaize in any version that they have given.\nShe comes over. She sees the robbery. She basically breaks up the robbery. Stop that \u2014 you know, whatever she says, and the crowd disperses and the two complainants run away.\nIf her version is credible, and I submit it is more credible than either of the other government witnesses \u2014 she doesn\u2019t tell different stories at different times like they do, and she is not the one who is immediately put in fear. She is the one who is clear headed enough to see what\u2019s going on and wants to put a stop to it. If you accept her testimony, you must acquit Darnell Smith.\nIn conclusion, Horton stated, while he declined to suggest that the complainants were \u201cnecessarily lying,\u201d Smith deserved to be acquitted because there existed a reasonable doubt as to his guilt:\nThere are reasons to question, and I am not suggesting that they [Blaize and Philbert] are necessarily lying. That\u2019s not what your job is to do, [] to determine whether they are necessarily lying. It is to analyze the evidence with only one goal in mind, is there a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Mr. Smith. They [Blaize and Philbert] could be wrong. It was a shocking event. It adds up, I submit, to a reasonable doubt.\nAfter hearing Horton\u2019s closing argument, Kuhn\u2019s counsel moved for severance and a mistrial, arguing that Horton\u2019s \u201cstrong, enthusiastic, empathetic endorsement of Cynthia Knott\u201d had effectively \u201cnegated\u201d the testimony given by both her client and Smith. The trial judge denied the motion, noting that Horton\u2019s argument was \u201cmore in the nature of raising questions about credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses and who could be relied upon,\u201d rather than \u201ctaking a position directly opposite from his client.\u201d Surprisingly, Horton himself then moved for a mistrial \u201cto protect [his client\u2019s] interest,\u201d explaining that \u201c[b]ecause of my closing argument, I could not wholeheartedly adopt the version of events testified to by my client.\u201d The trial court denied this motion, too, telling Horton that he had done \u201can excellent job of wending [his] way up through shoals of ethical issues and [Smith\u2019s] interests.\u201d\nSmith echoed Kuhn\u2019s condemnation of his counsel\u2019s closing argument in his subsequent \u00a7 23-110 motion. According to Smith, Horton fatally undermined his credibility and \u201cblotted out\u201d his defense by giving an argument that was \u201ctotally contrary\u201d to his and Kuhn\u2019s testimony.\nIn an affidavit submitted with the government\u2019s opposition to Smith\u2019s motion, Horton explained the genesis of his closing argument. To begin with, Horton stated, his client\u2019s version of events was implausible and, indeed, \u201crife with problems\u201d:\nMr. Smith\u2019s proposed theory would require the jury to believe that the complainants would give more than one hundred dollars to a complete stranger and permit him to walk away with the money with no way to account for who the recipient of the money was or where he was going. It would require the jury to believe that at least three persons, the complainants and an eyewitness, Cynthia Knott, totally fabricated the existence of a gun in the co-defendant\u2019s possession. It would require the jury to believe that the complainants were outright\nlying about their denials of being on the scene of the incident to purchase marijuana. The inherent difficulties with the proposed line of defense were heightened when I had the chance to briefly interview the complainants face-to-face. Both complainants came across as credible, sincere, well-spoken and intelligent. They had no history of drug use or abuse. In my professional opinion they were not the kind of persons whom the jury would be apt to disbelieve.\nHorton advised Smith that his proposed line of defense \u201cwould in all likelihood result in convictions of extremely serious charges.\u201d At trial, however, the opportunity arose to pursue a more promising defense strategy:\nAt the outset of trial, Jencks material was provided to me. The documents contained information which in my opinion held the promise of a defense strategy that could be successful. The police statement of complainant Tansy Philbert indicated that the co-defendant alone completed the robbery of herself and the other complainant. The grand jury testimony of eyewitness Cynthia Knott could be reasonably construed as indicating that Mr. Smith did not participate in any robbery. Upon receiving that information I determined that the strategy most likely to result in a verdict beneficial to my client\u2019s interests was to propound a theory of defense and strategy of cross-examination that attempted to raise a reasonable doubt as to my client\u2019s involvement in any criminal activity and to distance my client from the conduct engaged in by the co-defendant.\nHorton discussed his thinking with Smith, who \u201cdid not agree with my proposed line of defense.\u201d Nonetheless, Horton stated,\nI decided to proceed in the way that I thought would be in the best interest of my client, focusing on the inconsistencies in the testimony of the government witnesses and pointing out those portions of the evidence that suggested my client\u2019s non-involvement in the offenses. I believed it would be more effective to use the startling and distressing nature of the event to raise a doubt about the reliability of the witnesses than to outright accuse them of blatant fabrication. ... My closing argument was intended to emphasize and focus the jury on the weaknesses in the government\u2019s proof of Mr. Smith\u2019s involvement in the charged offenses. I did not intend to denigrate Mr. Smith\u2019s testimony.\nThe trial court directed Smith to submit a statement \u201csetting out what, if any, factual assertions in Mr. Horton\u2019s affidavit are disputed.\u201d In response, Smith stated that he \u201cis not in a position to dispute the averments of attorney Horton with regard to what attorney Horton \u2018believed,\u2019 as to what attorney Horton \u2018felt,\u2019 or as to what became \u2018apparent\u2019 to attorney Horton.\u201d\nPerceiving no material issues of fact necessitating an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied Smith\u2019s ineffectiveness claims on the basis of the existing record. To begin with, the court noted, while Horton primarily emphasized the weaknesses of the government\u2019s proof and the exculpatory implications of Knott\u2019s testimony rather than his client\u2019s account, he did not disavow Smith\u2019s testimony; to the contrary, he explicitly asked the jury to credit it. More importantly, the court stated, Horton was not obliged to advocate the theory of defense that Smith favored: \u201c[b]y the time of closing, with all of the evidence in, it was counsel, not his client, who had the authority and responsibility for making the strategic decisions with respect to how to structure the closing argument.\u201d Horton \u201chad a choice. He could rely entirely on the \u2018drug deal gone bad\u2019, defense, with which his client was so enamored, or, as he decided to do, he could argue in the alternative \u2014 \u2018believe the defendant Smith, but if you don\u2019t, there is still reasonable doubt with respect to Smith\u2019s guilt.\u2019 \u201d Because that decision was an objectively reasonable one, the court concluded, it did not constitute ineffective assistance.\nII.\nTo succeed on a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). This case turns on the first requirement. Deficient performance means \u201cthat counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The test is an objective one: \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d Id. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201c[I]n any given case,\u201d there may be a \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 and trial counsel therefore \u201cmust be given sufficient latitude to make tactical decisions and strategic judgments which involve the exercise of professional abilities.\u201d Woodard v. United States, 738 A.2d 254, 257 (D.C.1999). \u201c[Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Accordingly, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (citation omitted). Thus, as we more than once have said, \u201c[mjere errors of judgment and tactical mistakes do not constitute deficiency, nor do mere disagreements with trial counsel\u2019s choices.\u201d Jenkins v. United States, 870 A.2d 27, 34 (D.C.2005) (citation omitted); see, e.g., Leftridge v. United States, 780 A.2d 266, 272 (D.C.2001).\nIn reviewing the denial of Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, which have ample support in the record. Jenkins, 870 A.2d at 33-34. Although the trial court made its findings without conducting an evidentiary hearing, we are satisfied that a hearing was not necessary because, as the court took care to ascertain, the material facts were undisputed and could be determined without augmentation of the existing record. See Ginyard v. United States, 816 A.2d 21, 37-38 (D.C.2003).\nOur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal determination is, of course, de novo. Smith asks us to hold that the trial court erred because Horton, as his defense counsel, was obligated to follow his directions to argue the \u201cdrug deal gone bad\u201d defense to which he had testified. By not doing so, Smith contends, Horton \u201cblotted out\u201d his chosen defense and prevented him from effectively presenting that defense to the jury. Moreover, Smith adds, Horton damaged his credibility with the jury by implicitly conveying the impression that even his attorney disbelieved him. Indeed, Smith asserts, Horton blatantly contradicted his testimony by affirming Knott\u2019s credibility and by essentially conceding the robberies and the guilt of his co-defendant Kuhn. These charges raise some serious questions, but they do not persuade us that the performance of Smith\u2019s trial counsel was deficient under the circumstances presented. Rather, we agree with the trial court that Horton adopted and carried out an objectively reasonable and permissible strategy for his closing argument. He did not render ineffective assistance.\nIn the first place, to put Smith\u2019s claims in perspective, Horton did not prevent the jury from hearing Smith\u2019s chosen defense and ascribing whatever weight it saw fit to his testimony. Horton called Smith to the witness stand. Through direct examination of his client, without undermining Smith in any way, Horton fully elicited his testimony that there was no robbery. Nor did Horton disavow Smith\u2019s \u201cdrug deal gone bad\u201d defense in his closing argument; rather, Horton expressly asked the jury to believe his client (\u201cHe credibly told you what happened that night.... I ask you to credit his testimony.\u201d).\nFurthermore, it did not conflict with Smith\u2019s testimony and his affirmative defense for Horton to emphasize the government\u2019s burden of proof, the unreliability of Blaize and Philbert and, in particular, Knott\u2019s testimony that she did not see Smith participate in the robbery. Smith\u2019s assertion that Horton asked the jury to credit Knott\u2019s. testimony rather than his own is not accurate. Horton was more skillful than that. He couched his argument in conditional terms. \u201cIf you accept the testimony of Ms. Cynthia Knott ...,\u201d he argued, \u201cthen you cannot possibly accept beyond a reasonable doubt the testimony of Tansy Philbei\u2019t or Elton Blaize in any version that they have given.... If [Knott\u2019s] version is credible, and I submit it is more credible than either of the other government witnesses.... If you accept her testimony, you must acquit Darnell Smith.\u201d (Emphases added.)\nIt is true, of course, that Horton did not dwell on his client\u2019s testimony. He said very little in favor of Smith\u2019s credibility and did not argue that the complainants had fabricated the armed robbery charge. But in Horton\u2019s considered professional judgment, the jury was unlikely to accept Smith\u2019s problematic account of a \u201cdrug deal gone bad\u201d or believe that Blaize, Phil-bert and Knott were three bald-faced liars. In Horton\u2019s judgment, moreover, Knott\u2019s testimony provided the evidentiary basis for a more believable argument. Horton\u2019s assessments were in line with the evidence, and they constituted exactly the kinds of \u201ctactical decisions and strategic judgments which involve the exercise of professional abilities,\u201d Woodard, 738 A.2d at 257, that defense counsel is supposed to make. As Horton\u2019s closing argument thus was the product of sensible \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options,\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, we cannot deem it unreasonable, and we are precluded from second-guessing it.\nThe nub of Smith\u2019s complaint, however, is not so much that Horton\u2019s strategy in closing argument was objectively unreasonable, but rather that Horton refused to follow his directions to pursue a different strategy. Smith disagreed with Horton and wanted him to argue the \u201cdrug deal gone bad\u201d defense whether Horton liked it or not. Smith claims that as he was the client, the choice of defense strategy \u2014 including the defense to be advanced and the structure and emphasis of the closing argument \u2014 was his to make. Horton\u2019s performance was deficient, Smith contends, precisely because Horton rejected his decision.\nSmith\u2019s position is not correct. Horton had a duty, which he fulfilled, to consult with Smith about his defense strategy. As stated in Rule 1.2(a) of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct, \u201cA lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, ... and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.\u201d See Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (\u201cAn attorney undoubtedly has a duty to consult with the client regarding \u2018important decisions,\u2019 including questions of overarching defense strategy.\u201d) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). But Horton did not have a duty to accede to Smith\u2019s decision on \u201cthe means\u201d or to obtain Smith\u2019s consent to the strategy he ultimately chose to employ. Except for certain specific decisions, the client is not the final arbiter as to the conduct of the defense. \u201cIn a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client\u2019s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial, and whether the client will testify.\u201d District of Columbia Rules on Professional Conduct 1.2(a). With those exceptions, \u201cthe lawyer has \u2014 and must have \u2014 full authority to manage the conduct of the trial,\u201d Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988), and so, after appropriate consultation, \u201cstrategic and tactical decisions are the exclusive province of the defense counsel.\u201d Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 753 n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983) (citing the American Bar Association\u2019s Defense Function Standards); see also Nixon, 543 U.S. at 187, 125 S.Ct. 551 (obligation to consult with the client \u201cdoes not require counsel to obtain the defendant\u2019s consent to every tactical decision\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). So long as \u201ccounsel\u2019s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant\u2019s guilt, satisfies the Strickland standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.\u201d Nixon, 543 U.S. at 192, 125 S.Ct. 551; cf. United States v. Leggett, 317 U.S.App. D.C. 125, 133, 81 F.3d 220, 228 (1996) (holding that counsel\u2019s refusal to present client\u2019s flawed defense \u201cwas a reasonable trial strategy, and does not amount to ineffective representation\u201d). In the present case, therefore, since Horton\u2019s choice of strategy was objectively reasonable, it is immaterial for Sixth Amendment purposes that Smith did not consent to it.\nIII.\nWe address appellants\u2019 remaining arguments summarily. Neither Smith nor Kuhn was entitled to severance on the theory that their defenses were \u201cirreconcilable.\u201d Both defendants testified the same way, that there was an aborted drug deal but not a robbery. Their defenses were compatible. There was no \u201cclear and substantial contradiction\u201d between those defenses, Garris v. United States, 559 A.2d 323, 329 (D.C.1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), merely because Smith\u2019s counsel seized the opportunity presented by Knott\u2019s testimony to argue in the alternative that even if there was a robbery, his client was not involved in it; nor because Kuhn presented a witness who testified that he and Smith were together prior to the robbery. Moreover, since Smith had no grounds to request a severance, his counsel could not be found ineffective for failing to move for it prior to trial. See Carpenter v. United States, 475 A.2d 369, 375 (D.C.1984). Lastly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kuhn\u2019s motion to unseal the transcript of its mid-trial ex parte bench conference with Smith regarding Smith\u2019s disagreements with Horton. Like the trial court, we see no basis for Kuhn\u2019s claim that he somehow might have exploited the presumptively confidential details of this conference to bolster his severance argument on appeal.\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellants\u2019 convictions.\n. The jury also found Smith guilty of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, but the trial court then granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on that charge.\n. Blaize had noticed Mitchell standing behind him when Kuhn had the gun to his head. Although Mitchell later was arrested, he was not charged in connection with the robbery. Mitchell was deceased at the time of the trial.\n. Including, for example, the fact that only $236 was found on appellants, while Blaize and Philbert claimed that $300 was taken from them.\n. Interestingly, in her own closing argument, Kuhn's counsel followed a strategy not so different from Horton\u2019s approach. Although she did dispute that there had been a robbery, she refrained from endorsing her client's drug deal account, preferring (like Horton) to emphasize the deficiencies in the government\u2019s evidence.\n. Smith also argued that his counsel was ineffective in other respects. We address below his claim that Horton should have moved for severance prior to trial; we do not address Smith\u2019s other accusations because he failed to argue them in his brief. See Wagner v. Georgetown Univ. Med. Ctr., 768 A.2d 546, 554 n. 9 (D.C.2001) (\"Issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\u201d) (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)); accord, Bardoff v. United States, 628 A.2d 86, 90 n. 8 (D.C.1993).\n. When one of Kuhn\u2019s defense witnesses testified that Smith and Kuhn were together on the day of the robbery, Smith's counsel moved for a mid-trial severance because \"[t]hat\u2019s irreconcilable with my defense, where I\u2019m trying to get them separate and had no contact before\u201d the encounter with Blaize and Philbert. As previously mentioned, Kuhn moved for severance based on the closing argument of Smith's counsel. The trial court denied both motions.",
