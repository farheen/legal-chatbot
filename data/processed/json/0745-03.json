After hearing arguments of counsel and considering defendant\u2019s brief we are of the opinion that the issue of support is factual and that clearly there is sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact by the trial justice. Further the issue is one of judicial discretion and clearly there was no abuse of discretion by the trial justice. Accordingly, the motion to affirm the judgment below is hereby granted and defendant\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed.",
