The Court considers this to be the appropriate sanction upon the following considerations:\n1. The nature of Respondent\u2019s conduct described in the Opinion.\n2. The Respondent\u2019s lack of contrition or remorse.\n3. The Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate with the Judicial Conduct Board in its investigation and prosecution of this case.\n4. The fact that this is the second time in two years that this Court has found this Respondent has engaged in conduct that required the imposition of discipline. In the first case, this Court imposed the sanction of reprimand. In that case, Judge Le-adbetter dissented and would have imposed a sanction of suspension for \u201cat least\u201d ninety days without pay.\nThis time, the Court concludes that removal is the appropriate sanction.\nSANDLER, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. In re Berkhimer, 828 A.2d 19 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2003).",

I do so because I believe that is a sanction too harsh in the circumstances of this case. While Respondent\u2019s conduct was unquestionably rude, and even nasty, it was not criminal, and there was no implication made that his service to the citizens of his magisterial district was other than competent and conscientious. In my view, suspension for six months without pay would be an appropriate sanction.",
