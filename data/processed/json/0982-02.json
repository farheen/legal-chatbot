The plaintiff appeals a Superior Court judgment entered on a directed verdict for the defendant.\nThe plaintiff was injured in a fall on a step while exiting Marquette Credit Union (defendant) in Woonsocket and alleged, in her complaint, that defendant\u2019s negligent maintenance of the step caused her injury.\nAfter reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and hearing the arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown. The trial justice considered the evidence and concluded that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof. Furthermore, plaintiff presented no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence nor of the proximate cause of her fall. In such a case, a directed verdict is appropriate. Garris v. Gloss, 111 R.I. 453, 458, 303 A.2d 765, 768 (1973).\nConsequently, we deny and dismiss the plaintiffs appeal and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.",
