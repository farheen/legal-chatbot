        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nA jury found appellant guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol (OWI), and operating a motor vehicle without an operator\u2019s permit. The District government concedes that, if appellant\u2019s conviction for DUI is upheld, her conviction for OWI must be vacated on remand as duplicative. We accept the government\u2019s concession. See Santos v. District of Columbia, 940 A.2d 113, 114 (D.C.2007).\nAppellant, for her part, assigns only one error affecting her DUI conviction: he argues that the trial judge erroneously refused to instruct the jury, in keeping with a temporary law in effect at the time of trial (but which later expired), that the small amount of alcohol that a contemporaneous breathalyzer test detected in appellant\u2019s blood created a rebuttable presumption that she was not driving under the influence. We reject this argument because it was not preserved by objection; indeed, in reply to a question by the trial judge, appellant\u2019s counsel agreed that she was \u201cnot going to request the [statutory] ... language about the ... presumption.\u201d See Super. Ct.Crim. R. 30; Russell v. United States, 698 A.2d 1007, 1012 (D.C.1997). Appellant has not shown plain error, see United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), in the judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction.\nWe publish this opinion only to explain why appellant\u2019s separate conviction for operating a motor vehicle without a permit must be reversed. She contends that the trial judge erroneously admitted into evidence, over her objection on confrontation grounds, a document from a D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles official certifying that its records revealed no evidence of an operator\u2019s permit having been issued to appellant. This certificate of no-record (CNR), appellant argues, was \u201ctestimonial\u201d under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions beginning with Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and it was improperly admitted \u201cwithout live testimony to establish that Mrs. Tabaka did not possess a valid operator\u2019s permit.\u201d In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), we agree.\nIn Melendez-Diaz, the Court held \u2014 in keeping with its prior decisions in Crawford and Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) \u2014 that \u201caffidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine\u201d were testimonial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment and, therefore, had been improperly admitted into evidence without testimony by the chemical analysts subject to cross-examination. \u2014 U.S. at -, -, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2009 WL 1789468, at *2, *13. In the course of rejecting contrary arguments, the Court dealt with a claim that the analysts\u2019 affidavits were \u201c \u2018akin to the types of official and business records admissible at common law.\u2019 \u201d Id. at-, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2009 WL 1789468, at*10 (citation omitted). That class of records, the Court replied, bore the hallmark of \u201chaving been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial,\u201d id. at-, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2009 WL 1789468, at *11; and, in such a case, \u201c[a] clerk could by affidavit authenticate or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record.\u201d Id. at-, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2009 WL 1789468, at *10 (emphasis in original). But what a clerk could not do, without an opportunity for confrontation by the defense, was \u201cwhat the analysts did here: create a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant,\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). In that regard,\n[f]ar more probative here are those cases in which the prosecution sought to [introduce] into evidence a clerk\u2019s certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it. Like the testimony of the analysts in this case, the clerk\u2019s statement would serve as substantive evidence against the defendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the record for which the clerk searched. Although the clerk\u2019s certificate would qualify as an official record under respondent\u2019s definition \u2014 it was prepared by a public officer in the regular course of his official duties \u2014 and although the clerk was certainly not a \u201cconventional witness\u201d under the dissent\u2019s approach, the clerk was nonetheless subject to confrontation.\nId.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s analysis conclusively shows that the CNR in this case, \u201ca clerk\u2019s certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it,\u201d id., was inadmissible over objection without corresponding testimony by the DMV official who had performed the search. The contrary conclusion reached by a division of this court in an analogous setting, see Millard v. United States, 967 A.2d 155, 163 (D.C.2009) (CNRs attesting to no record of license to carry a pistol or registration of firearm not \u201ctestimonial\u201d), cannot survive the holding and analysis of Melendez-Diaz. See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 940 A.2d 163, 179 (D.C.2008); Kleinbart v. United States, 604 A.2d 861, 870 (D.C.1992). And, because the CNR was the sole and sufficient proof of appellant\u2019s non-licensure to operate a motor vehicle, her conviction for that offense cannot stand.\nAccordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for DUI, direct that her conviction for OWI be vacated on remand, and reverse her conviction for driving without an operator\u2019s permit and, as to that charge, remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nSo ordered.",
