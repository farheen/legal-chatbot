After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed, we are of the opinion that the judgment dismissing the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to Super.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) was erroneous. The allegations of the complaint clearly raised a question of fact concerning actual notice. Therefore, the necessary predicate for granting of a motion to dismiss was not established. Bragg v. Warwick Shoppers World, Inc., 102 R.I. 8, 227 A.2d 582 (1967). Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is sustained, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated, and the papers in the case may be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.\nREVILACQUA, C.J., and MURRAY, J., did not participate.",
