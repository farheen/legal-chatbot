        "text": "Manly, J.\nThe case before us is brought into this Court, by WiL of certiorari from the judgment of the Chief Justice at chambers ; his judgment being* pronounced pro forma, that it might he revi\u00e9wed in this Court at this term. The ease involves the question, whether a substitute taken into the military Service of the Confederate States, under the act of April, 1862, was entitled to a discharge upon the conscription of his principal,'after the passage of the act of 6th January., 1864.\nit seems the substitute was not bound under any,act of Congress to do service on his own account, (being past 50 years of ago,) 10 ilmt the question is freed from complication ; aud is s'mply, whether the act of the government calling back into thc-sofvice the principal, puis an end' to the substitute's.to-\u2019rm of service. We think it does rot.\nAs we bad occasion to say, at the last regular term of .this Court, in the case of Walton, with the special agreement of the parties, in a case of substitution, with the consideration,-; aud mo: r. r. actuating them, the Confederate Bales have had no!'\u00a1mg to do! They acquiesced in the arrangement of the parties, 'so far as to accept one man instead of \u00a1mother, In compliance with what was supposed to be their mutual wish and convenience; aud in respect to boo Confederate States, tiro substituto stands therefore, in the light of a, volunteer for the terra of service \u00a1o which the. principal was subject; and much being the ca\u00bbe, \u00a1here is no principle we aie aware o\u00ed',-to exempt him from the performance of the full term <.\u00bbf that service, by -ivason o\u00ed' any \u00a1Union of the- government, 'which may affect the rights of his \u2019principal umkr \u00a1heir pr\u00edvale agreement.\nThere it; a-mauifest iviftiutipu, on loo part of Congress, to retain the substitute hi the rerviec ; and I talr./it, there can be no question that Congress had the power to do so speckle;:] iy, without any general legislation to cover their case No provision is made for their discharge in the act of January 1864, but they are left in che condi lien \u00edjj which-they were found \u2014 volunteers for the waj. \u2022\nWhat seems tons conclusive evidence of this' pjrrpose of the Congress to continue them in the -service is found in the act itself. It declaims, \u201c whernis, in'the present circumstances of the country, it requires fhe aid of all who are able to bear arms,- the Congress of the Confederate States (lo enact, that no person ghall be exempt from military service by reason of his having furnishe'd a substitute ; but tills act shall not ho so combrued as i<> affect persons\u2019wjio, though not linble\u2019to render military service, nevertheless, furnished subuliLu\u00edes.\u201d From this we learn two things clearly-: 1st, > hat 'tin- Confederate Niales were, in need of sold:err: in\u2019 the ih-ld ; -md 2d. \u00a1hat they expected to get \u2019 \u00ed\u2022 .*un by calling-\u2019 back into service the men who had heretofore put\u2019in :u'-t:tutes.

'\n-It is perfectly clear, tberofoif, \u00a1dnit i v.ngre.ss'inii \u2022 :e-d no such thing.
