        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nThe State Highway Department urges a reversal of our holding in State Highway Department v. Sapp, Del., 224 A.2d 598 (1966) to the effect that 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8906 is applicable in a condemnation case and that, therefore, it is within the discretion of the Trial Court to assess as costs expert witness fees in a condemnation case.\nWe have considered the various arguments made by the Department including (1) the legislative histories of 10 Del.C. \u00a7 8906 and 10 Del.C. \u00a7 6111; (2) the rule prevailing in other jurisdictions, as exemplified by In re Canda Realty Company, 9 A.2d 305, 17 N.J.Misc. 346 (1939); State v. Pellini, 75 N.J.Super. 161, 182 A.2d 566 (1962); Hartman Tobacco Company v. Argraves, 21 Conn.Sup. 343, 154 A.2d 617 (1959); 1 Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d Ed.) \u00a7 4.109; (3) the contention that in a condemnation case there is no \u201cprevailing party\u201d who should recover costs; and (4) the contention that, because \u00a7 6111 was a later enactment than \u00a7 8906, assuming irreconcilable conflict between the two Statutes, \u00a7 6111 must prevail over \u00a7 8906.\nAs to the first contention, we see nothing in the legislative histories of the Statutes to persuade us that the holding in Sapp is wrong. Under \u00a7 6111, the Department is required to pay all \u201ccosts\u201d of the condemnation proceeding. Such \u201ccosts\u201d unquestionably include ordinary witness fees; we are satisfied that, by virtue of \u00a7 8906, such \u201ccosts\u201d may also include expert witness fees.\nAs to the second argument, differences in statutory provisions make cases from other jurisdictions inapposite.\nAs to the third contention, the imposition of all \u201ccosts\u201d upon the Department by the express provision of \u00a7 6111 results in giving the property owner a preferred position in this respect in all condemnation cases.\nAnd as to the fourth point, we expressly ruled on this point in Sapp; we are not convinced we erred therein.\nAccordingly, we adhere to the ruling in the Sapp case.\nThe Department urges a very restricted application of the Sapp rule, asking us to limit expert witness fees thereunder to time actually spent on the witness stand. This, in our opinion, is unreasonably restrictive. As we stated in Sapp, expert witness fees \u201cshould be limited to time necessarily spent in attendance upon the Court for the purpose of testifying.\u201d This includes, in our judgment, a reasonable time (a) traveling to and from the court house, (b) waiting in the court house for the call to the witness stand, and (c) testifying.\nIn the instant case, the witness was present in the courtroom at 10:00 A.M.; he took the stand at 11:45 A.M.; he was on the stand until 2:30 P.M. except for an intervening one hour lunch recess. We find the $100. witness fee allowed by the Trial Judge fair and reasonable and clearly within the bounds of a sound judicial discretion.\nAccordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.\nCited officially as State v. 0.0673 Acres of Land.",
