After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, it is the conclusion of this court that cause has not been shown. In rule 12(b)(6) dismissals the allegations must show that there is some insuperable bar to relief. Goldstein v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, 110 R.I. 580, 296 A.2d 112 (1972). We conclude that the passing of the statutory period of limitation provided in G.L.1956 (1985 Reenactment) \u00a7 9-1-14(b) constituted that insuperable bar.\nThe ruling of the trial justice is affirmed and the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is denied and dismissed.\nWEISBERGER, Acting C.J., did not participate.",
