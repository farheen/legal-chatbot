We are of the opinion that there was ample evidence to support the finding of the trial justice and that he committed no error in suppressing defendant\u2019s confession.\nConsequently, the appeal of the state is denied and dismissed. The order of suppression is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.",
