        "text": "HERRMANN, Chief Justice:\nIn this consolidated appeal by two plaintiffs which supplied materials and labor for the construction of a residence, we must construe \u00a7 2707 of the Delaware Mechanic\u2019s Lien Statute, (25 Del.C. ch. 27) governing residential housing. In determining the \u201cbalance due\u201d under a contract to a general contractor who defaults prior to completion, we must decide whether it is proper to offset or deduct the cost of completion and liquidated damages for delay in completion. Our holding that the cost of completion may be deducted, while liquidated damages for delay may not, follows from both the words of the Statute and our conclusion that \u00a7 2707 modified, rather than repealed, the pre-existing Delaware Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law.\nI.\nTimothy A. and Janet P. Brown contracted with Reid and Lloyd, Inc. for the latter, as general contractor, to build a residence within 120 days for the contract price of $45,027.17. Prior to completion, Reid and Lloyd defaulted and were discharged, having already received $37,200 from the Browns. The Browns completed construction for an additional $3,912.97. Therefore, the total cash cost to the Browns was $41,-112.97, rather than the contract price of $45,027.17. The contract provided a deduction of $25 for each day of delay beyond the 120 day limit, and the parties \u2022 stipulated that a delay of 254 days had occurred. There was no evidence of actual additional expense caused by delay.\nIn the construction of the residence, the general contractor was supplied with materials and labor by Ray\u2019s Plumbing, Heating and Air Conditioning Service, Inc., in the amount of $3,005, and lumber and materials by Masten Lumber and Supply Co., Inc. in the amount of $10,185.49. Because Reid and Lloyd, the general contractor, defaulted and filed for bankruptcy without paying Ray\u2019s and Masten, these suppliers filed mechanics\u2019 liens against Reid and Lloyd, and the Browns.\nII.\nOur present Mechanic\u2019s Lien Statute has its origin in the Act passed by the General Assembly in 1861 \u201csecuring to Mechanics and others payment for labor and materials in erecting or repairing any building or structure within the State of Delaware.\u201d See 12 Del.Laws ch. 117 (1861). The clear purpose of that Act (and its reeo-dification's) was to protect contractors against owners, and subcontractors and suppliers against both contractors and owners. See, e. g., J. G. Justis Co. v. Spicer, Del.Super., 95 A. 239 (1915). As noted by Judge Rodney in State v. Tabasso Homes, Del.Gen.Sess., 28 A.2d 248, 253 (1942), there are generally two types of mechanic\u2019s lien laws: \u201cUnder the New York System the lien of a sub-contractor or materialman depends upon or is limited by the amount remaining due to the contractor\u201d, and \u201cthe sub-contractor, laborer or materialman has only a derivative lien, being substituted to the right of the contractor.\u201d In contrast, \u201c[u]nder the Pennsylvania System the right of sub-contractors, laborers or materialmen does not depend at all upon any indebtedness due from the owner to the contractor, but they get a direct lien as distinguished from a derivative one. * * * Delaware follows the Pennsylvania System.\u201d 28 A.2d at 253.\nUnder such system of direct liens, the owner may be subject to double liability. \u201c[WJhere the principal contractor has abandoned the work and the owner is compelled to pay an amount in excess of the original contract price in order to have the work completed according to the contract specifications, this does not preclude a subcontractor under the original contract from establishing his lien for the full amount of his claim.\u201d 53 Am.Jur.2d \u201cMechanics\u2019 Liens\u201d \u00a7 242 (1970), citing Lyle v. Latourette, Ark. Supr., 209 Ark. 721, 192 S.W.2d 521, 525-26 (1946).\nThus in Delaware, prior to the passage of \u00a7 2707, a \u201cperson furnishing labor or materials to a contractor for the construction of any building may procure liens on the property for any unpaid amounts due from the contractor, though the debts were created without the owner\u2019s knowledge and the contractor has been paid the full agreed price.\u201d Maull v. Stokes, Del.Ch., 68 A.2d 200, 202 (1949). \u201c\u00a7 2707 was added to the mechanics\u2019 lien law [in 1970] ... to soften the harsh impact of the mechanics\u2019 lien law in the case of residential owners.\u201d Grier Lumber, Co. v. Tryon, Del.Super., 337 A.2d 323, 325 (1975).\nTherefore, in analyzing the questions presented, we must bear in mind that \u00a7 2707 seeks to eliminate the harsh result of double liability against residential homeowners. However, because \u00a7 2707 is part of the larger mechanic\u2019s lien statutory scheme, it must be interpreted in a way consistent with the general purpose of that scheme, which is to protect suppliers of labor and material. We must uphold both purposes in our interpretation because, contrary to the Browns\u2019 contentions, the General Assembly did not repeal the existing Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law and adopt the New York System when it passed \u00a7 2707. Instead, the General Assembly sought to modify the existing Law to eliminate the harsh results that occurred under it. With these principles before us, we turn to the specific questions presented in this case.\nIII.\nThe first issue is whether the amount expended by the Browns to complete their house may be set-off in determining \u201cthe extent of the balance due such contractor\u201d under \u00a7 2707.\nThe argument of the subcontractors, that when the Browns paid others to complete the house they were making bad faith payments to themselves, tortures the meaning and structure of the Statute and therefore must be rejected. The \u201cpayments\u201d that \u00a7 2707 focuses upon for the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement are those made to the general contractor. It is explicitly stated in \u00a7 2707 that \u201c[pjayments made to the contractor by the owner after service of process, as provided in \u00a7 2715 of this title, shall not be deemed to be \u2018in good faith\u2019.\u201d Clearly, the purpose of the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement is to prevent an owner from attempting to defeat a supplier\u2019s lien through payments to the general contractor. Thus, where an owner pays a general contractor after service of process under \u00a7 2715, such bad faith payments will not operate to reduce the fund to which a supplier\u2019s lien may attach.\nAfter consideration of \u201call of the relevant circumstances,\u201d Bedford v. Sussex Electrical Const. Co., Del.Supr., 382 A.2d 246, 248 (1978), we conclude that in this case payments for the cost of completion to a second general contractor after the first general contractor defaults do not constitute bad faith payments under \u00a7 2707.\nRay\u2019s and Masten argue that set-off for the cost of completion is improper under \u00a7 2707. Their arguments are unpersuasive because they ignore the intent of the General Assembly in the passage of \u00a7 2707. Although such argument may have been tenable prior to the passage of \u00a7 2707, since double liability was the evil the General Assembly tried to remove with the passage of \u00a7 2707, set-off for the cost of completion must be allowed, otherwise we will not be carrying out the clear present purpose of \u00a7 2707.\nAppellants also contend that set-off for the cost of completion should not be permitted because the Browns assumed the role of general contractor when they terminated payments to Reid and Lloyd; that, therefore, they must hold the unpaid balance of the contract in trust for the benefit of the subcontractors under 6 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3502 and 3503. We find this contention wholly un-meritorious in the light of \u00a7 2707.\nEven prior to the passage of \u00a7 2707, our courts concluded that \u201cset-off is a good and appropriate plea in an action of this kind.\u201d Voigtmann v. Wilmington Trust Bldg. Corp., Del.Super., 78 A. 920, 921 (1908). The passage of \u00a7 2707 should resolve any doubt about the validity of allowing a set-off for the cost of completion where a general contr\u00e1ctor defaults.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s allowance of the cost of completion as a set-off. We hold that the \u201cextent of the balance of the payment due such contractor\u201d under \u00a7 2707 is to be computed as follows: the $37,200 paid to Reid and Lloyd, plus the $3,912.97 set-off for cost of completion, totalling $41,112.97, subtracted from the contract price of $45,027.17, producing a balance of $3,914.20 due the general contractor.\nIV.\nIn the light of the Statute\u2019s dual purpose of protecting suppliers from losses and homeowners from double liability, a proper interpretation of \u00a7 2707 does not permit the Superior Court\u2019s decision to allow a liquidated damages set-off or deduction for the delay in the completion of the house. Disallowing such deduction for the delay does not leave these homeowners subject to double liability; it simply means that the homeowners obtain their house at the original contract price. If the homeowners were allowed to deduct liquidated damages for delay, there would be an offset of $6,350 (254 days times $25 per day) which, if added to the $41,112.97 (the amount paid to the general contractor plus the cost of completion), would leave no balance due to the contractor reachable by the lienholders. Although the Browns had expected to pay $45,027.17 for their house, an offset for delay would allow them to have their house for the sum of $41,112.97, at the expense of the lienholders. As has been said, \u00a7 2707 was intended to eliminate double liability to homeowners, not to grant them a windfall at the expense of parties the overall statutory scheme was also enacted to protect.\nBecause the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Statute is in derogation of the common law, Ceritano Brickwork, Inc. v Kirkwood Industries, Inc., Del.Supr., 276 A.2d 267, 268 (1971), we must interpret it strictly. Allowing a set-off for contractual liquidated damages for delay, at the expense of supplier subcontractors, would violate this principle of statutory construction. Although such set-off might be permissible against the general contractor who caused the delay, it would be manifestly unfair, and beyond any permissible construction of the Statute, to make the subcontractors suffer for the general contractor\u2019s mistakes, especially where the result produces a windfall for the homeowner. Abe Schild Stone Corp. v. Apostle, N.Y. Supr., 41 Misc.2d 732, 246 N.Y.S.2d 446 (1964). In that case, it was stated:\n\u201cConcerning the owner\u2019s claim for credit in the amount of liquidated damages provided in the contract by reason of the general contractor\u2019s delay in performance, the court has not allowed same. No reported case dealing with the subject in this context has been cited to or found by the court. While such claim might be asserted under appropriate conditions against the persons so agreeing, it seems to me that it should not be permitted to diminish or extinguish the amount of liens provided by law for the protection of the subcontractors and materialmen, whose labor and material have gone into the construction.\u201d 246 N.Y.S.2d at 450.\nAlthough there is some authority for the rule that an owner may deduct, against a subcontractor\u2019s claim, actual expenditures incurred by the owner as the result of the general contractor\u2019s delay [see e. g., Consolidated Cut Stone Co. v. Seidenbach, Okl. Supr., 181 Okl. 578, 75 P.2d 442, 448 (1937); and Fossett v. Rock Island Lumber and Mfg. Co., Kan.Supr., 76 Kan. 428, 92 P. 833 (1907)], we are of the view that the history and structure of the Delaware Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law mandates a contrary result.\nAccordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court allowing the homeowners to deduct $6,350 as liquidated damages for delay in completing the house. Without this set-off, the balance due on the contract under \u00a7 2707, to which a lien may attach, is $3,914.20 ($45,027.17 minus $41,112.97). By the terms of \u00a7 2707, this balance of $3,914.20 \u201cshall be payable pro rata among the claimants who perfect liens.\u201d\nAffirmed as to costs of completion; reversed as to liquidated damages for delay.\n. 25 Del.C. \u00a7 2707 provides:\n\u201cNo lien shall be obtained under this chapter upon the lands, structure, or both, of any owner which is used solely as a residence of said owner when the owner has made either full or final payment to the contractor, in good faith, with whom he contracted for the construction, erection, building, improvement, alteration or repair thereof. Prior to or simultaneous with the receipt of any full or final payment by the contractor, the contractor must provide the owner either (1) a notarized, verified written certification that the contractor has paid in full for all labor performed and materials furnished to the date of such full or final payment in or for such construction, erection, building, im.provement, alteration or repair or (2) a written release of mechanics\u2019 liens signed by all persons who would otherwise be entitled to avail themselves of the provisions of this chapter, containing a notarized, verified certification signed by the contractor that all of the persons signing the release constitute all of the persons who have furnished materials and performed labor in and for the construction, erection, building, improvement, alteration and repair to the date of the release and who would be entitled otherwise to file mechanics\u2019 liens claims. Failure of the contractor to provide the owner a written certification or a release of mechanics\u2019 liens at such time shall constitute sufficient cause for the immediate suspension, revocation or cancellation of the contractor\u2019s occupational and business licenses. If the owner has not made full payment in good faith to such contractor, the lien may be obtained in accordance with this chapter, but it shall be a lien only to the extent of the balance of the payment due such contractor, which balance or portion shall be payable pro rata among the claimants who perfect liens. Payments made to the contractor by the owner after service of process, as provided in \u00a7 2715 of this title, shall not be deemed to be \u2018in good faith.\u2019 \u201d\n. This Court approved the Grier Court\u2019s view of \u00a7 2707 in Bedford v. Sussex Electrical Const. Co., Del.Supr., 382 A.2d 246, 247-48 (1978).\n. 25 Del.C. \u00a7 2715 provides:\n\u201c\u00a7 2715. Issuance and service of scire facias.\n\u201cThe writ shall be issued, returnable and served in the same manner as other writs of scire facias upon the defendant therein named, if he can be found within the county. A copy of the writ shall be left with some person residing in the structure to which the labor was done or for which the materials were furnished, if occupied as a place of residence, but if not so occupied, the sheriff shall affix a copy of such writ upon the door or other front part of such structure.\u201d\n. \u00a7 3502 provides:\n\u201cAll moneys or funds received by a contractor in connection with a contract for the erection, construction, completion, alteration or repair of any building or for additions to a building and all moneys or funds received by a contractor in connection with a contract for the sale of land and the erection, construction, completion, alteration or repair of any building or addition thereon, shall be trust funds in the hands of the contractor.\u201d\n\u00a7 3503 provides:\n\u201cNo contractor, or agent of a contractor, shall pay out, use or appropriate any moneys or funds described in \u00a7 3502 of this title until they have first been applied to the payment of the full amount of all moneys due and owing by the contractor to all persons (including surveyors and engineers) furnishing labor or material (including fuel) for the erection, construction, completion, alteration or repair of, or for additions to, such building, whether or not the labor or material entered into or became a component part of any such building or addition and whether or not the same were furnished on the credit of such building or addition or on the credit of such contractor.\u201d\n. The Superior Court concluded that the $25 per diem penalty was a valid liquidated damages clause and allowed this amount to be offset. However, it failed to address the crucial question of whether a proper interpretation of the Statute allows an offset for delay.",
