      {
        "text": "STEADMAN, Associate Judge:\nAppellant Mary Cooper challenges two evidentiary rulings made by the trial court during the trial of her slip and fall claim for personal injury damages against ap-pellee, Safeway Stores. Specifically, appellant claims that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to allow a medical expert, who was not listed in the parties\u2019 joint pretrial statement, to testify as a \u201crebuttal\u201d witness, and by admitting as impeachment evidence, on the third day of trial, a videotape showing appellant engaging in various activities in her backyard, although this evidence also was not listed in the pretrial statement. We affirm the judgment, after a jury trial, in favor of appellee.\nI.\nA. The Exclusion of Expert Testimony\nAppellant filed suit against appellee claiming that, on March 13, 1988, she slipped and fell in the produce section of one of appellee\u2019s stores, causing injury to her back and left knee. The parties filed a Joint Pretrial Statement in January, 1991. In this statement, appellant identified as an expert witness only her treating physician, Dr. Luis Bentolila. Dr. Bentolila referred appellant to an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Walter Abendschein, in March, 1991. On July 28, 1991, appellee filed a motion in limine asking the court to limit Dr. Bento-lila\u2019s testimony by prohibiting him from testifying as to the observations, opinions, conclusions or diagnoses of Dr. Abend-schein. On August 22, 1991, the day of trial, the trial court informed counsel that it was granting this motion in part by prohibiting Dr. Bentolila from testifying to the opinions and diagnoses of Dr. Abendschein with the exception that Dr. Bentolila could testify as to Dr. Abendschein\u2019s diagnosis of chondrocalcinosis.\nAt trial, Dr. Bentolila testified on direct examination that, as a result of her fall at the Safeway store, appellant suffered from radiculitis and that she had sustained some damage to ligaments in her left knee causing pain and instability. He testified that both of these conditions were permanent. Dr. Bentolila also testified to a limited degree concerning appellant\u2019s treatment by Dr. Abendschein, and concerning the diagnosis of another doctor finding that appellant suffered from radiculitis.\nAppellee presented the expert testimony of Dr. David Linehan, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Linehan examined appellant in November, 1989. He testified that appellant had chondrocalcinosis in the knee, a degenerative condition that was not accident induced. He also described tests that he performed to evaluate appellant\u2019s back and spine and to test for radiculitis. Dr. Linehan stated that during a straight leg lifting test, appellant claimed to have pain when lifting her leg to a thirty degree angle while lying down, but when he performed the same test from a sitting position, he could flex her leg to ninety degrees. From this test, Dr. Linehan concluded that appellant was \u201cdissembling\u201d or \u201cnot being straight up with [him].\u201d When appellee\u2019s attorney asked if he thought appellant was \u201clying,\u201d Dr. Linehan responded \u201cyes.\u201d He concluded that any problems appellant had with her back and knee were not related to a fall in the Safeway store.\nOn cross-examination, appellant\u2019s attorney asked Dr. Linehan questions concerning Dr. Abendschein. He elicited testimony that Dr. Linehan and Dr. Abendschein\u2019s training and board certification were the same; that Dr. Abendschein\u2019s \u201cphysical findings\u201d were \u201cabout the same\u201d as his, and that Dr. Abendsehein\u2019s diagnosis was the same as his. Appellant\u2019s attorney also elicited testimony that Dr. Abendschein found tenderness around the knee. Dr. Linehan stated that he found tenderness as well, noting that this finding was based on appellant\u2019s subjective statements.\nOn the third day of trial, appellant asked that Dr. Abendschein be allowed to testify \u201cas [a] rebuttal witness[ ] or whatever,\u201d even though he was not listed in the pretrial statement, because he would be \u201crebutting\u201d Dr. Linehan by testifying about his opinions which were \u201cdiametrically [in] contradiction to ... Dr. Linehan\u2019s testimony.\u201d He proffered that Dr. Abendschein would testify that he was treating appellant for a \u201creal injury\u201d and emphasized that Dr. Linehan had testified that appellant did not have an injury and that Dr. Abendschein agreed with him. Appellee opposed appellant\u2019s request. The trial court ruled that Dr. Abendschein\u2019s testimony did not qualify as rebuttal because Dr. Linehan\u2019s opinion was \u201cclearly predictable\u201d based on the discovery that was done pretrial. It concluded that the testimony did not fit into any exception to the pretrial statement disclosure rule and accordingly denied appellant\u2019s request.\nB. The Admission of Videotape Evidence\nAppellant, Mary Cooper, testified on direct-examination as to the limitations that her physical injuries placed on her daily activities. She stated that she could not stand for very long, and that when she came down steps, she \u201cmostly\u201d did so \u201clike a two year old child,\u201d one foot at a time. Sometimes she slid down the stairs and pushed herself up them backwards. She also stated that since the accident she needed help with the household duties and shopping. On cross-examination, appellant reiterated that she had difficulty doing housework and going up and down stairs. She elaborated on the ways in which she went up and down stairs, and claimed that when using the stairs, she used a banister. She stated that she had these problems with stairs since the accident and indicated that they continued to the present. She stated that she sometimes used a cane to walk around the house and when she got out of the car, and that she would not drive at times because she would become nervous.\nIn the defense case, on the third day of trial, appellee proffered, as impeachment evidence, a videotape of appellant that had been taken a few weeks before trial. Ap-pellee stated that the tape would show appellant going up and down stairs, going away from the house unassisted, and performing minor tasks without assistance. Appellee asserted that the videotape was being offered for impeachment of appellant\u2019s and her daughter\u2019s testimony, and to show that they misrepresented facts that related to the extent of damages. Appellant\u2019s attorney opposed the admission of the evidence, arguing that it was surprise evidence and that appellant was not contending that she was bedridden, only that she had diminished capabilities. The trial court concluded that the evidence was proper \u201cfor presentation on the issues of damages and general credibility \u2014 impeachment.\u201d\nII.\nWe first address the exclusion, as rebuttal evidence, of the testimony of Dr. Abendschein. A trial court has broad discretion in the admission or exclusion of expert testimony generally, see, e.g., Payne v. Soft Sheen Products, Inc., 486 A.2d 712, 726 (D.C.1985); in interpreting pretrial orders, see Keyes v. Lauga, 635 F.2d 330, 335 (5th Cir.1981); in refusing to admit evidence which was required to be disclosed in a pretrial statement, see Hillman v. Funderburk, 504 A.2d 596, 601 (D.C.1986) (expert not listed in pretrial statement); District of Columbia v. Sterling, 578 A.2d 1163, 1167 (D.C.1990) (defense not listed in pretrial statement), and in deciding what constitutes proper rebuttal evidence, see Lacy v. District of Columbia, 424 A.2d 317, 324 (D.C.1980); Swanson & Youngdale, Inc. v. Seagrave Corp., 561 F.2d 171, 174 n. 6 (8th Cir.1977).\nA trial court may properly \u201cexclude as rebuttal testimony that which should have been introduced by the plaintiff in his [or her] case in chief,\u201d Brennan v. Jones, 176 A.2d 877, 878 (D.C.1962), and generally should exclude such evidence unless sufficient reason is offered for not introducing it at the proper time. Lacy, supra, 424 A.2d at 324. Moreover, if testimony would be cumulative of the case in chief, the trial court may disallow it as surplusage. Brennan, supra, 176 A.2d at 878. A plaintiff may not reopen his or her main case under the guise of rebuttal. Id.\nIn Hillman, supra, this court faced a situation very similar to the case here. There, the appellant/plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit arising out of a breast reduction operation claimed that the trial court had erroneously precluded an expert from testifying as a rebuttal witness. Hillman, supra, 504 A.2d at 597. The plaintiff proffered that the expert would refute certain contentions by the defendants\u2019 experts. The court noted that although the expert had at one point been listed on the plaintiffs pretrial statement, his name had later been deleted, and that he had never been the subject of discovery along with the other experts in the case. Id. at 601. In upholding the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the witness, the court found it important that the testimony would not be \u201c \u2018in the nature of true rebuttal,\u2019 \u201d citing Brennan, supra.\nIn light of these legal principles, we conclude that the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in precluding Dr. Abend-schein from testifying as a rebuttal witness. Appellant wanted Dr. Abendschein to counter the testimony of Dr. Linehan that appellant was \u201cdissembling\u201d and to show that she had suffered a \u201creal injury.\u201d However, appellant\u2019s testifying expert, in her case in chief, affirmed the legitimacy of appellant\u2019s injury and its relation to appellant\u2019s fall in the Safeway store. The trial court could properly limit evidence bolstering this contention, ruling that it should have been brought in appellant\u2019s case in chief. The record belies appellant\u2019s claim that Dr. Linehan\u2019s testimony was a surprise to her, and there was no other persuasive reason requiring the trial court to allow as rebuttal evidence a response to testimony which the court found to be \u201cclearly predictable.\u201d As in Hillman, supra, permitting the testimony of Dr. Abendschein would, in effect, have allowed appellant to present another expert witness without giving appellee the benefit of deposing the expert or of otherwise preparing for his appearance.\nIII.\nWe next address the admission of the videotape evidence. \u201c[T]he basic aim of all credibility rules ... [is] to admit evidence which better enables the trier of fact on the basis of his experience to determine whether it is reasonable to conclude that the witness is lying or telling the truth.\u201d 3 Jack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, II 607[02] (1992). \u201cImpeachment by contradiction or specific error is a technique well-recognized in the federal courts by which specific errors in the witness\u2019 testimony are brought to the attention of the trier of fact.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 607[05] (citing cases). Here, appellant had testified that she was compelled to use various laborious methods to go up and down stairs, and that she needed assistance while shopping and performing household duties. Appellee proffered to the trial court that it would show appellant going up and down stairs \u201coutside her home and elsewhere,\u201d moving away from the house unassisted, and performing household duties without assistance.\nAs noted previously, the trial court has discretion in interpreting its pretrial orders, see Keyes, supra, 635 F.2d at 335, and in the admission of evidence generally, Morrison v. United States, 547 A.2d 996, 998 (D.C.1988). The trial court\u2019s rule requiring disclosure of exhibits in the pretrial statement specifically exempted exhibits for impeachment. Here appellee proffered the evidence \"in direct impeachment of [appellant\u2019s and her daughter\u2019s] testimony.\u201d The trial court agreed with this characterization of the evidence and ruled that the video was proper for \u201cgeneral credibility \u2014 impeachment.\u201d Given the posture of the testimony in the case, we can find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in interpreting and applying its pretrial order by admitting the videotape. Cf. Patterson v. United States, 580 A.2d 1319, 1322-24 (D.C.1990).\nAffirmed.\n.Appellant's husband, now deceased, also filed suit claiming loss of consortium. Appellant appeals both personally and as representative of her husband\u2019s estate.\n. Safeway's cross-appeal, asserting that its motion for a directed verdict should have been granted, is thus rendered moot.\n. See Super.Ct.Civ.R. 16(d).\n. The parties were subject to the trial court\u2019s requirement that witnesses and exhibits not listed in the joint pretrial statement would not be allowed \"except for impeachment or other purpose unforeseeable in advance.\"\n. In a footnote in her brief, appellant indicated that she thought the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine was erroneous. At oral argument, however, appellant stated that she was not contesting this ruling.\n. Dr. Bentolila explained that this was inflammation of the root of a spinal nerve which caused pain to appellant\u2019s leg.\n. Dr. Bentolila testified to Dr. Abendschein\u2019s diagnoses of lumbosacral strain and chondro-calcinosis. He stated that the latter refers to calcium deposits on cartilage, a degenerative condition that may cause no pain or discomfort and is unrelated to injury or trauma. He also described the treatment Dr. Abendschein was providing for appellant and testified as to the reasonableness of Dr. Abendschein\u2019s fees.\n. Dr. Linehan also described a test where he moved appellant\u2019s big toe up and down and asked her if it made her back hurt. Appellant\u2019s affirmative response was described by Dr. Line-han as not being \"physiological\u201d because \"it [does not] happen like that.\u201d\n. Dr. Linehan was describing Dr. Abendschein\u2019s treatment of appellant\u2019s knee when this statement was made.\n. Although the trial judge\u2019s guidelines did not specifically provide that rebuttal witnesses could testify without being listed on the pretrial statement, the transcript indicates that the judge considered a true rebuttal witness to fall within the exception, see note 4 supra, and Super.Ct.Civ.R. 16(d) creates an exception to the pretrial statement rule for both impeachment and rebuttal witnesses.\n. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued that he did not anticipate that Dr. Linehan would testify \"about [appellant] having no treatable injury \u2014 that she is lying about it; she is dissembling about her physical condition; and that he agrees with Dr. Abendschein\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d\n. Appellee argued that only factual impeachment witnesses could be allowed without being listed on the pretrial statement and that in any event, Dr. Abendschein would be neither a rebuttal nor an impeachment witness. Appellee asserted that Dr. Abendschein would be, in effect, merely another expert opinion. Appellee asserted that it would not be able to handle the witness effectively since it did not have the opportunity to depose him.\n. Appellant's daughter testified that her mother \"doesn\u2019t move around\u201d and \"doesn\u2019t like to go downstairs.\u201d She stated that appellant liked someone to walk in front of her on the stairs and that she used a banister. She also stated that she and her son ran errands for appellant.\n. Apparently the tape showed appellant going up and down two steps in her backyard without using a handrail.\n. The court specifically stated that appellant would have a chance to rebut what the jury saw in the video. Appellant, in her reply brief, alleges that the court \u201cimproperly refused to allow her to rehabilitate her credibility\u201d after the videotape was shown. However, there is no evidence in the record indicating that appellant asked for permission to comment on the videotape or that the court refused such a request. It is appellant\u2019s burden to present this court with a record sufficient to show affirmatively that error occurred. Cobb v. Standard Drug Co., 453 A.2d 110, 111 (D.C.1982).\n. Specifically, the plaintiffs expert in Hillman would refute defense contentions that plaintiffs photographs of her breasts were misleading; that scars on plaintiffs breasts were hardly visible; that the doctor who performed the reduction acted within the necessary standard of care; and that proposed corrective surgery would cost no more than $5,200. Hillman, supra, 504 A.2d at 598-99.\n. Appellant also alleged that she wanted Dr. Abendschein to counter Dr. Linehan\u2019s statement that he and Dr. Abendschein agreed on certain findings. Dr. Linehan testified only that Dr. Abendschein\u2019s physical findings were \"about the same\" as his and that Dr. Abendschein\u2019s \u201cdiagnosis was the same as [his] and [Dr. Abend-schein] gave her a cortisone shot in the knee.\u201d Initially, we note that these statements were elicited by appellant on cross-examination and appellant made no attempt to clarify what the statements meant, making her claim of error considerably less compelling. Dr. Linehan\u2019s statement that his diagnosis was the same as Dr. Abendschein\u2019s can fairly be interpreted in context to mean his diagnosis of chondrocalcinosis in the knee, since he described the treatment that Dr. Abendschein gave appellant for her knee in the same sentence. This was in fact Dr. Abendschein's diagnosis and thus need not be rebutted. Likewise, Dr. Linehan testified that he, like Dr. Abendschein, found appellant to have tenderness in the knee. Without clarification to the contrary, we cannot assume that these physical findings were not findings that were (as Dr. Linehan testified) \"about the same\u201d as Dr. Linehan\u2019s. Lastly, we note that when discussing appellant\u2019s \"dissembling,\u201d Dr. Line-han was discussing his own findings and in no way referred to Dr. Abendschein.\n. Attached to appellee\u2019s pretrial motion in li-mine is Dr. Linehan\u2019s report to appellee after examining appellant. In the letter, Dr. Linehan concludes that appellant\u2019s response to certain knee and toe movement was \u201cbizarre\" and \"not physiologic.\u201d He also describes the same straight leg test that he testified to at trial and concludes that appellant's reaction was \"not physiologic.\u201d\n. Appellant also argued to the trial court and again on appeal that the reason she had not listed Dr. Abendschein as an expert witness on the joint pretrial statement was that Dr. Bentoli-la referred appellant to Dr. Abendschein only after the pretrial statement had been filed. However, it is clear from the record that the trial court allowed amendments of the pretrial statement and that appellant knew how to move for such an amendment. In late July, 1991, albeit before appellee\u2019s motion to limit Dr. Ben-tolila\u2019s testimony, appellant requested and received permission to amend the pretrial statement to include a copy of the bill for Dr. Abend-schein\u2019s services as an exhibit.\n. This alone belies appellant's broad equitable argument that both the motion concerning Dr. Abendschein and the motion concerning the videotape should have been granted or neither. Dr. Abendschein\u2019s testimony was basically designed to show that Dr. Linehan\u2019s medical conclusions were wrong, while the videotape was introduced to show that appellant\u2019s testimony was false with respect to facts within the personal knowledge of appellant, a direct credibility challenge. The issues were independent and a trial court\u2019s role is to deal with each required ruling on its own merits.\n.The trial court also admitted the videotape \"for presentation on the issues of damages.\" By allowing the evidence to be considered in assessing damages, the trial court admitted it as substantive evidence which was subject to the disclosure requirement. See R. & G. Orthopedic Appliances and Prosthetics, Inc. v. Curtin, 596 A.2d 530, 537 n. 10 (D.C.1991). However, any error in this regard was harmless given all the circumstances here, including the fact that the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee and thus found no liability of any kind.\nAt oral argument before the court, appellant asserted that the videotape should not have been admitted as evidence because no foundation was laid for its admission in the questioning of appellant. The trial court record indicates, however, that a proffer was made and argument heard by the trial judge, who made a ruling. At the time of the proffer and argument before the trial judge, it was undisputed that the videotapes showed appellant at the relevant place and time. Further, the trial judge specifically stated that he would permit appellant to be recalled after the videotape had been played to the jury, thereby affording appellant an opportunity to mitigate any prejudice as a result of late notice of the videotape. Appellant apparently chose to decline the opportunity to testify again. See note 15, supra.",
