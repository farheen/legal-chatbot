        "text": "THOMPSON, Associate Judge:\nOn March 7, 2008, the Supreme Court of Florida imposed upon respondent Montgomery Blair Sibley a three-year suspension from the practice of law in that jurisdiction, with his reinstatement conditioned upon a showing of fitness. The Board on Professional Responsibility (\u201cthe Board\u201d) has recommended that this court impose identical reciprocal discipline as to practice in the District of Columbia. Respondent contends that the presumption in favor of identical reciprocal discipline is overcome in this case, because the proceedings in Florida did not meet the requirements of due process and because there was an infirmity of proof to establish the charged misconduct. We conclude that respondent has failed to support his contentions with clear and convincing evidence, and we therefore adopt the Board\u2019s recommendation.\nI.\nUnder the terms of respondent\u2019s divorce-settlement agreement, which was incorporated into a court order of divorce, upon his move from South Florida, respondent was required to pay his former wife $4,000 each month to fulfill his child-support obligation to their three children. Respondent left Florida in May of 2000 and moved to the District of Columbia. Thereafter, he failed to pay any child support for 25 months, falling $100,000 behind in his payments. On August 5, 2002, the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida (the \u201cFlorida Family Court\u201d) issued an order requiring respondent to pay $30,000 of the past-due child support by October 1, 2002, $30,000 by November 1, 2002, and $40,000 by December 1, 2002, while also satisfying his ongoing child-support obligation of $4,000 per month. At a hearing on November 22, 2002, finding that as of that date respondent had failed to make any of the required payments, the court held respondent in civil contempt and ordered him incarcerated until he purged himself of contempt. The court notified the Florida Bar of the contempt finding.\nIn a separate matter, on November 3, 2004, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal (\u201cthe Third District\u201d) entered an order sanctioning respondent for filing \u201cvexatious and meritless litigation.\u201d Sibley v. Sibley, 885 So.2d 980, 988 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004). The court found that respondent had \u201crepeatedly tried to re-litigate matters decided in earlier proceedings, without any legitimate basis to do so[,]\u201d id. at 986, and had filed over three dozen non-meritorious appeals or lawsuits, including twenty-seven appellate proceedings in the Third District and \u201cat least twelve actions in federal court against judges who have been assigned to his cases.\u201d See id. at 986, 987-88 & app. (cataloguing respondent\u2019s litigation history). The Third District Court order precluded respondent from any further self-representation in that court. Id. at 988.\nOn July 14, 2006, the Florida Bar filed a complaint against respondent, charging him with violating Florida Bar Rules 4-8.4(h) (willful refusal to pay a child-support obligation) and 4-3.1 (non-meritorious claims and contentions). The Supreme Court of Florida appointed a Referee to hear the matter. The Referee found that respondent had willfully failed to pay child support and had initiated meritless litigation, in violation of Florida Bar Rules 4-8.4(h) and 4-3.1, and recommended that respondent be suspended for three years. On March 7, 2008, the Supreme Court of Florida approved the Referee\u2019s report and ordered the recommended suspension (which, under Florida law, triggers a requirement to show fitness for reinstatement).\nRespondent advised the District of Columbia Office of Bar Counsel of the Florida discipline, and Bar Counsel notified this court on April 11, 2008. On May 8, 2008, we suspended respondent on an interim basis and referred the matter to the Board for its recommendation as to whether we should issue a final order imposing identical reciprocal discipline, or whether a de novo disciplinary proceeding was warranted. In its Report and Recommendation dated November 14, 2008, the Board recommended that this court impose identical reciprocal discipline.\nII.\nWith regard to attorney-discipline cases that come to us as reciprocal matters, D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 11(c) establishes a rebuttable presumption in favor of this court\u2019s imposition of discipline identical to that imposed by the original disciplining jurisdiction. See In re Zilberberg, 612 A.2d 832, 834 (D.C.1992); see also In re Hallal, 944 A.2d 1085, 1087 (D.C.2008). The presumption applies unless the party opposing discipline (or urging non-identical discipline) shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that an exception should be made on the basis of one or more of the grounds set out in Rule XI, \u00a7 lllcXl)-\u00a9. In re Zdravkovich, 831 A.2d 964, 969-70 (D.C.2003). Rule XI, \u00a7 11(c) imposes a \u201crigid standard,\u201d as to which exceptions \u201cshould be rare.\u201d Id. at 968, 969. \u201c[Reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline.\u201d Id. at 969.\nIII.\nRespondent argues that an exception is warranted in his case on the basis of Rule XI, \u00a7 11(c)(1) and (2). He relies on the following procedural history as the basis of his claims that the Florida proceedings were lacking in due process and that there was an infirmity of proof to support the Florida discipline.\nDuring the proceedings before the Florida Referee, the Florida Bar filed a motion to strike the affirmative defenses that respondent raised in his answer to the Florida Bar Complaint. Respondent asserts that the Referee granted the motion to strike \u201cwithout affording [respondent] an opportunity to be heard in opposition.\u201d The Referee also did not rule on a request by respondent for the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum to the Florida Family Court judge who held respondent in contempt and to five judges of the Third District, all of whom respondent sought to question about what he alleges were the \u201ctrue motives\u201d and the bias and hostility toward respondent that lay behind their orders adverse to respondent.\nThe Referee explained in his final Report that, to schedule the final hearing, he left messages for respondent, seeking to identify a time when he would be available. Receiving no response from respondent, on March 28, 2007, the Referee issued an order setting April 16, 2007, as the hearing date. Respondent contends that the Referee never checked with him about his availability for a hearing, and that he did not receive the hearing notice until April 5, 2007. At that time, he asserts, he immediately made a motion to continue the hearing for two weeks or to appear by telephone, explaining that he would be unable to attend in person on April 16 because of a professional commitment (involving a high-profile case in the District). The Referee denied the motion for a continuance. Respondent contends that the Referee also denied his request to participate by telephone. There is no indication in the record that the Referee specifically ruled on respondent\u2019s request to participate by telephone, but the Referee\u2019s Report states that \u201cRespondent failed to contact either the undersigned or counsel for the Florida Bar by telephone, facsimile, or electronic mail,\u201d and thus the \u201cfinal hearing proceeded without the Respondent being present.\u201d Thereafter, both parties submitted proposed reports on April 20, 2007, and on June 28, 2007, the Referee issued his final Report. Respondent asserts that the Referee adopted almost verbatim the Florida Bar\u2019s proposed order.\nThe matter proceeded to review by the Florida Supreme Court. That court denied respondent\u2019s request to depose the Referee about what respondent alleged were factual misrepresentations in the Referee\u2019s Report. The Florida Supreme Court also denied respondent\u2019s request for oral argument and his motion to disqualify the justices of the court. The court adopted the Referee\u2019s Report and recommendation, and through a brief per curiam order, suspended respondent. The court did not address the arguments that respondent raised in his petition for review: that he was denied a fair and impartial judiciary, that he was not put to charges made under oath, that he was denied the right to call and confront witnesses in his defense in a quasi-criminal proceeding, that his affirmative defenses were stricken improperly, and that he was being punished for having pursued federal and state court remedies.\nIV.\nCiting the foregoing procedural history, respondent argues that he \u201cwas not given a full disciplinary hearing in Florida\u201d and thus was deprived of due process. We begin our analysis by noting that the exception described in Rule XI, \u00a7 11(c)(1) requires clear and convincing evidence that \u201c[t]he procedure [in the original disciplining jurisdiction] was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process.\u201d (Emphasis added). Respondent claims a deprivation of due process on the basis of various purported deficiencies in the Florida proceedings, only some of which ostensibly relate to \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201copportunity to be heard.\u201d We address respondent\u2019s arguments, however, generously construing them as arguments that he was entitled to, but deprived of, notice of properly brought charges and an opportunity to have his case heard without undue delay by qualified and impartial judicial officers. See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 378-79, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) (explaining that due process requires \u201ca meaningful opportunity to be heard\u201d); In re Day, 717 A.2d 883, 886 (D.C.1998).\nA.\nRespondent\u2019s first deprivation-of-due-process claim is that the Florida disciplinary proceedings were brought on the basis of unsworn allegations in the Florida Bar Complaint. Respondent argues that this contravened the principle, articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Ex parte Burr, 22 U.S. 529, 6 L.Ed. 152 (1824), that \u201cthe charges, in a regular complaint against an attorney, ought not to be received and acted on, unless made on oath.\u201d Id. at 530. However, this statement in Burr \u2014 which was dictum, see In re Shepard, 109 Mich. 631, 67 N.W. 971, 971-72 (1896) \u2014 was followed by the Court\u2019s statement, in Randall v. Brigham, recognizing that\nIt is not necessary that proceedings against attorneys for ... any unprofessional conduct, should be founded upon formal allegations against them.... All that is requisite to their validity is that, when not taken for matters occurring in open court, in the presence of the judges, notice should be given to the attorney of the charges made and opportunity afforded him for explanation and defence. The manner in which the proceeding shall be conducted, so that it be without oppression or unfairness, is a matter of judicial regulation.\n74 U.S. 523, 540, 19 L.Ed. 285 (1868).\nFurther, in Florida, the common-law rule that a complaint against an attorney must be made under oath has been superseded by statute. As the Supreme Court of Florida held decades ago:\n[I]t is said that, \u201ca complaint against an attorney ought not to be received unless made on oath,\u201d citing In re Burr .... This is a statement of the common law prior to the enactment of Chapter 4379, Acts of 1895.... There is no statutory authority which compels a State attorney to file his motion to disbar under oath.... While it was formerly the practice to require all pleadings of any kind whatever, both in equity and in law, to be under oath, the old technicalities of pleading are being done away with, and rightly so, including the elimination of the oath in most actions. In view of this tendency, and by reason of the absence of statutory requirements, we cannot agree ... that a complaint against an attorney ought not to be received unless made on oath. The absence of an oath of the State attorney to a motion to disbar made under the statute is not ground for reversal.\nRichardson v. State, 141 Fla. 218, 192 So. 876, 877 (1940).\nIn addition, the Florida Bar Complaint was based upon court orders \u2014 the Florida Family Court order sanctioning respondent for failure to comply with child-support orders and the Third District order sanctioning him for \u201cvexatious and merit-less litigation\u201d \u2014 that are a matter of public record. These were a constitutionally sufficient basis for the Florida disciplinary proceedings. Cf. In re Calvo, 88 F.3d 962, 967 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding that the state court could rely on judgments against petitioner in SEC actions as a basis for disbarment); In re Shieh, 738 A.2d 814, 817-18 (D.C.1999) (holding that there was no need for sworn testimony about whether respondent or his attorneys should be disciplined for abusive filings). For all these reasons, we reject respondent\u2019s argument that he was deprived of due process in Florida insofar as the Florida discipline arose from charges \u201cnot made upon oath.\u201d\nB.\nRespondent also cites, as a due-process violation, the delay in the commencement and completion of the Florida disciplinary proceedings. To amount to a denial of due process, however, a delay in the conduct of disciplinary proceedings must prejudice the respondent\u2019s defense. See In re Ponds, 888 A.2d 234, 241 n. 22 (D.C.2005) (\u201cA delay coupled with actual prejudice could result in a due process violation.... \u201d); In re Morrell, 684 A.2d 361, 368 (D.C.1996) (same). Respondent has made no showing \u2014 let alone a showing by clear and convincing evidence \u2014 that the delay here prejudiced him in defending against the charges in Florida.\nC.\nNext, respondent contends that the Florida suspension order is void, and that due process requires that this court not rely on the rulings of the Florida courts, because the Referee and the Florida Supreme Court justices were not a \u201ccompetently constituted judiciary,\u201d in that they failed to take the loyalty oaths required by state law. We reject this argument because the Florida Supreme Court \u2014 the final arbiter of what is required under Florida law \u2014 has concluded that its justices and the Referee all satisfied the requirements of the Florida loyalty oath statute. See Florida Bar v. Sibley, 995 So.2d 346, 348-49 (Fla.2008), cert denied, - U.S. -. 129 S.Ct. 1348, 173 L.Ed.2d 615 (2009), (concluding that the Justices and Referee all took oaths \u201cin full compliance with the dictates of section 876.05 [of the Florida statutes]\u201d and rejecting respondent\u2019s interpretation of the statute). This court has no basis for disagreeing with or disregarding that judgment.\nD.\nWe next consider respondent\u2019s claim that he was deprived of an opportunity to raise and to be heard on the constitutional claims that he raised as affirmative defenses because the Referee granted the Florida Bar\u2019s motion to strike those defenses. This court has recognized that a motion to strike defenses should not be granted \u201cif the insufficiency of the defense is not clearly apparent, or if it raises factual issues that should be determined on a hearing on the merits.\u201d Franco v. National Capital Revitalization Corp., 930 A.2d 160, 166-67 (D.C.2007) (quoting 5C ChaRles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Praotioe and Prooedure \u00a7 1381, at 427-28 (3d ed. 2004) (footnotes omitted)). Respondent has suggested no reason why, under this standard and in light of the Florida Bar charges, it was improper for the Referee to strike his affirmative defenses. It is no defense to a charge of \u201cvexatious and meritless\u201d litigation that respondent has a constitutional right of access to the courts, because there is no right to access the courts to conduct vexatious litigation. See Schlicher v. Thomas, 111 F.3d 777, 781 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe right of access to the courts is neither absolute nor unconditional, and there is no constitutional right of access to the courts to prosecute an action that is frivolous or malicious.\u201d) (quoting Winslow v. Hunter, 17 F.3d 314, 315 (10th Cir.1994)). In addition, respondent has not explained what factual issues his affirmative defenses raised, such that striking the defenses deprived him of an opportunity to present proof at the hearing before the Referee. And, in any event, respondent did have the opportunity to argue his asserted defenses in the proposed report that he submitted to the Referee and in his briefs to the Florida Supreme Court.\nE.\nAnother of respondent\u2019s due-process claims is that he was not permitted to confront his accusers, because the Referee did not grant his request for subpoenas to compel the testimony of the Florida Family Court judge and judges of the Third District who sanctioned him. Although respondent suggests that his inability to obtain subpoenas implicates the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause, it is well-settled that there is \u201cno confrontation right in an attorney discipline case.\u201d In re Sibley, 564 F.3d at 1341 (citing Rosenthal v. Justices of the Supreme Court of Cal., 910 F.2d 561, 565 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe confrontation clause is a criminal law protection. Therefore, it does not apply to a disbarment case.\u201d)); see also Calvo, 88 F.3d at 967 (\u201cDisbarment proceedings are not criminal proceedings, and ... there is no right to confront witnesses face to face.\u201d) (quoting Fla. Bar v. Vannier, 498 So.2d 896, 898 (Fla.1986)).\nNor does the Fifth Amendment \u201crequire a trial-type hearing in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.\u201d Finfer v. Caplin, 344 F.2d 38, 41 (2d Cir.1965) (quoting Cafeteria & Rest. Workers, etc. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 894, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961)); Shieh, 738 A.2d at 817-18 (explaining that \u201cin the absence of any factual issues as to which sworn testimony might be necessary or even relevant,\u201d sworn testimony about the respondent\u2019s behavior is not required to ensure due process, and concluding that there was no need for sworn testimony about whether respondent or his attorneys should be disciplined for abusive filings) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Referee was \u201cwell within his discretion\u201d in not permitting respondent to subpoena the Florida judges as witnesses, because the \u201cintegrity of [the] mental process of a judge cannot be subject to scrutiny.\u201d Sibley, 564 F.3d at 1341 (citing Morgan IV, 313 U.S. at 422, 61 S.Ct. 999). Bar Counsel argues that respondent waived his right to call witnesses inasmuch as he failed to appear for the final hearing without sufficient cause. Cf. In re Richardson, supra note 5, 692 A.2d at 434 (holding that respondent waived his right to an evidentiary hearing when he chose to resign instead of continuing with the disciplinary proceedings). We are unwilling to conclude that there was an actual waiver since respondent notified the Referee of his conflict and unavailability and sought a continuance of the hearing. However, we agree with Bar Counsel that the Referee\u2019s refusal to grant respondent\u2019s motion for a continuance and the Referee\u2019s conduct of the hearing in respondent\u2019s absence did not amount to a denial of due process.\nRespondent emphasizes that the Referee denied respondent\u2019s request for a two-week continuance to accommodate his preexisting professional obligations, even though the mailed notice of hearing afforded respondent only ten days\u2019 notice of the hearing date, and even though the Referee had allowed the proceedings to move slowly and to drag on past the date initially set by the Florida Supreme Court for issuance of the Referee\u2019s Report. In some circumstances, a court\u2019s unreasonable refusal to grant a requested continuance may support a finding of deprivation of due process. See In re Zdravkovich, 831 A.2d at 969. We cannot reach that conclusion here, because the only witnesses respondent indicates he wished to call at the live hearing were the judges whose mental processes he was not entitled to probe. Thus, respondent has not shown what he could properly have presented during the live hearing that he was unable to present in his written submission to the Referee.\nIn addition, while respondent contends that the Referee denied his request to participate in the hearing by telephone, the record contains no evidence that the Referee would not have permitted telephone participation, and respondent does not claim that he attempted to call the Referee or Florida Bar Counsel to join the hearing by telephone. For this reason, too, respondent has fallen far short of providing clear and convincing evidence that he was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard during the Florida disciplinary proceedings.\nF.\nRespondent contends in addition that the Florida Referee\u2019s virtual verbatim adoption of the Florida Bar\u2019s proposed order, and the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cperfunctory\u201d adoption of the Referee\u2019s Report and recommendation, evidenced a lack of due process. For this argument, he relies on Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). In Anderson, the Supreme Court did admonish against the verbatim adoption of proposed orders, see id. at 572, 105 S.Ct. 1504, but it did not declare that the practice is a violation of due process. To the contrary, the Court acknowledged that when a finder of fact adopts proposed findings of fact verbatim, the findings may be disturbed only if they are clearly erroneous. Id. Moreover, the Court\u2019s criticism of courts\u2019 \u201cverbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties\u201d was particularly directed to instances where \u201cthose findings have taken the form of conclusory statements unsupported by citation to the record.\u201d Id. Here, by contrast, the Florida Referee\u2019s Report was supported by references to Florida Family Court and Third District findings and orders that are a matter of public record.\nV.\nWe now turn to respondent\u2019s claim that there was an infirmity of proof during the Florida proceedings to establish the charged misconduct. The gravamen of respondent\u2019s infirmity-of-proof argument is that there was insufficient evidence before the Florida Referee to prove that his failure to pay child support was willful and that he filed frivolous claims and appeals. We disagree.\nAs to the Florida Family Court\u2019s contempt order for respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s child support orders, respondent takes issue with the court\u2019s finding, accepted by the Third District majority, that respondent\u2019s incarceration was warranted on the ground that he had access to funds from his wealthy father to pay the $100,000 back-child-support amount necessary to purge the contempt order. Respondent\u2019s infirmity-of-proof argument might have some merit if the basis for the Florida discipline had been respondent\u2019s incarceration for failure to pay the entire purge amount in the absence of proof that his own assets were sufficient to allow him to do so. But, strictly speaking, respondent was not disciplined in Florida for being held in contempt, but for willfully failing to pay court-ordered child support. Respondent does not dispute the Third District\u2019s observation that he paid none \u2014 \u201cnot a single cent\u201d \u2014 of the required child support. Likewise, he does not dispute the Florida Family Court\u2019s finding that he \u201chas refused to pay even a small portion of his child support obligation\u201d and also failed to \u201cpresent[ ] an alternate payment plan\u201d or the Referee\u2019s finding that he \u201cfailed to pay any of the outstanding child support.\u201d Nor has respondent given us any reason to question the Third District\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s failure to support his children, \u201ceven in the smallest part ... stems ... only from a stubborn, self-immolating hatred of and vendetta against his ex-wife ... and not from any \u2018inability to pay.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 849. Even if we questioned whether it was proper for the Florida Family Court to hold respondent in contempt, in light of these uncontested facts there is no basis for questioning the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of the Referee\u2019s finding that respondent willfully failed to meet his child-support obligation, in violation of Florida Rule 4-8.4(h).\nAs to his claim of an infirmity of proof to support the Florida Bar\u2019s second charge, respondent asserts that \u201cat no time were any of the pleadings filed by Sibley determined to be frivolous.\u201d We reject the distinction that respondent seeks to draw between \u201cmeritless\u201d claims and \u201cfrivolous\u201d claims. Respondent is correct that the Third District used the phrases \u201cwithout merit\u201d and \u201cabuse of the legal process\u201d to describe respondent\u2019s successive appeals and lawsuits. But, to justify its sanctions order, the court expressly relied on case authority recognizing that an order barring further self-representation was warranted to \u201cprevent[ ] abusive litigants from continuously filing frivolous petitions, thus enabling the Court to devote its finite resources to those who have not abused the system.\u201d Sibley, 885 So.2d at 985-86 (quoting Lussy v. Fourth Dist. Court of Appeal, 828 So.2d 1026, 1027 (Fla.2002) (citations omitted) (italics added)).\nIn concluding that respondent had filed non-meritorious claims, the Florida Referee (and the Florida Supreme Court, by adopting the Referee\u2019s Report) took notice of the Third District\u2019s catalogue of the twenty-seven appeals respondent filed in his divorce/custody case and the twelve actions he filed in federal court against judges assigned to his cases, and of the Third District\u2019s conclusion that respondent was an \u201cunending source of meritless and vexatious litigation.\u201d Respondent contends this was an insufficient basis for discipline, because the members of the panel of the Third District who drew those conclusions \u201ccould not have made their determination that Sibley\u2019s cases were \u2018meritless\u2019 in the cases they were not empaneled to decide.\u201d However, the Third District panel explained that it \u201creviewed [the] files in all of the former husband\u2019s prior appellate proceedings\u201d before entering its sanctions order. Id. at 990. Because \u201c[a]ll judicial orders and judgments come with a strong presumption of regularity,\u201d Democratic State Comm. v. Bebchick, 706 A.2d 569, 574 (D.C.1998), we have no basis to question the Third District panel\u2019s statement that it reviewed the files in respondent\u2019s appeals. That review was a sufficient basis for the court to make a finding about whether respondent had brought non-meritorious litigation. Cf. Shieh, 738 A.2d at 814-16, 818 (concluding that judicial officers in the original disciplining jurisdiction \u201ctook proper judicial notice of the countless filings and flouted court orders that made up respondent\u2019s misconduct,\u201d and concluding that there was no infirmity of proof of respondent\u2019s disregard for the administration of justice, given his history of disobeying court orders and filing duplicative lawsuits, baseless motions and meritless appeals).\nRespondent insists that the \u201cbias and hostility of [the Third District] is well documented\u201d and he asserts that he was deprived of the opportunity to demonstrate \u201cthat the judicial actors who entered the orders upon which the two counts of the Florida Bar Complaint are based were not relying upon the record before them.\u201d Given respondent\u2019s reference to the motions he has lodged to disqualify members of the Third District Court for alleged unethical behavior and his description of his role as counsel for an organization called \u201cFlorida J.A.I.L. 4 Judges,\u201d we would not be surprised if respondent is not well-liked by some judges in Florida. But that possibility does not enable respondent to avoid reciprocal discipline on the ground of infirmity of proof in the original disciplining jurisdiction. In light of respondent\u2019s admissions about his non-payment of even a small portion of his child-support indebtedness and in light of the public record of his successive litigation, this is a case in which we are satisfied, notwithstanding respondent\u2019s allegations of judicial hostility and bias, \u201cthat the critical questions presented, if retried, would bring the same determination\u201d as already reached in the Florida proceedings. Thus, we reject respondent\u2019s prayer that we refrain from disciplining him without according him \u201can evidentiary hearing on the unsworn allegations putatively lodged against him by the Florida Bar.\u201d\nVI.\nRespondent has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that an exception to the presumption in favor of identical reciprocal discipline is warranted. Accordingly, we accept the Board\u2019s recommendation and suspend respondent for three years, with reinstatement conditioned upon a showing of fitness to practice law. For purposes of reinstatement, his suspension will begin to run from the date he files an affidavit in conformance with D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14(g).\nSo ordered.\n. Specifically, Rule XI \u00a7 11(c) provides that \"[rjeciprocal discipline shall be imposed unless the attorney demonstrates to the Court, by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d that:\n(1) The procedure elsewhere was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process; or\n(2) There was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that the Court could not, consistently with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that subject; or\n(3) The imposition of the same discipline by the Court would result in grave injustice; or\n(4) The misconduct established warrants substantially different discipline in the District of Columbia; or\n(5) The misconduct elsewhere does not constitute misconduct in the District of Columbia.\nD.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 11(c).\n. As affirmative defenses, respondent asserted his federal constitutional right to access to the courts and his interest as a parent in the custody of his children.\n. The Referee initially appointed to hear the matter denied respondent's first request for subpoenas duces tecum to compel depositions of the judges, ruling that a member of the judiciary \"may not be compelled to testify regarding motivations behind his or her judicial actions,\u201d citing United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941) (\"Morgan IV\u201d). The successor Referee did not rule on respondent\u2019s second request.\n. The court also denied respondent\u2019s post-suspension motions to vacate the order of suspension and his motion for reconsideration of that denial.\n. The relevant statute and rules in our jurisdiction continue to provide that attorney discipline must be based on \u201cwritten charges, under oath\u201d and that original-discipline proceedings must be \u201cinstituted by bar counsel by the filing of a petition under oath.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 11 \u2014 2503(b); D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 8(c). In reciprocal proceedings, however, \"a certified copy of a disciplinary order from another jurisdiction against a member of our bar\u201d meets these requirements. In re Richardson, 692 A.2d 427, 430 (D.C.1997).\n. The Florida suspension, ordered in 2008, arose from a 2006 Florida Bar Complaint based on the 2002 Florida Family Court contempt order and the 2004 sanction order of the Third District. Respondent asserts that the delay \"allowed the process to be the punishment.\u201d He also complains of a violation of his \"speedy trial rights.\u201d However, \"the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution simply does not apply\u201d to attorney-discipline cases. In re Sibley, 564 F.3d 1335, 1340 (D.C.Cir.2009).\n. See O\u2019Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 531, 94 S.Ct. 740, 38 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974) (recognizing that the Supreme Court may not \"construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of a State\u201d); Sibley, 564 F.3d at 1340 (\"Because administration of the relevant oaths is a question of state law, this court cannot look beyond the controlling decisions of the Florida state courts.\u201d).\n. Respondent argues that this deprived him of the ability to question these judges about their alleged hostility toward him.\n. We noted in Shieh that the need for sworn testimony was obviated by the availability of \"documentary evidence submitted by the State Bar \u2014 65 binders of documentary evidence\u201d and \"public court records swollen with respondent\u2019s filings\u201d that evidenced the charged violations, and that the issue of whether the respondent was responsible for \"abusive filings and other vexatious litigation tactics,\u201d had been \"resolved against respondent over and over again by the California courts, which repeatedly sanctioned him individually ... for litigation abuses.\u201d 738 A.2d at 817.\n. Although acknowledging the \"general rule which prohibits the deposition of judges,\u201d respondent relies on the Supreme Court's opinions in Morgan v. United States, 298 U.S. 468, 56 S.Ct. 906, 80 L.Ed. 1288 (1936) (\"Morgan I\"), and Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 14, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1938) (\"Morgan II\"). The cases involved a challenge to a rate order by the Secretary of Agriculture. Plaintiffs alleged that they were denied a full hearing before the Secretary where, at the time he signed the order, the Secretary \"had not personally heard or read\u201d any of the evidence or arguments presented and acted solely on the basis of information \"derived from consultation with employees in the Department.\u201d Morgan I, 298 U.S. at 474 n. 1, 56 S.Ct. 906. The Supreme Court held in the first of the cases that the Secretary \"should be required to answer [the] allegations,\u201d id. at 482, 56 S.Ct. 906, and the second opinion confirms that the Secretary thereafter answered interrogatories and gave testimony about his decision-making process. See Morgan II, 304 U.S. at 14, 58 S.Ct. 773. From this, respondent argues that the Florida judges were not immune from being questioned under oath about what they relied upon in sanctioning respondent.\nWhat respondent fails to note is that in a subsequent Morgan opinion, the Supreme Court overruled its earlier opinions. As explained in Nat\u2019l Nutritional Foods Ass\u2019n. v. FDA, 491 F.2d 1141 (2d Cir.1974), in Morgan IV, 313 U.S. at 421-22, 61 S.Ct. 999, the Court \"took back most or all of what the first decision had given,\u201d holding that \"the short of the business is that the Secretary should never have been subjected to this examination.\u201d Nat\u2019l Nutritional Foods, 491 F.2d at 1144 (stating that \"|j]ust as a judge cannot be subjected to such a scrutiny, ... so the integrity of the administrative process must be equally respected\u201d (citing Morgan IV, 313 U.S. at 422, 61 S.Ct. 999)). Thus, the authorities on which respondent so heavily relies do not support his claim that the Florida Referee denied him due process by not issuing subpoenas to the Florida Family Court and appellate judges to enable respondent to probe their mental processes.\n. For the same reason, we can find no deprivation of due process in the Florida Supreme Court's denial of respondent\u2019s request to depose the Referee about the mental processes that led him to recommend that respondent be suspended.\n. But see In re Edelstein, 892 A.2d 1153, 1158 (D.C.2006) (holding that an attorney is not deprived of due process, because, for whatever reason, he chooses not to appear at a scheduled hearing of which he had notice).\n. Thus, ultimately, it is irrelevant whether, as respondent claims, the Referee scheduled the hearing without attempting to contact respondent about convenient dates.\n. Respondent cites the dissenting opinion in which one judge of the Third District concluded that the record did not support a finding that respondent himself (as distinguished from his wealthy father) had the present ability to pay the $100,000 purge amount. See Sibley, 833 So.2d at 849 (Cope, J., dissenting). However, the dissent provides scant support for respondent's position here, because the dissenting judge also stated that \"[t]he present record certainly supports the proposition that the former husband is intentionally underemployed and has divested himself of assets which could have been used to pay his child support obligation,\u201d for which conduct \"the remedy is indirect criminal contempt, not civil contempt.\u201d Id. at 853.\n. We make this tentative statement in recognition of the Third District\u2019s observation that respondent \"adamantly refused to reveal many of his financial records,\u201d id. at 848 n. 2, and the Florida Family Court's finding that respondent produced \"no paycheck stubs, no credit card statements, [and] no bank statements or tax returns.\u201d We would not necessarily decline to impose reciprocal discipline on the basis of an infirmity of proof where a respondent thwarted efforts to obtain documentary proof that was in his possession.\n. Id. at 848.\n. See also White v. Reid, 126 F.Supp. 867, 869 (D.D.C.1954) (citing the \"presumption of regularity that judges obey the law and will protect fully the rights of the parties appearing before them and that judicial proceedings have conformed with due process of law\u201d).\n. And, even if we could substitute our own judgment for that of the Third District panel about whether respondent\u2019s repeated appeals lacked merit \u2014 and, to restate, that is something we may not do \u2014 respondent has made no effort to identify the purported merit in any of those appeals.\n.
