Several complaints have been filed with the Chief Counsel of this Court\u2019s Disciplinary Board charging that respondent has committed acts which constitute misconduct. On July 10, 1980, pursuant to our Rule 42-13, respondent filed an affidavit with the Board setting forth that he is aware of the charges pending against him, that he cannot successfully defend himself against such charges, and, consequently, that he freely and voluntarily consents to disbarment, he being fully aware of the implications of submitting his consent. On August 1, 1980 the Board\u2019s counsel filed respondent\u2019s affidavit with the Court together with a petition requesting that we order respondent\u2019s disbarment on consent.\nUpon review of respondent\u2019s affidavit and the Board\u2019s petition, and after careful consideration of all the factors involved, we deem such an order appropriate.\nAccordingly, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 42-13, it is hereby ordered that respondent, Arnold A. Zoglio, Jr., be and is hereby disbarred.\nDORIS, J., did not participate.",
