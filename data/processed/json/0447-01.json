        "text": "YEAGLEY, Associate Judge:\nThis appeal follows appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of marijuana, a violation of D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 33-402. In the sole argument he raises on appeal, appellant contends that the conviction must be reversed for the failure of the government to quantify the amount of tetrahydrocan-nabinol (THC) present in the approximately 8 grams of marijuana seized at his arrest. Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe chemist produced by the government at trial testified that he had examined the substance confiscated from the appellant and had determined it to be marijuana by microscopic examination and by application of the Duquenois-Levine test and a thin layer chromatography using a THC standard. The latter two procedures directly test for THC. Both proved positive on appellant\u2019s specimen but as small amounts of the chemical will trigger both tests and appellant\u2019s specimen had not been subjected to more discriminating chemical evaluation, the prosecution did not offer evidence establishing the actual amount of THC present in the 8 grams of marijuana except for the chemist\u2019s statement that THC normally will be found in virtually all of the drug taken from the leaf portion of the marijuana plant and that this portion of the plant accounted for approximately 90% of the material seized from the appellant.\nAppellant concedes that the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 33-401 et seq. offers no support for his proposition that the government\u2019s proof of a usable amount must be related to the THC content of the marijuana. Section 33-402 proscribes possession qf marijuana itself, not its constituent chemicals. It does not require the prosecution to separate and quantify the substance\u2019s active agents in order to demonstrate that the specimen found in the defendant\u2019s possession was sufficiently potent to produce a narcotic sensation. Appellant argues, however, that such proof is compelled by the decisions of this court, beginning with Edelin v. United States, D.C.App., 227 A.2d 395 (1967), where we held that proof of a violation of \u00a7 33^102 requires evidence demonstrating that the defendant possessed a \u201cusable amount\u201d of the controlled narcotic.\nWe disagree with the contention. In Edelin, we reversed the conviction of a defendant who was charged with violating \u00a7 33-402 after a search of his room uncovered certain narcotics paraphernalia which revealed microscopic traces of heroin under chemical analysis. Following a review of decisions from jurisdictions which had previously considered the conviction of a defendant charged with possession of minute amounts of a proscribed narcotic, we held \u201cthat where there is only a trace of a substance, a chemical constituent not quantitatively determined because of minuteness, and there is no additional proof of its usability as a narcotic, there can be no conviction under \u00a7 33-402(a).\u201d Edelin v. United States, supra at 399. Edelin went no further than to recognize in the common sense application of the statute that where the seized substance is of an amount so inconsiderable as to make it of no utility to a user and unmarketable, it is not such a narcotic as contemplated by Congress to be a danger to society. Id. at 398-99.\nAlthough we have held that where possession of marijuana is charged the government must prove the presence of THC to establish that the seized substance is from the portion of the plant proscribed by statute, we have not stepped beyond the holding in Edelin to require that the government directly prove the seized substance\u2019s ability to produce a meaningful narcotic influence upon the user by evidence quantifying the presence of its active agents. To the contrary, we have reviewed the government\u2019s quantitative evidence in cases of this kind solely to determine whether the record allowed a conclusion that the substance itself was present in a \u201cusable amount.\u201d In Jones v. United States, D.C.App., 318 A.2d 888 (1974), for example, a conviction was affirmed upon proof that the defendant had at the time of his arrest been in possession of a bottle filled with a greenish weedlike substance subsequently identified as marijuana. More recently, in Thomas v. United States, D.C.App., 352 A.2d 390 (1976), where the defendant challenged his conviction on the alleged failure of the government to establish that the marijuana found in his possession was from the proscribed portion of the plant, evidence which demonstrated the presence of THC in 50% of the seized substance was held sufficient to permit af-firmance.\nThe statute merely proscribes possession of marijuana without regard to the nature of the narcotic effect it might have on a user. In this respect it differs from the Volstead Act which was not directed merely at the possession of liquor, but treated with \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d.\nSection 33-402 when read with the practical exception enunciated in Edelin carries a legislative presumption that those substances identified as \u201cnarcotic drugs\u201d in D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 33-401 (m) pose a sufficient threat to the public welfare to warrant the prohibition of their possession except in such insignificant quantities as make it patent that the substance cannot be employed for a narcotic purpose. We enforce that presumption here.\nIn this case a police officer testified at trial that the amount of marijuana found in the appellant\u2019s possession could form the grist for three to five marijuana cigarettes. Cf. Payne v. United States, D.C.App., 294 A.2d 501 (1972).\nIn view of the quantity of marijuana found on the appellant at his arrest, and considering the chemist\u2019s testimony as to the THC content of that marijuana, appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal properly was denied. The judgment of conviction accordingly is\nAffirmed.\n.The chemist indicated that a milligram or tenth of a milligram of THC could have produced the color reaction observed in the Duquenois-Levine test and that a minute amount of the chemical would return a positive reaction in the thin layer chromatography.\n. The chemist testified that it was possible to run a test to determine the amount of THC present and that such a test was \u201cvery easy\u201d to perform.\n. D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7\u00a7 33-401 (m), -401 (n), -402.\n. Thomas v. United States, D.C.App., 352 A.2d 390 (1976). See D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 33-401 (m).",
