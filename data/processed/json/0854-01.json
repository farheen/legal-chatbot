In doing so, the trial court affirmed a decision of the Philadelphia Tax Review Board (Board) and rejected Principal\u2019s claim that the revenue in question was non-taxable because it was derived from the \u201cbusiness of an insurance company.\u201d We affirm in part and reverse in part.\nBACKGROUND\nThe facts in this case are not in dispute. Principal is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa and licensed to do business in Pennsylvania as a foreign insurer. As is the case for all Iowa-domiciled insurers, Principal\u2019s investments, both as to amount and type, are governed by Iowa insurance regulatory law, and it permits investments in real estate.\nOn August 19, 1986, Principal entered into a real estate mortgage loan with Broad and Locust Associates by which it obtained a hen on an office building at 280 South Broad Street (Broad Street Property). Following a default, on or about March 29, 1993, Principal foreclosed and thereby obtained a 100% fee simple ownership in the Broad Street Property. It held and operated the building by leasing it to \u2014 and collecting rent from \u2014 commercial tenants until November 29, 1999, when Principal sold the Broad Street Property to AE-South Broad Associates, LP, an unrelated third party.\nOn January 16, 1987, Principal entered into a real estate mortgage loan with 1529 Associates, by which Principal obtained a hen on an office building at 1529 Walnut Street (Walnut Street Property). Following a default, on or about August 1, 1994, Principal foreclosed and thereby obtained a 100% fee simple ownership of the Walnut Street Property. Again, Principal operated the building until September 15, 1999, when the property was sold to 1529 Walnut Street Associates, an unrelated third party.\nOn August 22, 1998, the City filed two complaints against Principal, alleging that it had failed to file BPT tax returns on its commercial realty business for the years 1993 through 1996. However, the City withdrew the complaints after Principal voluntarily submitted information to the City\u2019s Municipal Tax Bureau about the Broad Street and Walnut Street Properties. Based on this information, the City issued Principal a BPT assessment for the years 1993 through 1998 in the cumulative amount of $189,548. This amount included both the gross receipts and net income portions of the BPT. As of March 3, 2003, interest and penalties on Principal\u2019s assessment totaled $411,918.\nOn August 13, 1998, Principal filed a petition for abatement of the City\u2019s tax, interest and penalty assessment. After a hearing, on November 15, 2002, the Board issued a written decision denying Principal\u2019s petition. Principal then appealed to the trial court.\nOn March 28, 2003, after this matter was heard by the Board, but before it was decided by the trial court, the Office of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner issued a letter ruling that the BPT is a tax imposed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As such, the ruling advised that Principal\u2019s payment of the BPT on its commercial realty business would trigger the imposition of an Iowa tax retaliation upon Pennsylvania companies doing insurance business in Iowa.\nAfter receiving briefs and hearing oral argument, on May 23, 2003, the trial court denied Principal\u2019s appeal and affirmed the Board. Thereafter, Principal appealed to this Court.\nOn appeal, Principal raises three issues. First, it contends that under the applicable statutory law, Principal\u2019s rental income from its real property investments is nontaxable \u201cbusiness of an insurance company.\u201d Second, it argues that the net income portion of the BPT should not have been imposed upon Principal, which is a regulated entity and, as such, is only subject to the gross receipts portion of the BPT. Finally, Principal contends that because it acted in good faith, and without negligence or intent to defraud, there was no basis for the Board\u2019s imposition of interest and penalties. We consider these issues seriatim.\nAPPLICABILITY OF THE BPT TO PRINCIPAL\u2019S RENTAL INCOME\nThe central issue in this appeal is the meaning of \u201cbusiness of an insurance company as used in the taxing ordinance and its enabling statute. Principal argues for a broad reading of the term that extends beyond the sale of its insurance products, such as insurance policies and retirement annuities. It explains that all insurers must invest them assets that have been accumulated by virtue of policyholder premium payments, and these investments are essential to the insurer\u2019s ability to meet its contractual obligations to policyholders. Accordingly, \u201cbusiness of an insurance company\u201d necessarily includes investment activities. The City counters that when Principal was operating two office buildings, it was doing the business of a landlord not of an insurer. Further, it argues that Principal\u2019s payment of the BPT on its realty revenue will not trigger a retaliatory tax in the State of Iowa. Both parties assert that this Court must decide the scope and meaning of the Iowa retaliatory tax statute in order to determine whether Principal has liability for the BPT.\nThe First Class City Business Tax Reform Act (1984 Act), Act of May 80, 1984, P.L. 345, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 16181-16193, authorizes the City to tax businesses. To that end, it defines \u201cbusiness\u201d as follows:\nCarrying on or exercising, for gain or profit, within a city of the first class, any trade, business, including financial business as hereinafter defined, profession, vocation or commercial activity or making sales to persons within such city of the first class.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 16182. Excluded from this definition, however, is the business of a foreign insurance company if its taxation will trigger the imposition of a retaliatory tax upon Pennsylvania insurers. Specifically, the 1984 Act states as follows:\n\u201cBusiness\u201d shall not include the following:\n(3) The business of any insurance company, association or exchange, or any fraternal, benefit or beneficial society of any other state under the laws of which insurance companies, associations or exchanges or fraternal, benefit or beneficial societies of this Commonwealth doing business in such other state are subjected, by reason of the tax imposed by this act, to additional or further taxes, fines, penalties or license fees by such other state.\nId. (emphasis added).\nIn support of its claim that the \u201cbusiness of any insurance company\u201d extends to rental income received from tenants of an office building, Principal directs our attention to the definition of \u201cReceipts\u201d in the 1984 Act, which provides in relevant part as follows:\nReceipts from a person engaged in the business of insurance shall also include receipts from rental real estate situated in cities of the first class but shall not include interest, dividend and capital gain receipts. Nothing in this definition shall preclude the taxation of other non-premium business receipts of persons engaged in the business of insurance.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 16182 (emphasis added). Principal reads the first sentence in the above-quoted provision to mean that \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d includes the operation of rental properties. Principal also believes that case law precedent supports this conclusion. The key cases relied upon by Principal are instructive and they warrant a close review.\nThe first case is Levis v. New York Life Insurance Company, 358 Pa. 57, 55 A.2d 801 (1947). At issue in Levis was whether a Pennsylvania statute, which authorized New York Insurance Company to own Pennsylvania realty, violated the Pennsylvania Constitution. In upholding the insurer\u2019s right to conduct this activity in Pennsylvania, our Supreme Court held as follows:\nIt is common knowledge that the life insurance business is necessarily concerned with innumerable transactions involving every conceivable kind of property and interest in property ...\nIt requires no argument to show that investment is an essential part of the business of a life insurance company and that the investment of such large sums requires a wide field of possible choice.\n358 Pa. at 61-62, 55 A.2d at 803 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\nPrincipal next directs our attention to this Court\u2019s recent holding in Executive Life Insurance Company v. Commonwealth, 147 Pa.Cmwlth. 105, 606 A.2d 1282 (1992). At issue in Executive Life was whether a foreign insurer\u2019s revenue from the sale of annuities in Pennsylvania should be used to calculate its Pennsylvania retaliatory tax. Because annuities are not considered to be a form of insurance in Pennsylvania, Executive Life claimed that its annuity sales were not relevant to its retaliatory tax. This Court disagreed. The purpose of the retaliatory tax is to level the playing field between insurers facing different taxing statutes from state to state. Because California taxed annuity revenue received by Pennsylvania companies from California annuity contract holders, annuity revenue was properly included in the calculation of Executive Life\u2019s Pennsylvania retaliatory tax. Accordingly, we upheld the Department of Revenue.\nPrincipal offers Levis and Executive Life as the standards for interpreting the 1984 Act. Levis teaches that the business of insurance includes \u201cevery conceivable kind of property and interest in property,\u201d and Principal\u2019s interests in the Broad Street and Walnut Street Properties are examples of such recognized interests. Executive Life directs a burden analysis to determine whether a tax will trigger out-of-state retaliation, and imposition of the BPT on Principal\u2019s rental income is a \u201cburden\u201d on its doing insurance business in Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the BPT will be properly considered by Iowa in trying to level the playing field for Iowa insurers through the retaliatory tax. This is a good argument, but it does not address completely the statutory construction challenge posed by the 1984 Act.\nThe origins and meaning of the statutory term \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d are well known. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015, was enacted by Congress to immunize state insurance regulatory statutes from federal preemption. It states:\nCongress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States.\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 (emphasis added). The term \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d has been the subject of extensive case law interpretation by the United States Supreme Court, and it has come to mean the relationship between a policyholder and insurer established in an insurance contract. See Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 102 S.Ct. 3002, 73 L.Ed.2d 647 (1982) (using peer review committees to evaluate reasonableness of chiropractic care found not to be the business of insurance). The McCarran-Ferguson Act did not establish a blanket immunization of state insurance regulatory laws from preemption. Rather, Congress provided that after June 30, 1948, the Sherman, Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts would be applicable to insurers unless the states regulated the business of insurance against the conduct proscribed by these antitrust laws. In response to this Congressional push, Pennsylvania enacted the Insurance Unfair Practices Act, Act of June 5, 1947, P.L. 445, 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1162, repealed and replaced by the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, Act of July 22, 1974, P.L. 589, 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1171.1-1171.15, to \u201cregulate trade practices in the business of insurance ....\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.2 (emphasis added). The focus of this state law is the issuance of insurance policies and contracts, their marketing and compliance \u25a0 with contractual obligations. Notably, the Unfair Insurance Practices Act is silent on insurance investment activities.\nWe return to Section 2 of the 1984 Act, which excludes the \u201cbusiness of an insurance company\u2019 from the BPT. 53 P.S. \u00a7 16182. It must be presumed that the Legislature used the term \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d advisedly. Where \u201ctechnical words and phrases ... have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d that meaning is to be given where those words are used in statute. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). Consistent with the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d in the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, the term as used in the 1984 Act signifies the business between the insurer and the policyholder. It does not include doing business as a commercial landlord, which is as attenuated from the insurer-policyholder relationship as is the merger of two insurance companies. Securities and Exchange Commission v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 89 S.Ct. 564, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969) (wherein it was held that insurance company mergers were subject to federal statute because they were not the \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d).\nHowever, the inquiry does not end here. Principal asserts that the focus should be on the entity, not the business, and Principal most assuredly is an insurance company. It is a fact that Iowa has promised to respond to Principal\u2019s payment of the BPT with a tax retaliation on Pennsylvania insurers, and Principal contends this fact is dispositive. Stated otherwise, under Principal\u2019s interpretation, whenever the BPT may trigger retaliation on a Pennsylvania insurer, the BPT cannot be imposed on a foreign insurer. We disagree.\nFirst, such a reading gives undue emphasis to one of the two conditions to the statutory exemption. The tax must be imposed on the \u201cbusiness of an insurance company\u201d and trigger retaliation before it can be avoided. Both conditions must be met to claim an exemption.\nSecond, Principal\u2019s interpretation is at odds with the statutory definition of \u201cReceipts,\u201d which clarifies that insurers collect \u201crental income.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 16182. However, the statute also states that \u201c[n]othing in this definition shall preclude the taxation of other nonpremium business receipts of persons engaged in the business of insurance.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). This expresses a legislative intention that rental income and \u201cother nonpremium business receipts\u201d may be taxed under the 1984 Act.\nFinally, the language of the 1984 Act authorizes taxation of business without regard to the legal form by which that business is conducted. The 1984 Act defines \u201cbusiness\u201d as \u201c[cjarrying on ... for gain or profit ... any trade, business, ... profession, vocation or commercial activity....\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 16182. A single corporation may conduct separate and discrete businesses and place them into divisions or departments of the corporation; alternatively, each business may be placed into a separate but affiliated corporation. In focusing on \u201cbusiness activity\u201d the 1984 Act does not allow the corporate or other form of organization to determine tax liability.\nWe agree with Principal\u2019s contention that its activities as a passive investor are exempt from the BPT. Indeed, this is reflected in the 1984 Act\u2019s definition of \u201cReceipts,\u201d which expressly exempts interest, dividends and capital gains from the BPT. So long as Principal\u2019s interest in the Broad Street and Walnut Street Properties was limited to collecting interest payments, its realty business was not subject to taxation. However, when Principal foreclosed on the two commercial properties, it crossed the line from passive to active investor. Principal\u2019s active business of owning and operating office buildings in the City for several years was not the \u201cbusiness of [an] insurance compan[y],\u201d and its receipts from this business are taxable under the 1984 Act.\nIn denying Principal\u2019s petition for abatement of the assessment, the Board made note of a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Gerber, 22 Ill.2d 196, 174 N.E.2d 862 (1961). In construing the applicable retaliatory tax statute, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that only those taxes paid by insurance companies as a condition to doing the business of insurance should be given credit. It reasoned as follows:\n[W]e think it clear that the legislature included within its scope only the taxes paid by insurance companies, as such, as a condition precedent to their doing business in the respective States. If it were not otherwise, and if plaintiffs theory was carried to its logical conclusions, the result would be a construction that State differences in such things as motor-vehicle fees, fuel tax and the like, required \u201cby other law(s) of this State,\u201d were intended to be included in the computation of the retaliatory tax.\nThe ad valorem tax on personal property is not assessed as a condition precedent to the doing of an insurance busi-\nness in either California or Illinois. Rather, the assessment of personal property in California is based upon the ownership, claim, possession, control or management of personal property... .Any foreign insurance company may own any amount of property in Illinois without doing business in the State, and the same is true with respect to Illinois companies and California. Such companies will pay no fee or tax for the privilege of doing business, but in each instance must pay property taxes on the property it owns.\nId. at 201-202, 174 N.E.2d at 865-866 (emphasis added). Thus, only those taxes paid by an insurer as a \u201ccondition precedent to their doing business\u201d were used in the computation of a retaliatory tax. Id.\nWe agree with the Pacific Life analysis. Principal did not need to be licensed as a foreign insurer in order to invest in the Broad Street and Walnut Street Properties. The \u201cbusiness of an insurance company\u201d cannot include every endeavor undertaken by an insurance company to support its core business of selling insurance products. This would lead to unjust and improper results. The BPT is used to fund the delivery of vital services, such as police and fire protection, that are needed by commercial landlords, including Principal, to operate their office buildings. There is no sound policy reason why the costs of these services should be transferred to other taxpayers; not even the promotion of Pennsylvania-domiciled insurers justifies such a result.\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court. We hold that Principal\u2019s receipts in the form of rental income from its commercial realty business are taxable under the 1984 Act.\nNET INCOME PORTION OF THE BPT\nPrincipal contends that even if this Court determines that the BPT was properly applied to Principal\u2019s rental income, the trial court still must be reversed. It asserts that the Board erred by including Principal\u2019s net income from operating its two buildings in its BPT assessment.\nThe Broad Street Property was taxed between 1993 and 1999, and the Walnut Street Property was taxed between 1994 and 1999. During that period, the rate of taxation changed, but the method of computation did not. In 1993, the applicable tax rate was stated as follows for regulated industries:\nEvery regulated industry shall pay an annual tax for the tax years 1990 and thereafter at the rate of three and one-quarter (3%) mills on each dollar of annual receipts thereof, provided, however, that the amount payable shall not exceed six and one-half percent (6/4%) of its net income.\nThe Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-2604(l)(d) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The Code also provided:\nEvery business other than regulated industries shall pay an annual tax for the tax years 1990 and thereafter at the rate of three and one-quarter (3/4) mills on each dollar of annual receipts thereof, and six and one-half percent (6/4%) of its net income....\nThe Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-2604(2)(d) (emphasis added). Thus, regulated industries have their taxation based solely upon gross receipts, which is capped at 6)4 % of their net income. Other businesses pay tax on both their gross receipts and their net income. A \u201cregulated industry\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] person subject to a tax pursuant to Articles VII, VIII, IX or XV of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 or any public utility_\u201d The Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-2601.\nBecause Principal is subject to the Pennsylvania premiums tax, it contends that it is \u201ca regulated industry,\u201d and, thus, should have been excused from the net income portion of the BPT. Principal further contends that in failing to apply the same BPT tax rates to Principal that are applied to other life insurance companies, the City has not only violated the BPT Ordinance, it has violated the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nFor the years in question, the City has assessed Principal $48,754 for the gross receipts portion of the BPT and $140,794 for the net income portion of the BPT, totaling $189,548 (Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20 and 22, R.R. 5a. and 6a). The City did not use Principal\u2019s premium income to calculate its BPT with respect to either portion of the BPT. Rather, the gross receipts used to calculate the BPT were those received from tenants of the Broad Street and Walnut Street Properties. In short, the City treated Principal\u2019s real estate business as separate and discrete from the insurance business on which Principal paid a premiums tax.\nThe trial court did not address this issue raised by Principal. The City suggests that the trial court did not rule on this aspect of Principal\u2019s appeal because Principal did not raise the issue in the hearing before the Board. The Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 753(a), provides that \u201cif a full and complete record of the proceedings before the agency was made such party may not raise upon appeal [to the trial court] any other question not raised before the agency....\u201d It is possible, as argued by the City, that the trial court believed that Principal\u2019s challenge to the net income portion of the BPT was not preserved. It is also possible that the trial court believed that Principal\u2019s commercial real estate operation was a division of a regulated industry but not itself a regulated industry. We decline to speculate on the trial court\u2019s reasons for not deciding the question.\n'in the absence of any decision by the trial court on Principal\u2019s challenge to the net income portion of the BPT, we do not rule on this issue of Principal. Instead, we remand the matter to the trial court for a decision.\nPENALTIES AND INTEREST\nInterest and penalties may be abated in whole or in part where the taxpayer has acted in good faith and without negligence and had no intent to defraud. The Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-1705(2). The Board, however, refused Principal an abatement, asserting that Principal was \u201creckless\u201d in its failure to file a BPT tax return without obtaining a ruling from the City.\nTo support its argument that it acted in good faith, Principal notes that in 1976, the City issued a ruling that investment income of an insurance company was excluded from the BPT under the Retaliatory Tax Exclusion, the same exclusion on which Principal relies. In 1992, in In Re: E/R Associates (Philadelphia Tax Review Board Opinion No. 92-C, January 6, 1992), R.R. 288a, the City stipulated and the Board held that rental income from real estate investments was considered to be income from \u201cinsurance business\u201d for purposes of establishing an exclusion from the BPT. Finally, Principal had never been required by any Pennsylvania municipality to pay a business privilege tax. This does appear to be a question of first impression.\nThe trial court held that Principal failed to make a record in support of its claim that it acted in good faith. However, that charge can also be levied at the City, which did not make a record in support of its claim that Principal acted \u201crecklessly.\u201d Indeed, it is not clear what record can be made where, as here, the taxpayer offers a reasonable legal position to explain why it did not file a BPT return.\nThis Court has held, and we do so here, that where a taxpayer has a meritorious legal position, interest and penalties should be abated. See Samuel Rappaport Ltd. Partnership v. Tax Review Board of the City of Philadelphia, 682 A.2d 862 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996) (holding where the taxpayer had a valid and meritorious position in taking an appeal, penalties assessed should be abated); Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. v. Hines, 337 Pa. 48, 10 A.2d 553 (1940) (holding that harsh penalties and unusual interest rates cannot be imposed, pending litigation intended to test the construction or validity of an act, so as to deter or intimidate parties affected thereby from resorting to the courts for that purpose). Under these circumstances, it was an abuse of discretion for the Board to impose penalties on Principal\u2019s unpaid principal amount of the BPT.\nIn Nine Penn Center Associates v. Tax Review Board of the City of Philadelphia, 692 A.2d 246 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997), we abated penalties, but not interest, where, as here, the taxpayer\u2019s legal challenge to the BPT was not frivolous. In that case, this Court found that the interest was reasonable. Here, the record shows that interest and penalties as of March 3, 2003, totaled $411,918, as compared to an underlying assessment of $189,548. We do not know what part of the $411,918 represents penalties and what part represents interest. Given this record, we cannot say whether the interest is reasonable or unreasonable. Principal presented a viable legal contest in a question of first impression, and the Board did not explain why that fact was not sufficient to support abatement of at least some of the interest. Instead, it simply offered its conclusory \u201copinion\u201d that Principal was \u201creckless\u201d without reference to the record.\nAccordingly, we remand for a determination of whether the interest imposed on Principal was unreasonable in light of the fact that Principal exercised its legal right to litigate a case of first impression.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above-stated reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part. We affirm the trial court\u2019s holding that the conduct of a commercial realty business is not the \u201cbusiness of an insurance company\u201d even if it will lead to tax retaliation by the State of Iowa against Pennsylvania insurers. We reverse the trial court\u2019s refusal to abate penalties. We remand Principal\u2019s challenge to the net income portion of the BPT and the issue of appropriate interest for a decision by the trial court. Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand this matter for further proceedings.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 22nd day of December, 2003, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County dated May 23, 2003, in the above-captioned matter is hereby vacated and the case remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the attached opinion.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\n. See Section 2 of the First Class City Business Tax Reform Act, Act of May 30, 1984, P.L. 345, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 16182, which exempts such business from the BPT.\n. The record was established before the Board by a joint stipulation of the parties.\n. The Iowa statute provides that:\nThe investment programs developed by companies shall take into account the safety of the company\u2019s principal, investment yield and return, stability in the value of the investment, and liquidity necessary to meet the company\u2019s expected business needs and investment diversification.\nIowa Code \u00a7 511.8. \u201cUrban real estate ... which produces income\u201d is specified as an acceptable investment. Id. at\u00a7 511.8(14).\n. Stipulation, \u00b6 19. Reproduced Record 5a (R.R. __). The amount was established by stipulation subject to a correction for computational errors.\n. See Principal Reply Brief at 22. The Stipulation identifies the interest and penalties as of January 23, 2002, as \"$126,777 and $219,399, respectively.\u201d R.R. 6a.\n. The March 28, 2003 letter was addressed to the Board and executed by James Armstrong, Deputy Insurance Commissioner for the State of Iowa (Iowa Letter Ruling). R.R. 296a. The City argues that the Iowa letter ruling has little significance. It contends that unless and until Iowa attempts to use the gross receipts tax to compute the retaliatory tax owed by a Pennsylvania company and that tax is not successfully challenged by a Pennsylvania company, the question of whether the BPT will trigger retaliation remains undecided.\n. The Iowa statute provides in relevant part as follows:\nWhen by the laws of any other state a premium or income or other taxes, or fees, fines, penalties, licenses, deposit requirements or other obligations, prohibitions or restrictions are imposed upon Iowa insurance companies actually doing business in the other state, or upon the agents of the Iowa companies, which in the aggregate are in excess of the aggregate of the taxes, fees, fines, penalties, licenses, deposit requirements or other obligations, prohibitions or restrictions directly imposed upon insurance companies of the other state under the statutes of this state, the same obligations, prohibitions or restrictions of whatever kind are in the same manner and for the same purpose imposed upon insurance companies of the other state doing business in Iowa.\nIowa Code \u00a7 505.14 (emphasis added).\nIn a retaliatory tax scheme, Iowa adopts Pennsylvania's tax burden as its own and imposes it upon the foreign insurer. The goal is to level the playing field for insurers that do business in states with varying tax schemes. The retaliatory tax equalizes taxes and raises revenues only incidentally. Accordingly, the retaliatory tax promotes interstate business of domestic insurers. Western & Southern Life Insurance Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 451 U.S. 648, 101 S.Ct. 2070, 68 L.Ed.2d 514 (1981) (wherein a retaliatory tax was found not to violate equal protection).\n. Principal contends that its payment of the BPT will trigger retaliation against Pennsylvania life insurers doing business in Iowa. The City responds that the fact that the Iowa Insurance Commissioner has pledged such a course of retaliatory action is of no moment. The real question is whether an Iowa appellate court will sustain the commissioner\u2019s action.\nAs noted by the City, the Iowa insurance retaliatory tax does not expressly include local taxes in the measure of relative burdens, and the retaliatory tax form promulgated by the State of Iowa does not instruct that local taxes, such as the BPT, be used in the calculation. R.R. 140a. The City also examines the practical problems Iowa would have in using the BPT to compute the retaliatory tax because it will require allocation of an Iowa insurer's business between Philadelphia and the rest of the Commonwealth. See, e.g., Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, 325 Mass. 386, 90 N.E.2d 668 (1950) (wherein it was held that assessments paid to the cities of Boston and Worcester for the prevention of fires was not a condition of doing business in Massachusetts but, rather, in two of its political subdivisions).\nBoth parties invite this Court to construe the Iowa retaliatory tax statute. We do not do so because it is not necessary to complete our task, which is to construe a Pennsylvania statute. Whether imposing the BPT on Principal\u2019s commercial realty business will result in retaliation by Iowa is not dispositive of this appeal.\n. These provisions appear word-for-word in the ordinance by which the City exercised its authority under the 1984 Act. The Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-2601 (7th Ed.1998). Since the ordinance cannot conflict with the 1984 Act, this opinion focuses on the 1984 Act rather than the ordinance. However, it goes without saying that our interpretation of the 1984 Act also interprets the ordinance.\n. Principal reads this provision to mean receipts \"of\u201d a person engaged in the business of insurance. Literally, \u201creceipts from\u201d suggests that it speaks to the landlords of insurance companies, foreign or domestic, who pay them rent. However, considering the statutory provision in its entirety, the better reading is that \"receipts from\u201d means \"receipts from ... the business of insurance.\u201d\n. Levis, 358 Pa. at 61, 55 A.2d at 803.\n. Where Pennsylvania insurers are under a \u201cgreater burden than California companies transacting business in Pennsylvania,\u201d then California insurers will pay a retaliatory tax to equalize the burden. Executive Life, 606 A.2d at 1284.\n. The McCarran-Ferguson Act was passed in response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, 322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944). The Supreme Court held that insurance fell within the parameters of the Commerce Clause and, thus, federal statutes, such as the federal antitrust laws, applied to insurance. The McCarran-Ferguson Act effectively safeguards state insurance regulation against preemption through the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine. Ruthardt v. United States, 303 F.3d 375, 380 (1st Cir.2002).\n.See also Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 99 S.Ct. 1067, 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979) (insurer's agreement with participating pharmacies to provide pharmacy benefits held not to be the business of insurance); SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 89 S.Ct. 564, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969) (state law regulating merger of insurers held not part of the business of insurance).\n. The McCarran-Ferguson Act provides in relevant part:\nProvided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law.\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b).\n. To be precise, the 1984 Act adds the word \"company\u201d to the phrase \"business of insurance.\u201d This addition is not of telling significance. Insurance agents, for example, do the business of insurance, but only insurance companies pay a premium tax or a retaliatory tax. \"Company\" has limiting, not expansive effect on the term \"business of insurance.\u201d In any case, \"business of insurance\u201d is the exact term used in the definition of \"Receipts.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 16182.\n. It is presumed that \"the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be effective and certain.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(2).\n. It is unlikely that in Levis, a 1947 case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court used the term \"business of insurance\u201d to signify the activity addressed in the McCarran-Ferguson Act. In any case, the 1984 Act does not prevent insurers, foreign or domestic, from investing in real property, which was the question in Levis. The question here is the extent to which such investments may be taxed.\n. Principal makes this claim with greater force in its challenge to the net income portion of the BPT.\n. Such a directive could have been expressed very simply; instead, we have a statutory provision byzantine in its choice of words and structure.\n. Some insurers may choose to operate their realty investments from an affiliate corporation, and the affiliate would be liable for the BPT because it could never be subject to an insurance retaliatory tax. There is no principled reason to favor insurers, which choose to operate their realty business from a division rather than from a separate corporation, by relieving them of the BPT.\n. During this time, Principal\u2019s mortgagors on the Broad Street and Walnut Street Properties would have had to pay the BPT on rental revenue received from leasing two buildings. Whether they actually paid the BPT is not known; however, the mortgagors certainly could not claim exemption because its mortgagee, Principal, was a foreign insurer.\n.The Board suggested that Principal should have sold the buildings immediately upon foreclosure. Principal correctly rejoins that it was necessary to operate the buildings, at least for a time, to protect their investment. A quick sale could have produced a fire sale price. Sound investment management is essential to payment of claims, as noted by our Supreme Court in Levis.\n. Pacific Life sought credit for the ad valo-rem. tax payments it made in the State of Illinois.\n. The obvious, of course, is the State premium tax. 72 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7902.\n. This analysis is consistent with that used in several jurisdictions. In Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Cooper, 81 N.Y.2d 50, 595 N.Y.S.2d 726, 611 N.E.2d 765 (1993), foreign insurers sought a credit against their New York retaliatory tax payments for payment of the New York City commercial rent tax. The New York Court of Appeals denied them this credit, holding that the tax was not imposed on the business of insurance, but, rather, imposed on all renters of commercial real estate in the city. The Court of Appeals reasoned that\nGiven the purpose of the retaliatory tax to promote interstate commerce by allowing both domestic and foreign insurers to compete on an equal basis and the absence of an express grant of a credit for the commercial rent tax, it would be inconsistent to read [New York Insurance Law] section 1112 as including payments made for the privilege of doing any business without regard to the nature of the business, such as the commercial rent tax at issue herein.\nId. at 54, 595 N.Y.S.2d 726, 611 N.E.2d at 767.\nIn Continental American Life Ins. Co. v. City of Wilmington, 273 A.2d 277 (Del.Super.1970), an insurer challenged a $200 license fee on an office building it owned, claiming that it would trigger retaliation against Delaware insurers. The court held, however, that the operation of real estate buildings did not constitute the \"business of insurance\u201d as that term is used in retaliatory tax statutes.\nPrincipal, in response, directs the Court to a number of cases where payment of local taxes could be used as a credit against payment of a retaliatory tax. See, e.g., Phoenix Home Life Mutual Ins. Co. v. Curiale, 162 Misc.2d 142, 615 N.Y.S.2d 967 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1994) (wherein a franchise tax on receipts and net income should be included in the retaliatory tax calculations); Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Bushnell, 97 Ariz. 18, 396 P.2d 253 (1964) (wherein the Arizona Supreme Court allowed a credit on ad valorem taxes paid to calculate the retaliatory tax owned by the foreign insurer).\n. Because we uphold the trial court, we need not reach the constitutional issues raised by the City.\n. In 1996, the millage was changed to 3 mills; and in 1997 to 2.95 mills; in 1998 to 2.875 mills; and in 1999 to 2.775 mills. The Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-2604(l)(e), (f), (g) and (h). The cap remained 6l/i% of net income.\n. In 1996, the rate changed to 3 mills; in 1997 to 2.95 mills; in 1998 to 2.875 mills; and in 1999 to 2.775 mills. The Philadelphia Code \u00a7 19-2604(2)(e), (f), (g) and (h). The net income tax rate remained 6 {4%.\n. The difference in tax rates between regulated and non-regulated businesses may be explained by the difference in revenue. Insurers, for example, have vast premium receipts, and to tax those revenues without a cap would result in excessive taxation. Of course, here the BPT was not applied to Principal\u2019s premium receipts. Theoretically, premium revenue of a foreign insurer could be taxable under the 1984 Act if imposition of the BPT would not lead to retaliation; this could happen where the premium tax in the other state was much higher than Pennsylvania\u2019s. In that case, the foreign insurer should be able to claim payment of the BPT as a credit towards its Pennsylvania retaliatory tax.\n. The Tax Reform Code of 1971, Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-10004, establishes a bank and trust company shares tax in Article VII (72 P.S. \u00a7 7701), a title insurance company shares tax in Article VIII (72 P.S. \u00a7 7801), an insurance premium tax in Article IX (72 P.S. \u00a7 7901), a utilities tax in Article XI (72 P.S. \u00a7 8101) and a mutual thrift institutions tax in Article XV (72 P.S. \u00a7 8501).\n. Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. VIII, \u00a7 1.\n. United States Constitution amend. XIV, \u00a7 1.\n. See Home Life Ins. Co. of America \u2014 Philadelphia Mercantile License Tax, Tax Ruling No. 76-1 (March 17, 1976), R.R. 289a.\n. The City disputes Principal\u2019s analysis of this holding. It contends that the holding concerned a partnership that included an insurance company as partner. The City stipulated for purposes of litigation that the partnership\u2019s payment of the BPT would trigger the New York retaliatory tax. However, the City claims there was no intention to establish precedent on the meaning of \"business of an insurance company.\u201d In any case, the City contends that this opinion was not binding on the City in subsequent actions.\n. In Nine Penn Center Associates v. Tax Review Board of the City of Philadelphia, 692 A.2d 246 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997), this Court followed Rappoport, stating that the Court must be wary of situations that might deter or intimidate parties from resorting to the courts to test the construction of an act.\n. In Dole v. City of Philadelphia, 337 Pa. 375, 11 A.2d 163 (1940), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that where the so-called default arises because of a bona fide contest, \"it would be inequitable to exact the penalties and interest in addition to the tax and for that reason they should not be recovered.\u201d Dole, 337 Pa. at 384, 11 A.2d at 168 (quoting Appeal of Fidelity\u2014Philadelphia Trust Co., 337 Pa. 34, 41, 10 A.2d 547, 550 (Pa.1939)).",
