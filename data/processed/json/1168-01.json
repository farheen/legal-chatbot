        "text": "DANA, J.\n[\u00b6 1] Pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 80C, Tsu-la Botting appeals from the judgment entered in the Superior Court (Kennebec County, Atwood, J.) affirming the Commissioner of the Department of Behavioral and Developmental Services\u2019s dismissal of her grievance. In her grievance, Botting alleged that she received inadequate care when she was a voluntary patient at the Aroostook Medical Center (TAMC) and that TAMC failed to obtain her informed consent before it treated her. She contends that the Superior Court erred in determining that BDS lacked authority to review her grievance and in finding that BDS\u2019s dismissal of her grievance did not violate her Fourteenth Amendment rights. Because we find that BDS had no supervisory authority over a nondesignated non-state mental health institution treating a voluntarily admitted patient and that Bot-ting has asserted no interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, we affirm the judgment.\nI. BACKGROUND\n[\u00b6 2] In May 1999, TAMC admitted Bot-ting voluntarily after she requested treatment following a suicide attempt. Thirteen days later, after treating her with a variety of prescription drugs, TAMC released Botting. Dissatisfied with her care, Botting filed a grievance with TAMC\u2019s Psychiatric Unit Manager pursuant to the Rights of Recipients of Mental Health Services (hereinafter the RRMHS regulations) set forth in the BDS regulations. See 13 C.M.R. 14 193 001-14 \u00a7 A(VII) (1995). Her grievance alleged that she had received inadequate care and that TAMC had failed to acquire her informed consent before treating her.\n[\u00b6 3] TAMC is a private institution; therefore, it is a \u201cnonstate mental health institution.\u201d Like all hospitals in Maine, the Maine Department of Human Services licenses it. However, unlike some non-state mental health institutions, it is not a \u201cdesignated nonstate mental health institution\u201d because it does not contract with BDS for the receipt of involuntary patients.\n[\u00b6 4] As a condition of DHS licensure, hospitals like TAMC are required to comply with the RRMHS regulations. See 13 C.M.R. 10 144 112-69 \u00a7 XXIII(F) (2003). DHS rules also provide that, under agreement with DHS, BDS shall conduct surveys and inspections for compliance with the RRMHS regulations, id., but vest BDS with no other-specific enforcement authority over individual grievances, see id. The RRMHS regulations purport to apply to, among other agencies, \u201call public or private inpatient psychiatric institutes and units.\u201d 13 C.M.R. 14 193 001-4, Introduction (1995).\n[\u00b6 5] In response to a grievance, the RRMHS regulations provide that first, the \u201csupervisor of the service delivery unit in which the grievance arises\u201d reviews the grievance. Id. at 001-16 \u00a7 A(VHXG)(9)(a)(i). That decision may then be reviewed by the chief administrative officer or the director of the Division of Mental Health or a designee. Id. at 001-17 \u00a7 A(VII)(G)(9)(b)(i). The RRMHS regulations then provide for a third level of review; the Commissioner of BDS or the Commissioner\u2019s designee may review the grievance. Id. at 001-18 \u00a7 A(VII)(G)(9)(c)(i). Whether the Legislature intended level three to apply to non-designated nonstate mental health institutions is the subject of this dispute.\n[\u00b6 6] Botting proceeded through the first and second levels of the grievance process and attempted level three. At level three, the Commissioner referred her grievance to the Division of Administrative Hearings, which assigned the case to the chief administrative hearing officer for a hearing. After a February 2001 hearing, the chief administrative hearing officer issued a recommended decision in which he found that TAMC had failed to obtain Botting\u2019s informed consent prior to administering treatment, but that TAMC had not provided inadequate care. Additionally, he issued a recommended order requiring TAMC to develop new policies concerning informed consent and to comply with them.\n[\u00b6 7] Upon review of the recommended decision, however, the Commissioner issued a final order dismissing Botting\u2019s grievance because she determined that BDS had no licensing authority over institutions like TAMC; therefore, it had no authority to review Botting\u2019s grievance. The Commissioner\u2019s final order provided:\nTAMC is a healthcare facility licensed by the Maine Department of Human Services (\u201cDHS\u201d). Although the DHS rules for hospital licensure require that hospitals with psychiatric units comply with the \u201cRights of Recipients\u201d, the [Department of Behavioral and Developmental Services] has no licensing authority relating to such facilities. While [BDS] may, under agreement with DHS, carry out surveys and inspections for compliance with the \u201cRights of Recipients\u201d, licensing determinations regarding alleged violations of the \u201cRights of Recipients\u201d are a function of DHS\u2019 licensing authority (See, 10-144 CMR, Chapter 112, Section XXIII.F).\nBDS concluded that DHS had licensing authority, so the Commissioner dismissed Botting\u2019s grievance and referred it to DHS for further action.\n[118] Botting appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 80C and 5 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 11001 (2002). Giving deference to BDS\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute establishing its authority, the court affirmed BDS\u2019s order. It found reasonable BDS\u2019s conclusion that the procedural right to the grievance process did not apply to private patients because DHS licensing authority, not BDS enforcement, provided the only mechanism to enforce those rights. Furthermore, it found no due process violation. This appeal followed.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review and Rules of Construction\n[\u00b6 9] We review an agency decision, appealed from the Superior Court acting as an appellate court, \u201cdirectly for abuse of discretion, errors of law, or findings not supported by the evidence.\u201d Centamore v. Dep\u2019t of Human Sens., 664 A.2d 369, 370 (Me.1995). Here, where the question is one of statutory interpretation we review for errors of law. See Daniels v. Tew Mac Aero Servs., Inc., 675 A.2d 984, 987 (Me.1996). Unless the meaning of a statute is clear or within our own expertise, we will defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers when the agency\u2019s interpretation is both reasonable and within the agency\u2019s own expertise. See Guilford Transp. Indus. v. PUC, 2000 ME 31, \u00b6\u00b6 6-11, 746 A.2d 910, 912-13; Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Therefore, when the statute is unclear and it is within the agency\u2019s expertise, we \u201c \u2018limit our review to determining whether the agency\u2019s conclusions are unreasonable, unjust or unlawful in light of the record.\u2019 \u201d Guilford Transp. Indus., 2000 ME 31, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11, 746 A.2d at 912 (quoting Pine Tree Tel. & Tel. Co. v. PUC, 634 A.2d 1302, 1304 (Me.1993)).\n[\u00b6 10] When interpreting a statute, we first examine the plain meaning of the statutory language, striving to give effect to the legislative intent. Daniels, 675 A.2d at 987. In doing so, we consider the entire statutory scheme, so that a harmonious result may be achieved. Id. If the plain meaning of the statute is clear, we need investigate no further.\nB. Legislative Intent\n[\u00b6 11] In support of her assertion that the Legislature clearly intended all psychiatric patients to have the right to level three grievance review, regardless of where patients are treated, Botting points to eight subsections of title 34-B: sections 1203(4), 3003(1), 3003(2)(C), 3003(2)00, 3801(6), 3802(1), 3802(4), and 3870(1). Interpreting the same sections, BDS concludes that it does not have authority to conduct level three of the grievance process when the treatment facility is a non-designated nonstate mental health institution. Essentially, the parties disagree on whether Botting was a \u201cclient\u201d of BDS, and whether BDS has authority over TAMC pursuant to its authority set forth in subchapter IV of title 34-B. We are not persuaded that BDS\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers is unreasonable, unjust, or unlawful.\n[\u00b6 12] Through subsection 3003(1), the Legislature directed the Commissioner of BDS to adopt rules \u201cfor the enhancement and protection of the rights of clients receiving services from the department, from any hospital pursuant to subchapter IV ... or from any program or facility administered or licensed by the department under section 1203-A.\u201d 34-B M.R.S.A. \u00a7 3003(1) (Pamph. 2003) (emphasis added). According to section 3003(2)(C), the rules must include standards for informed consent, id. \u00a7 3003(2)(C) (1988), and according to 3003(2)(K), \u201c[provisions for a fair, timely and impartial grievance procedure for the purpose of ensuring appropriate administrative resolution of grievances with respect to infringement of rights,\u201d id. \u00a7 3003(2)(C), (K) (1988). Botting contends that she is a \u201cclient\u201d of BDS and received services from TAMC pursuant to subchap-ter IV; therefore, those rights apply to TAMC entitling her to level three of the grievance procedure.\n[\u00b6 13] The Legislature, however, provided a very specific definition of \u201cclient\u201d in subsection 1001(2). The parties disagree as to whether Botting was receiving services from \u201cany agency licensed or funded to provide services falling under the jurisdiction of the department.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1001(2) (Pamph. 2003). Although TAMC is not licensed or funded by BDS, Botting asserts that by virtue of its DHS licensing, TAMC is an agency licensed to provide services falling under the jurisdiction of BDS. Although this is a possible interpretation of the definition of \u201cclient,\u201d it is not the only possible interpretation, and it is not the one advanced by BDS. It is reasonable to interpret the definition, as BDS does, to limit \u201cclients\u201d to those people who receive services from agencies who are licensed or funded by BDS to provide services falling under its jurisdiction, like certain out-patient mental health treatment agencies. This definition excludes Bot-ting because she was a voluntary patient at a nondesignated nonstate mental health institution that is not licensed or funded by BDS. Botting was not receiving services from BDS or from any state institution. Our analysis of the reasonableness of this interpretation, however, would be incomplete without examining the related provisions in title 34-B to determine whether such an interpretation is in harmony with the entire statutory scheme.\n[\u00b6 14] Botting maintains that TAMC is subject to the rules BDS adopted pursuant to subsection 3003(1) because subsection 3003(1) applies to clients who receive \u201cservices from ... any hospital pursuant to subchapter IV.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3003(1) (emphasis added). She asserts that subchapter IV creates a broad supervisory authority for the Commissioner over state and nonstate, designated and nondesignated institutions, including TAMC. However, BDS reasonably reads subchapter IV as creating a narrower authority, permitting the Commissioner to create substantive patient rights, including a grievance process, but not authorizing the Commissioner to review the results of grievance procedures conducted at nondesignated nonstate mental health institutions.\n[\u00b6 15] Nothing in subchapter IV renders BDS\u2019s interpretation of the scope of its authority unreasonable. Subchapter TV, titled \u201cHospitalization,\u201d permits the Commissioner to \u201c[promulgate such rules, not inconsistent with this subchapter, as [s]he may find to be reasonably necessary for proper and efficient hospitalization of the mentally ill.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3802(1) (1988). It contains definitions of \u201cnonstate mental health institution,\u201d id. \u00a7 3801(6), \u201cstate mental health institute,\u201d id. \u00a7 3801(9), and subsequently a definition of a \u201cdesignated non-state mental health institution,\u201d id. \u00a7 3801(1-A) (Pamph. 2003). In addition to the power to adopt rules for hospitalization, subchapter IV also provides the Commissioner with the power to investigate complaints, visit, require reports, and prescribe forms for any hospital to ensure conformity with the rules. Id. \u00a7 3802(2)-(5) (1988). It is reasonable, as BDS did, to interpret subchapter IV as applying to all mental health institutions and permitting the Commissioner to create substantive rights for all patients at all mental health institutions, but as not providing the Commissioner with authority to review grievances and enforce those rules at nondesig-nated nonstate mental health institutions when the grievance concerns a voluntarily admitted patient.\n[\u00b6 16] In contrast to section 3003(2)(K), in subchapter IV, the Legislature did not direct the Commissioner to create a grievance process for voluntary patients at non-designated nonstate mental health institutions. That the Legislature granted the Commissioner specific powers in reference to all mental health institutions and chose not to include the authority to create a grievance process, much less any enforcement authority, suggests that the Legislature did not intend to create a procedural right to a Commissioner-level review of grievances at nonstate nondesignated mental health institutions for voluntarily admitted patients. Therefore, it is reasonable for BDS to interpret subchapter IV as establishing a limited supervisory authority exercised through the specific powers granted. Because subchapter IV does not create a broad supervisory power and TAMC does not fall under a broad Departmental jurisdiction, BDS reasonably concluded that the definition of \u201cclient\u201d excludes Botting.\n[\u00b6 17] Botting also finds evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent to subject nondesig-nated nonstate mental health institutions to Commissioner review of grievances in section 3870(1) of subchapter IV. That section, dealing with \u201cconvalescent status,\u201d requires chief administrative officers of nonstate mental health institutions to obtain Commissioner approval subject to a plan for continued responsibility before releasing involuntarily committed patients. Id. section 3870(1) (Pamph. 2003). Contrary to Botting\u2019s contention, section 3870(1) does not evidence a clear intent to provide the Commissioner with broad supervisory authority over nonstate nonde-signated mental health institutions. The plain language of section 3870(1) supports BDS\u2019s interpretation that section 3870(1) only provides BDS a limited authority to ensure that involuntarily admitted patients are properly released into the community with plans for continued responsibility. Given that involuntarily committed patients are hospitalized subject to the state\u2019s authority, id. \u00a7\u00a7 3862-3866 (1988 & Pamph. 2003), it is entirely sensible for the Legislature to provide the Commissioner with authority to ensure that such a patient\u2019s release does not present a risk of harm to the patient or the community. However, it cannot be inferred from the plain language of section 3870(1) that the Legislature intended a broader grant of authority over voluntary patients at non-state nondesignated mental health institutions.\n[\u00b6 18] Botting also suggests that subsection 1203(4) indicates that the Legislature intended BDS to broadly supervise and enforce mental health treatment at all Maine mental health institutions. However, section 1203(4), which directs the Commissioner \u201cto establish procedures for hearing grievances of clients,\u201d id. \u00a7 1203(4) (Pamph. 2003) (emphasis added), like section 3003(1), is subject to the definition of \u201cclient,\u201d which may be reasonably interpreted as excluding Botting. Moreover, read in context, subsection 1203(4), does not apply to nondesignated nonstate mental health institutions because section 1203 as a whole describes the duties of the Commissioner with respect to state institutions.\n[\u00b6 19] Finally, Botting concludes that BDS\u2019s interpretation of its own authority leads to unreasonable and illogical results because patients who are admitted voluntarily may be held against their will pending assessment for involuntary admission pursuant to section 3862. Id. \u00a7 3862. See also \u00a7\u00a7 3832(1), 3863 (1988 & Pamph. 2003). Therefore, she reasons that the Legislature intended to give BDS broad authority over nondesignated nonstate mental health institutions to balance the \u201cenormous authority the legislature allows private institutions to exercise.\u201d Whether level three applies to voluntary patients held pending assessment for involuntary admission is not the issue presented by this case and we decline to infer any broad authority from Botting\u2019s assertion.\n[\u00b6 20] When interpreting statutes, we \u201c\u2018seek to discern from the plain language the real purpose of the legislation, avoiding results that are absurd, inconsistent, unreasonable, or illogical.\u2019 \u201d Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Bd. of Envtl. Prot, 629 A.2d 597, 599-600 (Me.1993) (quoting Mahaney v. State, 610 A.2d 738, 741 (Me.1992)). If BDS\u2019s interpretation foreclosed any meaningful review and redress for psychiatric patients whether voluntary or involuntary when admitted to nondesignated nonstate mental health institutions, then BDS\u2019s interpretation might be unreasonable. Bot-ting, however, and others like her, are not deprived of meaningful judicial review and the right to a remedy because she is not foreclosed from filing suit against TAMC to remedy her potential injury.\n[\u00b6 21] We conclude that BDS\u2019s interpretation that it has no statutory authority to review the results of the grievance process at nondesignated nonstate mental health institutions when initiated by voluntarily admitted patients is reasonable. We note that this conclusion is consistent with our decision in Geary v. Dep\u2019t of Behavioral and Developmental Services, 2003 ME 151, 838 A.2d 1162, where we also upheld BDS\u2019s interpretation of the limits of the scope of its authority over nonstate mental health institutions, as BDS had no authority to provide the remedy sought, namely level three review, where a grievance sought no available relief against BDS and was deemed to be without apparent merit at level two.\nC. Fourteenth Amendment Rights\n[\u00b6 22] Botting contends that access to level three of the grievance process is an interest created by the State and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Maine Constitution, article I, section 6-A. The Commissioner\u2019s denial of access to the process, maintains Botting, violates her right to due process. We disagree.\n[\u00b6 23] The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Maine Constitution, article I, section 6-A protect individuals from deprivations of life, liberty, or property by the State without due process of law. U.S. CONST, amend. XIV \u00a7 1; ME. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 6-A. See also ME. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 19 (providing a right to redress for injuries). To find a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, therefore, there must be (1) state action; (2) a deprivation of a life, liberty, or property interest; and (3) inadequate process. Botting simply asserts that the grievance process itself is a protectable interest. The interest in procedure itself is not an interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, Jackson v. Town of Searsport, 456 A.2d 852, 858 (Me.1983); Davila-Lopes v. Zapata, 111 F.3d 192, 195 (1st Cir.1997), or the Maine Constitution, article I, section 6-A, see Cent. Me. Power Co. v. PUC, 1999 ME 119, \u00b624 n. 12, 734 A.2d 1120, 1131 (\u201cThe equal protection guarantees of these provisions are coextensive.\u201d). Without a deprivation of a protected interest, Botting\u2019s due process argument fails.\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\n. The RRMHS regulations are a set of rules promulgated by BDS pursuant to its authority set forth in 34-B M.R.S.A. \u00a7 3003 (1988 & Pamph. 2003).\n. A \"nonstate mental health institution\u201d is \u201ca public institution, a private institution or a mental health center, which is administered by an entity other than the State and which is equipped to provide inpatient care and treatment for the mentally ill.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3801(6) (1988). In contrast, a \"state mental health institute\u201d is \u201cthe Augusta Mental Health Institute or the Bangor Mental Health Institute.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3801(9). Although there was no evidence at the grievance proceeding or findings that TAMC is or is not a designated nonstate mental health institution, Botting expressly does not dispute BDS\u2019s representation that it is a nondesignated nonstate mental health institution.\n. A \"designated nonstate mental health institution\u201d is a \"nonstate mental health institution that is under contract with [the Department of Behavioral and Developmental Services] for receipt by the hospital of involuntary patients.\" Id. \u00a7 3801(1-A) (Pamph. 2003).\n. During this litigation, BDS's name changed from the \u201cDepartment of Mental Health Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services\u201d to the \"Department of Behavioral and Developmental Services.\u201d\n. Subsection 1203(4) provides,\n4. Grievance procedures. The commissioner shall establish procedures for hearing grievances of clients. The procedures must include the opportunity for a timely hearing before a state hearing examiner or an independent fair hearing examiner. The commissioner may contract for the services of the hearing examiner or examiners, who shall conduct ... all adjudicatory proceedings pursuant to the Maine Administrative Procedure Act and who may not be employees of the Department of Behavioral and Developmental Services.\nId. \u00a7 1203(4).\n. Section 3003 provides in pertinent part,\n1. Promulgation. The commissioner shall adopt rules, subject to the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, Title 5, chapter 375, ... for the enhancement and protection of the rights of clients receiving services from the department, from any hospital pursuant to subchapter IV ... or from any program or facility administered or licensed by the department under section 1203-A.\n2. Requirements. The rules shall include, but are not limited to:\nC. Standards for informed consent to treatment, including reasonable standards and procedural mechanisms for determining when to treat a client absent his informed consent, consistent with applicable law;\nK. Provisions for a fair, timely and impartial grievance procedure for the purpose of ensuring appropriate administrative resolution of grievances with respect to infringement of rights;\nId. \u00a7 3003 (1988 & Pamph. 2003).\n. Subsection 3801(6) provides,\n6. Nonstate Mental Health Institution. \u201cNonstate mental health institution\u201d means a public institution, a private institution or a mental health center, which is administered by an entity other than the State and which is equipped to provide inpatient care and treatment for the mentally ill.\nId. \u00a7 3801(6) (1988).\n. Section 3802 provides in pertinent part,\nThe commissioner may:\n1. Rules. Promulgate such rules, not inconsistent with this subchapter, as he may find to be reasonably necessary for proper and efficient hospitalization of the mentally ill;\n4. Reports. Require reports from the chief administrative officer of any hospital or residential care facility relating to the admission, examination, diagnosis, release or discharge of any patient;\nId. \u00a7 3802.\n. Section 3870(1) provides,\n1. Authority. The chief administrative officer of a state mental health institute may release an improved patient on convalescent status when the chief administrative officer believes that the release is in the best interest of the patient and that the patient does not pose a likelihood of serious harm. The chief administrative officer of a non-state mental health institute may release an improved patient on convalescent status when the chief administrative officer believes that the release is in the best interest of the patient, the patient does not pose a likelihood of serious harm and, when releasing an involuntarily committed patient, the chief administrative officer has obtained the approval of the commissioner after submitting a plan for continued responsibility.\nId. \u00a7 3870(1) (Pamph. 2003).\n. According to section 1001(2), \"client\u201d means \"a person receiving services from the department [BDS], from any state institution or from any agency licensed or funded to provide services falling under the jurisdiction of the department [BDS].\u201d Id. \u00a7 1001(2).\n. We note that the Legislature\u2019s reference when defining \"client\u201d in section 1001(2) to \"any agency licensed or funded to provide services falling under the jurisdiction of the department,\u201d could be reasonably read to refer to those agencies, defined and described in section 3601(1), which BDS licenses and funds for the provision of \"mental health services\u201d meaning \"out-patient counseling, other psychological, psychiatric, diagnostic or therapeutic services and other allied services.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3601(2) (1988). TAMC is not an agency licensed or funded to provide such services.\n. Botting also contends that the fact that the RRMHS regulations purport to apply to \u201call public or private psychiatric institutes\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended BDS to have broad supervisory authority over all mental health institutions. The RRMHS regulations, however, are a set of rules promulgated by BDS and are not necessarily evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent. To the extent BDS exceeded its grant of authority when adopting certain provisions of the RRMHS regulations, those provisions are invalid.\n. We note that Botting has not argued that she was deprived of her liberty interest in refusing medical treatment, see Cruzan v. Dir. Mo. Dep\u2019t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990); therefore, we do not address such an argument.",
