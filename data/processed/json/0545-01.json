        "text": "WEATHERBEE, Justice.\nThe two Defendants claim title ownership of the four lots of land in issue by virtue of deeds to their predecessors in title from the Town of Poland which the Defendants contend acquired title through the foreclosure of liens placed on the property for unpaid taxes assessed in the years 1961, 1962 and 1964. The Plaintiff, who has the record title to three of the lots of land except for the effect of these tax liens, brings these two real actions to recover the property. The Plaintiff\u2019s only title to the fourth lot, the Philip Winslow lot, had been acquired by virtue of a quitclaim deed, dated April 28, 1964, from the Town of Poland, similar to those given by the Town to the Defendants\u2019 predecessors in title to the four lots. The facts in the two cases are essentially parallel and the legal issues are identical. The Justice in the Superior Court gave the Plaintiff judgment for possession of the land in question and the matter comes before us on the Defendants\u2019 consolidated appeals.\nWe find that the issue of validity of the appointment of the Town Manager as Tax Collector for the years 1961, 1962 and 1964 proves determinative of both appeals.\nAfter hearing on the two consolidated cases the Single Justice found that:\n\u201c7. The Town Manager of Poland, who served in that capacity during all of the years in question, was first appointed March 30, 1959, and his one-year contract of that date provided he should exercise the duties of Town Treasurer and Tax Collector.\n8. The procedure for annual reappointment of the Poland Town Manager, in 1960 and in all subsequent years through 1966, kept in each instance to the following pattern: After the close of a formal Selectmen\u2019s Meeting, and in the absence of the Town Manager, the Selectmen informally discussed renewal of his contract. Thereafter at a formal Selectmen\u2019s meeting there was a motion and vote to reappoint the manager, making no mention of the offices of Treasurer or Tax Collector; and a new or renewal contract was prepared and signed by the Selectmen and the Manager, again making no--mention of the offices of Treasurer or Tax Collector.\n9. The evidence clearly establishes that the Selectmen, Manager and townspeople all considered the Manager to be the Town Treasurer and Tax Collector, and that he acted in both of said capacities de facto; but the evidence also establishes that he did not hold either office de jure.\u201d\nAs we have frequently held, title acquired by virtue of a tax lien is a nullity unless all conditions precedent to its foreclosure have been complied with. The law protects the delinquent taxpayer from forfeiture of his property except under strict construction of statutory requirements. Arsenault v. Inhabitants of the Town of Roxbury, Me., 275 A.2d 598 (1971).\nThe Defendants, relying upon the foreclosure of the tax lien mortgages and the expiration of the periods of redemption, have the benefit of the statutory principle that the tax lien mortgage is\n\u201c . . . prima facie evidence in all courts in all proceedings by and against the municipality, its successors and assigns, of the truth of the statements therein and after the period of redemption has expired, of the title of the municipality to the real estate therein described, and of the regularity and validity of all proceedings with reference to the acquisition of title by such tax lien mortgage and the foreclosure thereof.\u201d\nAt this point, we should note that the Selectmen\u2019s appointment of the Manager as Treasurer had no validity. During the entire period in question the provisions of R.S.1954, Chap. 91, \u00a7 15 and later of 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2055 required that the Treasurer be elected by ballot at the annual town meeting and this office was not at that time one which the Selectmen could fill by appointment.\nAlthough it is clear that the Manager was not legally appointed to serve as Treasurer we see little value in discussing the issue of whether a Treasurer\u2019s duties are such as to affect the validity of tax liens as we consider that the qualifications of the Tax Collector are critical as to this issue. The Tax Collector is the sole officer authorized by the statute to sign and record in the Registry of Deeds the tax lien certificate, to file the copies of the certificates in the Treasurer\u2019s office, and to send notices to the record holders of mortgages.\nIt was held by this Court in Payson v. Hall, 30 Me. 319 (1849), and reiterated in Baker v. Webber, 102 Me. 414, 67 A. 144 (1907), that the effectiveness of a tax deed executed by a Tax Collector depended upon proof that the Collector has been legally elected to the office.\n\u201cThe party is required to produce the collector\u2019s deed not the deed of a person assuming without right to act in that capacity.\u201d Payson v. Hall, supra, 30 Me. at 326. (Emphasis added.)\nWhile these cases dealt with earlier methods of enforcing tax collection there can be little doubt that equally persuasive reasons for proof of qualifications of the Tax Collector are present when the ownership in issue is dependent upon a title obtained under automatic foreclosure of tax lien mortgages which no one but a Tax Collector de jure may execute. A valid appointment of a Tax Collector is crucial to the viability of his tax liens.\nThe Plaintiff, in light of the statutory declaration of prima facie proof of regularity, has the burden of demonstrating that the appointment of the Manager as Tax Collector did not comply with legal requirements, as she has raised this issue.\nThe authority for appointment of a Town Manager to other town offices at the times concerned with the 1961 and 1962 taxes is found in P.L. 1957, Chap. 405, \u00a7 41 which became R.S.1954, Chap. 90-A, \u00a7 41, and reads:\n\u201cSec. 41. Town manager form of government. A town may adopt the town manager form of government at a meeting held at least 60 days before the annual meeting.\nT. At the time of adoption, the town may determine which offices the manager is to hold, or may delegate that power to the selectmen.\nA. A manager may not be a moderator, selectman, assessor or member of the school committee.\nB. When a town had determined the offices which its manager is to hold, the selectmen shall appoint him annually to each of those offices.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nIn 1961 and 1962 it was voted at the annual town meeting that the Manager should hold the offices of Treasurer and Tax Collector and it thus became the duty of the Selectmen, when engaging a Manager, to appoint him to these offices also. In 1963 this statute was amended to state that the Selectmen, independently of the town meeting, shall determine what other offices the Manager shall hold.\nThe Defendants attack the Justice\u2019s conclusion that the Town Manager did not hold these offices de jure. They point out that when in 1959 the town adopted the Town Manager form of government this Town Manager\u2019s original written contract stipulated that the Manager should exercise the duties of Town Treasurer and Tax Collector. They argue that each annual decision by the Selectmen to continue the same Manager\u2019s employment as Manager constituted an appointment to those other offices also.\nAlthough the testimony \u2014 and, at least one of the minutes \u2014 speak of a successive Manager\u2019s contract as a \u201crenewal\u201d, none of these annual renewals of the Manager\u2019s contracts mention the office of Tax Collector and the original minutes of the Selectmen\u2019s meetings are silent as to any appointments of Tax Collector after 1959.\nThe testimony shows that the Selectmen\u2019s annual agreements with the Manager that he should also hold the office of Tax Collector were arrived at very informally. Witnesses testified that there was \u201ca lengthy discussion\u201d about it, that the Selectmen so \u201cmutually agreed\u201d, and that \u201cit was the understanding\u201d. The Town Manager testified \u201cit was my understanding that when this [1961] contract was signed it was a renewal [of the original contract]\u201d.\nThe testimony of the witnesses as to this is exemplified by this passage during direct examination of Mr. Fernald, a Selectman:\n\u201cA It had been the generally accepted practice that while the Selectmen were discussing the town manager\u2019s contract the town manager was absent, because we felt that it was better when he wasn\u2019t there, and his duties were discussed and the 1960 contract was renewed, the 1959 contract.\nWe discussed the different duties he was to perform. We discussed his ability as to each, and came to the agreement, and this was at a Selectmen\u2019s meeting when, at that time, no minutes of those meetings were kept. They were special meetings. And the town manager was advised the following day that we had signed his contract.\nQ Was it specifically determined that the town manager was to serve as tax collector, treasurer, road commissioner, overseer of the poor in 1960 ?\nA In discussing the contract, yes. We renewed his contract on the previous year\u2019s contract to perform those duties.\nQ And you were one of the signers of the 1960 contract ?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ When it was signed it was specifically understood, although not contained in the contract, that he was to serve as tax collector, treasurer, road commissioner and overseer of the poor ?\nA That is right, sir.\u201d\nMore than six years later, on July 29, 1969, the Secretary of the Board of Selectmen purported to amend the minutes by adding:\n\u201cI, R. A. Waterhouse, Jr., under oath, hereby amend the record of the Selectmen\u2019s Meeting of the Town of Poland held March 19, 1963 by adding the following omission therefrom:\n\u2018Voted, that Raymond F. Parsons is appointed tax collector, treasurer, road commissioner and overseer of the poor for the Town of Poland for the year April 1, 1963 to March 31, 1964.\u2019 \u201d\nA similar amendment was added at the same time for each year now in issue.\nWe are of the opinion that these late amendments \u2014 however well intended\u2014 cannot destroy the intervening rights of owners of affected properties. Moreover, they do not purport to show that the appointments of the Collector during the years in question were made in writing \u2014 a statutory requirement which none of the rest of the evidence has been able to supply.\nP.L.1957, Chap. 405, \u00a7 36 subd. II is explicit in its demands for formality of appointment of town officials:\n\u201cThe appointment of any town official or deputy shall be in writing and shall be signed by the appointing party.\u201d\nIn construing a statute as being mandatory or directory the purposes of the statute as well as the language must be considered. It has been considered by most jurisdictions that the word \u201cshall\u201d should be construed as imperative and mandatory and not merely directory and permissive. Barnes v. State ex rel. Pinkney, 236 Md. 564, 204 A.2d 787 (1964); North Hampton Racing & Breeding Ass\u2019n., Inc. v. Conway, 94 N.H. 156, 48 A.2d 472 (1946); Harvey v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Essex County, 30 N.J. 381, 153 A.2d 10 (1959); 50 Am.Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 28; 82C.J.S. Statutes \u00a7 380.\nIn our opinion the language of this statute lends itself to a logical mandatory interpretation. The Legislature recognized the necessity of having permanent records each year as to who was holding the various town offices. Persons dealing with town officials needed to know with assurance the identity of the person authorized to act. The Legislature, aware of the frailties of human memory and the possibilities of misinterpretation of official actions taken orally and informally, determined that the purpose of certainty could best be met by requiring written appointments to town offices. We conclude that the language \u201cshall be in writing\u201d is a \u201cmatter of substance\u201d and not a \u201cmatter of convenience\u201d and that the consequences that result from construing the language as mandatory are reasonably anticipated to promote the purposes of the statute. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local 145 v. Shapiro et al., 138 Conn. 57, 82 A.2d 345 (1951).\nWe have concluded that the tax lien mortgages in question were invalid unless the Tax Collector held the office de jure during 1961, 1962 or 1964 and that he did not hold the office unless his appointment was in writing. The statute has made the filing of the tax lien mortgage prima facie proof of the regularity of all prior proceedings necessary to its validity including, of course, the proper appointment of the Tax Collector. Inhabitants of Town of Lincolnville v. Perry, 150 Me. 113, 104 A.2d 884 (1954).\n\u201c. . . [P]rima facie evidence in legal intendendment means evidence which if unrebutted or unexplained is sufficient to maintain the proposition, and warrant the conclusion to support which it [has been] introduced . . .\u201d Carroll v. Boston Elevated Railway Co., 200 Mass. 527, 86 N.E. 793, 797 (1909).\nWhile no witness testified specifically that there were no written appointments of the Tax Collector, no written appointments were offered and the witnesses described at length the manner in which the Selectmen had informally and verbally decided that the Manager should serve as Tax Collector and that the Manager \u201cwas advised the next day that we had signed his contract [i. e. his contract as Manager]\u201d. From the abundance of testimony as to the manner in which the appointment was made, an inference could be drawn that there was no appointment in writing, thus overcoming the statutory prima facie proof of regularity.\nWhile the Single Justice made no specific finding that the appointments of the Tax Collector were not in writing, he found that the procedures followed by the Selectmen fell short of constituting valid appointments to that office. This finding was not clearly erroneous.\nThere was no error in the Justice\u2019s conclusion that the Plaintiff was entitled to judgment for possession of the land described in her complaint against the Defendant Ralph L. Poland, Sr. which is Docket No. 4119 or in his finding that the Plaintiff was entitled to judgment for possession of the first parcel of land described in her complaint against the Defendant Robert D. Merrill which is Docket No. 4118.\nA different situation prevails, however, in the Plaintiff\u2019s claim against Mr. Merrill for possession of the so-called Philip Winslow lot, the second parcel described in the complaint which is Docket No. 4118.\nIn order to be entitled to judgment for possession of this parcel the Plaintiff must prove the title she has alleged. Dolloff v. Gardiner, 148 Me. 176, 91 A.2d 320 (1952); Wyman v. Porter, 108 Me. 110, 79 A. 371 (1911); Day v. Philbrook, 89 Me. 462, 36 A. 991 (1897).\nThe Plaintiff must show a better title than the Defendant\u2019s. Coffin v. Freeman, 82 Me. 577, 20 A. 238 (1890). If the Plaintiff shows no title she cannot prevail even though she proves the Defendant has no title. Wyman v. Porter, supra; Derby v. Jones, 27 Me. 357 (1847). Although we have said that possession under color of title is better than no title, Wyman v. Porter, supra; Stetson v. Grant, 102 Me. 222, 66 A. 480 (1906), here the Plaintiff has shown no possession under color of her only claimed source of title \u2014 the 1964 deed from the town.\nIt follows that the invalidity of the appointment of the Tax Collector in 1961 rendered the town\u2019s tax lien for the 1960 taxes on the Philip Winslow lot ineffective and therefore the town acquired no title to the Philip Winslow lot by virtue of this lien. In short, the record here does not demonstrate any title to this lot in either Plaintiff or Defendant.\nThe Plaintiff\u2019s appeals are dismissed.\nThe Defendant Ralph L. Poland\u2019s appeal is denied.\nThe Defendant Robert D. Merrill\u2019s appeal is sustained. Remanded to the Superior Court for a revised judgment consistent with this opinion.\n. No appeals were taken by the corporate Defendants who were holders of mortgages on the real estate. The Plaintiff had also claimed damages from the Defendants, which the Justice denied her. Her cross-appeal from this denial was abandoned in this Court. Both Defendants had counterclaimed for betterments and the Presiding Justice gave Plaintiff judgment on Defendant Merrill\u2019s counterclaim but made no mention of that of Defendant Poland. Neither Defendant has raised the issue of counterclaims before us and we treat the issues as abandoned. State v. Trott, Me., 289 A.2d 414 (1972).\n. R.S.1954, Chap. 92, \u00a7 99, 36 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 943.\n. This limitation no longer prevails. P.L. 1969, Chap. 438, \u00a7 3, amending SO M.R. S.A. \u00a7 2055.",

        "text": "On Motion for Reconsideration\nThis opinion is supplemental to our opinion filed on July 25, 1972. On August 7, 1972 the Defendants-Appellants moved for reconsideration of the opinion. Briefs respecting the issue raised by the motion were filed by counsel for both sides.\nThe issue presented by the Defendants-Appellants concerns the effect which should be given to 36 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 943 and the common law presumption of regularity of acts of public officers.\nIt will be recalled that the Defendants-Appellants claimed title to certain real estate by virtue of deeds from the town of Poland. The Defendants-Appellants contend that the town had acquired title through the foreclosure of liens placed upon the property by the Tax Collector for three years\u2019 unpaid taxes. The Plaintiff-Appellee was the owner of the property at the time the taxes were assessed. The dis-positive issue before the Justice in the Superior Court was the validity of the appointment of the Tax Collector. The Justice ruled adversely to the Defendants-Appellants, holding that the Tax Collector had acted de facto but that he did not hold his office de jure. The Defendants-Appellants appealed.\nWe denied the appeal, pointing out that P.L.1957, ch. 405, \u00a7 36, \u00a7\u00a7 II (now 30 M. R.S.A. \u00a7 2060, \u00a7\u00a7 2) requires that the appointment of town officials be in writing and holding that in the case of Tax Collectors this was a \u201cmatter of substance\u201d and that therefore this officer did not hold his office de jure unless his appointment was in writing. We held that the Justice\u2019s finding that the procedures followed by the Selectmen fell short of constituting valid appointments to that office was not clearly erroneous.\nThe Defendants-Appellants now urge us that we inaccurately applied the substantive law relative to presumptions, particularly R.S.1954, ch. 92, \u00a7 99 as amended by P.L.1955, ch. 399, \u00a7 1 (which is now 36 M. R.S.A. \u00a7 943) which reads in part:\n\u201cThe tax lien mortgage shall be prima facie evidence in all courts in all proceedings by and against the municipality, its successors and assigns, of the truth of the statements therein and after the period of redemption has expired, of the title of the municipality to the real estate therein described, and of the regularity and validity of all proceedings with reference to the acquisition of title by such tax lien mortgage and the foreclosure thereof.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe Defendants-Appellants argue that neither the prima facie effect created by the statute nor the common law presumption of regularity in the acts of public officials can be overcome by an inference.\nIn our opinion of July 25, 1972 we discussed the effect of this statute and held that an inference that there was no appointment in writing could be drawn from evidence thus overcoming the statutory pri-ma facie proof regularity. The Defendants-Appellants contend that we did not give sufficient consideration to the effect of the statute and the common law presumption.\nFurther consideration of this matter has led us to the conclusion that, in the posture in which the parties stood, the Defendants-Appellants actually derive no benefit from this statute and that we originally gave it more significance than it deserves.\nOur Court has frequently recognized the use of disputable presumptions and prima facie evidence, sometimes using the terms interchangeably, and without indicating any distinction in the use of these procedural devices. We must reexamine our use of these terms.\nWe have several times discussed the nature of presumptions. In Kittery Electric Light Co. v. Assessors of the Town of Kittery, Me., 219 A.2d 728, 743 (1966) we said:\nIn Hinds v. John Hancock Ins. Co., 155 Me. 349, 155 A.2d 721, 85 A.L.R.2d 703, we established the use to be made of rebuttable presumptions. They are not \u2018evidence\u2019 in the scales with weight to be \u2018overcome\u2019. Rebut-table presumptions are rather merely procedural devices in the trial of a case, which have the effect of shifting to the other party, not the burden of proof, but the burden of going forward with evidence.\u201d\nIn Manchester v. Dugan, Me., 247 A.2d 827, 829 (1968) we compared the nature of presumptions with that of inferences:\n\u201cThe words \u2018presumption\u2019 and \u2018inference\u2019 are often used synonymously but a distinction exists. A presumption is a conclusion which a rule of law directs shall be made from proof of certain facts but an inference is a deduction which reason and logic dictates shall be made from a fact situation. An inference is a deduction as to the existence of a fact which human experience teaches us can reasonably and logically be drawn from proof of other facts. An inference must be based on probability and not on mere possibilities or on surmise or conjecture and must be drawn reasonably and supported by the facts upon which it rests. . . . \u201d\nWe pointed out in Hinds v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 155 Me. 349, 354, 155 A.2d 721, 726 (1959) that disputable presumptions are mandatory. That is, it may be declared legislatively or judicially that proof of certain fact-groupings results in proof of a certain presumed fact as a matter of law \u2014 if no contrary evidence is offered.\nWhile many courts speak of permissible presumptions \u2014 that is, presumptions which the jury is permitted to draw but not compelled to draw \u2014 we have concluded that, at least when used in criminal cases, the device is better described as an inference of fact. State v. Poulin, Me., 277 A.2d 493, 498 (1971); State v. Collamore, Me., 287 A.2d 123, 125 (1972).\nThe effect of both the disputable mandatory presumption and the permissible presumption or inference of fact is to get \u201cto the jury\u201d the proponent who relies upon them. C. McCormick, Law of Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 308, 310 (1954). Both are disputable.\nThe mandatory presumption shifts the burden of going forward with evidence to dispute the claimed fact to the other party. If the mandatory presumption is not rebutted, it is the duty of the trier of the fact to accept the presumed fact as proved. On the other hand, the inference of fact which human experience has taught us may reasonably and logically be drawn from proof of certain other facts will serve to get the proponent \u201cto the jury\u201d but the jury may find that those particular facts as presented, even if undisputed, do not justify a drawing of the inference from those facts or the jury may find that the inference has been overcome by the presentation of disputing facts.\nIf evidence is presented which disputes the effect of the mandatory presumption the procedural rule announced in Hinds operates and the presumption persists until the contrary evidence persuades the fact finder that the balance of probabilities is in equilibrium. Hinds v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, 155 Me. at 364, 155 A.2d at 730.\nThe presumption of regularity of the acts of public officers is a disputable mandatory presumption. Kellar v. Savage, 20 Me. 199, 203 (1841). The phrase \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d requires further examination. In using the phrase \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d in this section, did the Legislature intend to create an entirely new device which has an office distinct from that of either a disputable mandatory presumption or an inference of fact ?\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary, 1353 (4th ed. 1951) defines prima facie evidence as\n\u201cEvidence good and sufficient on its face; such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is sufficient to establish a given fact, or the group or chain of facts constituting the party\u2019s claim or defense, and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient.\nThe words \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d appear frequently in both our statutes and our decisional law. For example, in The Inhabitants of Augusta v. The Inhabitants of Vienna, 21 Me. 298 (1842) it was held that where a statutory notice which was required preliminary to liability for removal of a pauper had been deposited in the mails timely and had been received, this was \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d that its receipt was also timely. The Court said the result was a \u201cpresumption\u201d of timeliness which might be overcome by evidence.\nThe deposit of a letter, properly addressed, and stamped in the post office, has been held to be \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of its receipt by the addressee by due course of mail but this principle was held not to apply when the evidence showed the letter was not in fact so received. Chase v. Inhabitants of Surry, 88 Me. 468, 34 A. 270 (1896). See also Ross v. Reynolds, 112 Me. 223, 225-226, 91 A. 952, 953 (1914).\nOur Court has often stated that a violation of the law of the road is \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of negligence on the part of the violator.\n\u201c . . . It does not establish absolutely the defendant\u2019s liability. But, nothing else appearing, it sustains the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s negligence, which burden primarily rested upon the plaintiff. It creates a presumption in favor of the plaintiff which the defendant must overcome if he would prevail.\u201d Dansky v. Kotimaki, 125 Me. 72, 74, 130 A. 871, 873 (1925). See also Bennett v. Lufkin, 147 Me. 216, 218, 85 A.2d 922, 923 (1952); Elliott v. Montgomery, 135 Me. 372, 374, 197 A. 322, 323 (1938); Callahan v. Amos D. Bridges Sons, Inc., 128 Me. 346, 348, 147 A. 423, 424 (1929).\nThe Court used \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d and \u201cpresumption\u201d interchangeably in these cases and was describing a procedural device which, for policy reasons, had been judicially established and which (although not evidence to be weighed by the jury), entitled the party making use of it to a determination of negligence as a matter of law (not eliminating the necessity of proof of causation, of course) unless there was evidence introduced from which the jury could find that the conduct of the other party, although in violation of the law, was not in fact negligent conduct.\nIn Rand v. Skillin, 63 Me. 103, 104 (1873) we reasserted the rule that \u201ca warranty deed to the plaintiff, or a warranty deed to one from whom the plaintiff has a quit claim deed, is sufficient prima facie evidence of ownership, and will authorize a verdict for the plaintiff, unless the defendant proves a better title.\u201d\nA similar effect was given to the phrase \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d in the statute which was the predecessor of the paragraph of 36 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 943 which is now under consideration.\nIn 1936 that statute provided that in a trial involving the validity of any sale of real estate for non-payment of taxes,\n\u2022 it shall be sufficient for the party claiming under it, in the first instance, to produce in evidence the collector\u2019s or treasurer\u2019s deed, duly executed and recorded, which shall be prima facie evidence of his title . . ..\u201d R.S.1930, ch. 14, \u00a7 87.\nIn City of Old Town v. Thomas, 134 Me. 285, 289, 186 A. 663, 665 (1936) the plaintiff City presented such deeds and also the formal return of the tax sale by which the City claimed the owner had been divested of his title. The return had not been signed by the officer, in violation of a statutory mandate. The defendant offered no evidence. The Court rejected the City\u2019s contention that as the tax deed made out a prima facie case and as the defendant had offered no evidence, the City was entitled to judgment, holding that the \u201cpri-ma facie showing\u201d of the tax deeds had been \u201covercome\u201d by the City\u2019s own production of the defective return.\nWe turn now to the use of the phrase \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d in the statute now under consideration. We believe that the Legislature\u2019s purpose was to enable municipalities and litigants claiming title through municipalities to avoid the expensive and time consuming proof of the correctness of every step involved in a municipality\u2019s acquisition of title by the tax lien process. The statute is based on what Professor Torc\u00eda calls \u201cprocedural expediency\u201d. 1 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence 144 (13th ed. 1972).\nThe Legislature was no doubt familiar with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the effect of the use of the phrase \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d in other statutes and concluded that the phrase, as so interpreted, would accomplish the purpose of 36 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 943. McLellan v. Lunt, 14 Me. 254, 258 (1837).\nWe are convinced that the statute was intended to create only a procedural device in the nature of a mandatory rebut-table presumption which, in lieu of presentation of evidence as to regularity by the party claiming regularity, was intended to shift the burden of going forward with evidence as to regularity upon the party claiming irregularity. The common law presumption of regularity of the actions of public officials has the same effect. Both are procedural devices. Neither is evidence.\nWith this understanding of the true nature of the statutory device and its resemblance to a mandatory rebuttable presumption, it becomes clear that neither has significance in this case.\nWe said in Kittery Electric Light Co. v. Assessors of the Town of Kittery, supra, 219 A.2d at 743:\n\u201c. . . A party however has no need of the aid of rebuttable presumption in order to shift the burden of going forward with evidence to an opponent who already has been charged from the outset with the burden of proof or persuasion with respect to a particular issue. As was stated in 20 Am.Jur. Evidence, \u00a7 157: \u2018During the trial of an action, the party who has the burden of proof upon an issue may be aided in establishing his claim or defense by the operation of a presumption, ... a presumption may operate to relieve a party of the duty of presenting evidence until his adversary has introduced proof to rebut the presumption.\u2019 [Emphasis supplied]. In the instant case, the plaintiff taxpayer had the burden of proof from the beginning; this necessarily included the subsidiary burden of going forward with evidence. There was no occasion for the Justice below to advert to the presumption of validity attaching to the acts of public officials since that presumption could do no more than cast upon the plaintiff taxpayer a burden which it had already assumed.\u201d\nHere the Plaintiff maintained that she still had title to the property because of an irregularity in the town\u2019s claimed acquisition of title through the tax lien procedure. Neither the statute nor the presumption shifted the burden of going forward to her \u2014she had the burden of proof of irregularity from the beginning. The measure of her burden was proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence.\nTherefore, it is not necessary for us to consider whether the Legislature intended that the effective weight of the device should disappear when \u201ccontrary evidence persuades the factfinder that the balance of probabilities is in equilibrium\u201d (Hinds v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, 155 Me. at 364, 155 A.2d at 730 (1959) or when some other quantum of credible contrary evidence is received. Any expression of opinion as to this would be dicta and particularly undesirable as this precise issue was not argued.\nIn our opinion of July 25, 1972 we discussed the evidence presented as to the manner in which the Selectmen purported to appoint the Town Manager to the office of Tax Collector. It can be fairly stated in summary that the evidence showed that while the employment of the Town Manager was by means of an annual written contract it was \u201cunderstood\u201d and mutually agreed that he should also serve as Tax Collector. One Selectman agreed that \u201ctechnically\u201d the Town Manager wasn\u2019t \u201cappointed\u201d but it was \u201cthe understanding\u201d that he should also serve in that capacity. Near the close of the trial after a great deal of evidence had been presented as to the informal manner in which the Tax Collector was appointed, the Justice inquired if the manner of the Town Manager\u2019s appointment could not be stipulated and Defendants-Appellants\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cI can stipulate that the only provisions made are as brought out in the direct testimony and contained in the minutes.\u201d From the abundance of direct testimony as to the manner in which the appointment was made and from the minutes an inference could properly be drawn that it was not made in writing. The Justice could have found that by means of this inference the Plaintiff satisfied her burden of proof.\nOur reconsideration has satisfied us that the entry on Defendants-Appellants\u2019 motion must be:\nThe opinion of July 25, 1972 shall stand.\n. We are not concerned here with conclusive mandatory presumptions. Examples of conclusive mandatory presumptions would be the judicially created conclusive presumption that a child under the age of 7 years is incapable of criminal guilt (Allen v. United States, 150 U.S. 551, 558, 14 S.Ct. 196, 198, 37 L.Ed. 1179, 1181 (1893); 1 R. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 35) and the statutory conclusive presumption that certain persons are wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee under our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. 39 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2; Albee\u2019s Case, 128 Me. 126, 145 A. 742 (1929).\n. Of course, if there is no other disputed issue of fact the party who has the benefit of an unrebutted mandatory presumption may be entitled to a directed verdict in a civil action.",
