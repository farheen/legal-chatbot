        "text": "MACK, Senior Judge:\nThis neglect proceeding evolved when a family made an emergency trip to a hospital because of the young mother\u2019s severe back pain, when her hungry, bottle-fed, twenty-five-day-old infant began crying during the ensuing wait for the mother\u2019s treatment, and when an exasperated father administered excessive discipline in an attempt to quiet the infant.\nThe trial judge, hearing a child neglect petition filed by the District against the parents of the infant, A.S., found that the government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that A.S. was a neglected child pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(A) because of abuse by the father in shaking and spanking the infant. The court also found that the government had proved neglect (on the part of both parents) pursuant to \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B) in view of the testimony of an emergency room hospital physician (who examined the crying baby) that A.S. was suffering from clinical dehydration.\nThe mother (B.S.) alone appeals, urging that under the circumstances of this case, the evidence of the dehydration of A.S. did not rise to the level of statutory neglect. We agree and we recite those circumstances in further detail below.\nI.\nOn the morning of September 7, 1991, B.S., mother of A.S. and appellant in this case, was taken by her husband to Providence Hospital after she began experiencing severe back pains. The infant, A.S., who was twenty-five days old at the time, was carried by his parents to the hospital. While B.S. waited to be examined by the next available physician, the father went to the cafeteria for breakfast and took A.S. with him, leaving the child\u2019s bottle with B.S. in the waiting room. Before A.S. and his father returned from the cafeteria, B.S. was admitted into the examination room. B.S. carried with her the baby bag which contained A.S.\u2019s bottled formula. When A.S. and his father returned to the waiting room, A.S. began to cry. Unsuccessful in his attempts to quiet A.S., the father carried the infant outside of the hospital. A hospital employee, who was outside on a cigarette break, noticed the father shaking A.S. in a rough manner. After observing the father strike the infant\u2019s buttocks and order him to stop crying, the hospital employee hurried back to the emergency room and returned with a nurse. The nurse witnessed the father forcefully strike A.S. on the buttocks before security guards were called to the scene. When the father noticed the hospital staff and security approaching him, he willingly handed A.S. to a security guard. Shortly thereafter, A.S. was examined by Dr. Paul Matera, an emergency room physician, who found all of the infant\u2019s vital signs to be normal, but determined that the child was clinically dehydrated. A.S. was then fed a four-ounce bottle of pedialyte solution, an electrolyte solution specifically for infant consumption. Following an investigation, the District of Columbia filed a child neglect petition against the parents alleging that A.S. was a neglected child pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(A), (B), and (C) (1989).\nThe trial court held a factfinding hearing on the District\u2019s petition. At this hearing, both parents testified that on the morning of September 7, 1991, A.S. was fed an eight-ounce bottle of formula between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. and another bottle while riding in the taxicab to the hospital. B.S. also stated that A.S. had a healthy appetite and that he was usually fed every one and one-half hours. On behalf of the government, Dr. Matera testified that A.S. was diagnosed as suffering from \u201cclinical dehydration\u201d because the mucous membranes in his mouth were \u201cfairly dry\u201d and both the anterior and posterior fontanels were recessed. Dr. Matera also indicated that in his medical opinion, A.S. missed anywhere from one to three feedings and that he had been without food or liquids for six hours. Following the hearing, the trial court concluded that the government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that A.S. was neglected under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(A) and (B) (1989), but failed to demonstrate \u201cneglect\u201d as provided in D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(C). The trial court\u2019s adjudication of neglect pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(A), which relates to child abuse, was supported by the father\u2019s conduct, but both parents were found \u201cjointly, albeit in different degrees, responsible for the deprivation under [D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B) ].\u201d In reaching its conclusion that A.S. was a neglected child under D.C.Code \u00a7 16 \u2014 2301(9)(B), the trial court relied solely upon Dr. Matera\u2019s testimony that A.S. was clinically dehydrated. The trial judge then entered a disposition order placing A.S. in the custody of I.C., B.S.\u2019 cousin, and directed the government to submit written reports to the court by July 1, 1992, concerning the developmental assessment of the child as well as progress reports on the parents.\nII.\nIn a case tried by the judge without a jury, the judgment will not be disturbed on appeal except for errors of law \u201cunless it is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d In re S.G., 581 A.2d 771, 774 (D.C.1990) (quoting D.C.Code \u00a7 17-305(a) (1989)). See also In re D.G., 561 A.2d 477, 479 (D.C.1989) (per curiam). It is also generally accepted that in a child neglect proceeding, the government is required to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence. In re 630 A.2d 186, 192 (D.C.1993); In re S.G., supra, 581 A.2d at 774; In re N.H., 569 A.2d 1179, 1182 (D.C.1990); In re B.K, 429 A.2d 1331, 1333 (D.C.1981) (per curiam). When an appellant raises a claim of evidentiary insufficiency, we are bound to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence. See In re S.G., supra, 581 A.2d at 774; In re T.M., 577 A.2d 1149, 1151 (D.C.1990).\nWithin this framework, we question the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence in this record was clearly sufficient to demonstrate that A.S. was neglected within the meaning of D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B). Dr. Matera testified that the feeding schedule of a normal child of A.S.\u2019 age would range from one and one-half hours to three hours on the hour. He also indicated that a clinical judgment on the hydration of a child is readily determined by examining (1) the mucous membranes in the child\u2019s mouth, and (2) the anterior and posterior fontanels on the child\u2019s head. In his examination of A.S., Dr. Matera found that his mucous membranes were \u201cfairly dry and that the fontanels were sunken or lacked pressure which would indicate some dehydration.\u201d Based on these symptoms, Dr. Matera opined that A.S. missed anywhere from one to three feedings and that he had been without food or liquids for six hours. Despite his diagnosis that A.S. was clinically dehydrated, Dr. Matera did not testify that A.S. sustained any injury or that he was in any danger of injury or illness based on his examination. In fact, Dr. Mat-era indicated that all of A.S.\u2019 vital signs were stable and normal. Recognizing that \u201c[n]e-glect proceedings are remedial and focus on the child,\u201d In re J.J.Z., supra, 630 A.2d at 191-92 (internal quotation and citation omitted); see also In re B.C., 582 A.2d 1196, 1198 (D.C.1990) (per curiam) (\u201crelevant focus for the court under \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B) is the children\u2019s condition, not the [parent\u2019s] culpability\u201d), the evidence, at best, establishes that A.S. was upset because he was hungry and that this hunger resulted from missing anywhere from one to three feedings. Indeed, Dr. Matera testified that A.S., after drinking the hospital\u2019s formula, ceased to cry and \u201cwas essentially acting fairly normal, after that, playful.\u201d\nIn determining whether a child\u2019s welfare requires the intervention of the state, the trial court\u2019s inquiry must go beyond \u201c \u2018simply examining the most recent episode.\u2019 \u201d In re J.J.Z., supra, 630 A.2d at 194 (quoting In re O.L., 584 A.2d 1230, 1233 (D.C.1990)). \u201c \u2018[T]he judge must be apprised of the entire mosaic.\u2019\u201d In re O.L., supra, 584 A.2d at 1233 (quoting In re S.K., 564 A.2d 1382, 1389 (D.C.App.1989)). Unlike those neglect cases in which there has been a history or pattern of child neglect, see generally In re A.M., 589 A.2d 1252, 1253 (D.C.1991) (neglected child was frequently sent to school hungry, unkempt, and without adequate clothing); In re D.C., supra, 561 A.2d at 478 (mother found to have neglected her thirteen-month-old baby who was injured while left in the care of his nine and one-half year old brother on several occasions), there is no evidence in the record which suggests that A.S. was not properly cared for by B.S. prior to the September 7, 1991 incident. We also find relevant the circumstances which led to the disruption of A.S.\u2019 feeding schedule on the day in question. After she had given birth to A.S., B.S. developed severe back pains, which eventually caused her to seek medical attention on September 7, 1991. The fact that B.S. was undergoing a physical examination of her back at the time A.S. wanted his formula should not be viewed as an indication of neglect.\n\u201cThe purpose of the child neglect statute is to promote the best interests of allegedly neglected children.\u201d In re B.C., 582 A.2d 1196, 1198 (D.C.1990) (per curiam); see also In re supra, 630 A.2d at 192; In re J.A., 601 A.2d 69, 76 (D.C.1991) (per curiam) (\u201cstatutes and our caselaw make clear that the child\u2019s interests are of paramount importance\u201d); In re A.M., supra, 589 A.2d at 1257 (the legal touchstone in neglect cases is \u201cthe best interests of the child, and those interests are controlling\u201d); In re Lem, 164 A.2d 345, 348 (D.C.1960). However, these \u201cinterests are presumptively served by being with a parent, provided that the parent is not unfit.\u201d In re S.G., supra, 581 A.2d at 785. See also In re L.J.T., 608 A.2d 1213, 1216 (D.C.1992) (per curiam) (\u201cWe have repeatedly stressed the existence of a preference toward placing children with their natural parents\u201d); In re N.H., supra, 569 A.2d at 1181-82 (\u201cThe right of a natural parent to raise one\u2019s child is a fundamental and essential precept which is constitutionally protected\u201d); D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2320(a) (1989). \u201c \u2018The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents_\u2019 \u201d In re S.G., supra, 581 A.2d at 778 (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982)); see also In re N.H., supra, 569 A.2d at 1181. Even when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the government, we are unable to conclude that the government sufficiently overcame its burden to establish neglect under \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B). We emphasize that our decision is not meant to be interpreted as holding that dehydration of an infant would never constitute a basis for neglect under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B). The chilling reality of unfit parents failing to care for their infants is well documented in the case law of the District as well as other jurisdictions. See Faunteroy v. United States, 413 A.2d 1294 (D.C.1980); In re R.J.M., 164 W.Va. 496, 266 S.E.2d 114 (1980); In re Maureen G., 103 Misc.2d 109, 426 N.Y.S.2d 384 (N.Y.Fam.Ct.1980); Lackey v. State, 246 Ga. 331, 271 S.E.2d 478 (1980); In re Black, 273 Pa.Super. 536, 417 A.2d 1178 (1980); McClaskey v. State, 540 N.E.2d 41 (Ind.1989); Ahearn v. State, 588 S.W.2d 327 (Tex.Crim.App.1979). We hold only that the evidence in this record of dehydration does not support a finding of statutory neglect. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s adjudication of neglect pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B).\nSo ordered.\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9) (1989), provides that the term \"neglected child\u201d means a child:\n(A) who has been abandoned or abused by his or her parent, guardian, or other custodian; or\n(B) who is without proper parental care or control, subsistence, ... or other care or control necessary for his or her physical, mental, or emotional health, and the deprivation is not due to the lack of financial means of his or her parent, guardian, or other custodian; or\n(C) whose parent, guardian, or other custodian is unable to discharge his or her responsibilities to and for the child because of incarceration, hospitalization, or other physical or mental incapacity....\n. The trial court also held that the government had failed to prove that A.S. was a neglected child pursuant to \u00a7 16-2301(9)(C) because of the inability of the mother (with back problems) and the father (with kidney failure) to care for the infant.\n. A.S. was bom on August 13, 1991.\n. Dr. Matera explained that \"fontanels\" are \u201cspaces in the anterior and posterior of the skull that close after a period of time.\u201d\n. These reports are not included in the record.\n. At the time of the hearing, B.S. testified that physical therapy helped to alleviate her back pains.",
