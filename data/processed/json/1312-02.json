On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove an intent to hunt at night. After reviewing the record, we conclude that sufficient evidence was presented to establish beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to commit the crime of night hunting. See State v. Hillock, 384 A.2d 437, 440 (Me.1978).\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.",
