        "text": "FARRELL, Associate Judge:\nThis appeal by the District of Columbia from the dismissal of a neglect petition presents the sole issue of whether a \u201csibling\u201d for purposes of D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E) (1997) (partly defining a \u201cneglected child\u201d) includes a child who is neither the biological nor the adopted brother or sister of the children alleged to be neglected. We hold that it does not, and affirm the order dismissing on that ground.\nI.\nOn August 27, 1998, the District filed petitions alleging that D.W. and M.W., thirteen and ten year old boys, respectively, were neglected children in that each was \u201cin imminent danger of being abused by his guardians, and said child\u2019s cousin, who was also under the care of said child\u2019s guardians, [had] been abused.\u201d The guardians, L.B. and T.B., were alleged to have been the caregivers of D.W. since the child was five, and of M.W. since he was approximately a month old. They were similarly alleged to have had custody of the cousin, S.T., until November 11, 1997, when she was brought to the hospital where she died of injuries, at the age of two. According to the petitions, the District of Columbia Medical Examiner had determined that \u201cthe injuries were nonac-cidental, and ... that [S.T.\u2019s] death was a homicide.\u201d The District of Columbia sought an adjudication that D.W. and M.W. were neglected children under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E), which defines a \u201cneglected child\u201d to include a child \u201cwho is in imminent danger of being abused and whose sibling has been abused.\u201d\nAlthough \u00a7 16-2301(9) provides additional definitions of a neglected child, the District acknowledged that it had \u201cpetitioned no other allegations of neglect and [was] prepared to proceed to trial on the Section 16-2301(9)(E) allegation\u201d alone. It requested an in limine ruling by the court that S.T. was a \u201csibling\u201d of D.W. and M.W. because she was their cousin and had \u201clived in the same home as [they did] in the full time care of [L.B. and T.B.] from September to November 11, 1997.\u201d The District contended that \u201crelated children living in the same home under the full time care of the same care providers constitute siblings under the common meaning of [\u00a7 ] 16-2301(9)(E).\u201d The Superior Court rejected this interpretation of the statute and dismissed the petitions, concluding that D.W. and M.W. \u201cdo not constitute 'siblings\u2019 of the deceased minor, [S.T.], under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2301 [ (9) ](E).\u201d\nII.\nThe issue before us is one of statutory interpretation. On appeal the District poses the issue (somewhat differently than it did in the trial court) as whether \u201csibling[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E) \u201cinclude children who are living together permanently, on a long-term basis, or indefinitely, with the same primary custodians.\u201d The District points out (correctly) that the neglect statute does not define \u201csibling,\u201d and asserts that the term \u201chas no plain meaning\u201d as a matter of common usage and, \u201c[e]ven if it did, rules of statutory construction require that the term be liberally construed to effectuate the abuse and neglect statute\u2019s broad purpose of protecting all of the District\u2019s children from abuse and neglect.\u201d\nIn only one other published opinion have we discussed, briefly, the meaning of the term \u201csibling\u201d as used in \u00a7 16 \u2014 2301(9)(E). In re S.G., 581 A.2d 771 (D.C.1990), concerned children who were biological half-siblings. Although the issue of whether they were siblings within the statutory meaning was not presented, we had occasion to state that courts elsewhere \u201chave treated half-siblings as siblings\u201d and noted that \u201cone definition of sibling, probably the most appropriate here, includes \u2018one of two or more persons having one common parent.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 778 n. 10 (quoting Webster s New Collegiate Dictionary 806 (1970)). The present case, of course, involves allegedly neglected children who have no parent in common with the third child in question, but the District is correct that the S.G. court did not intend to define the reach of \u201csibling.\u201d\n\"When interpreting the language of a statute, \u201cthis court examines the plain meaning of the language used and, \u2018absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u2019 \u201d In re G.G., 667 A.2d 1331, 1334 (D.C.1995) (citations omitted). The District\u2019s initial argument that the term \u201csibling\u201d has no plain meaning in ordinary usage is unconvincing. The common understanding of the word, reflected in nearly all dictionary definitions, is of a brother or sister, i.e., \u201cone of two or more persons born of the same parents or ... sometimes having one parent in common.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World College DICTIONARY 1331 (4th ed.1999). See also, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New INTERNATIONAL Dictionary 2110 (3rd ed.1986); The AmeriCAN Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1675 (3rd ed.1992). Thus, if instead of employing the word \u201csibling,\u201d section 16 \u2014 2301(9)(E) had said \u201cbrother or sister,\u201d the District would not plausibly be able to argue that the terms include the class of any children living together permanently with the same caregivers, without further limitation. That would stretch the meaning of brother or sister beyond recognition. The District has not persuaded us that by using the word \u201csibling\u201d the legislature meant to convey more than the normal understanding of that word.\nThe District fixes upon the term \u201cparent\u201d used by dictionaries in defining \u201csibling\u201d (i.e., persons having \u201cone or both parents in common\u201d) and points to that term\u2019s dictionary definition as including, broadly, a \u201cguardian\u201d and/or a \u201cprotector,\u201d not just a biological parent. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 798 (1995). But it is illogical to suppose that when a dictionary defines term A by reference to term B (and other terms), it necessarily incorporates all of B\u2019s definitions, even the broadest. The fact that \u201cparent,\u201d in life and the law, may connote more than a biological or adoptive relationship tells us nothing about the customary meaning of \u201csibling.\u201d More significant, in any case, is the way the terms are used in the neglect statute itself. In keeping with its protective purpose, the statute draws no distinction between \u201cparent,\u201d \u201cguardian,\u201d or \u201cother custodian\u201d in specifying the persons who may be charged with neglecting a child, so as to require state intervention. See \u00a7 16-2301(9) (;passim). Even with respect to \u201cabused\u201d children, as we have seen, the class is defined liberally to include a child not himself or herself abused but in \u201cimminent danger\u201d of such treatment \u201cand whose sibling has been abused.\u201d If the legislature meant \u201csibling\u201d to be read broadly \u2014 to include any child residing permanently with the same custodian \u2014 one would expect it to have made that explicit just as it did in equating \u201cparent\u201d with \u201ccustodian\u201d (and, to a lesser extent, abused child with child in imminent danger of abuse). It did not. The implication is that, as elsewhere in the District of Columbia Code, the legislature did not intend \u201csibling\u201d to extend as far as the District would have it do. See, e.g., D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-4101(10)(A) & -4120(a)(2) (1996) (permitting enhanced punishment for crimes of sexual abuse where the victim was under 18 years old and the defendant \u201chad a significant relationship to the victim,\u201d and defining \u201csignificant relationship\u201d to include \u201c[a] parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, or grandparent, whether related by blood, marriage, or adoption\u201d (emphasis added)).\nThe District cites no legislative history supporting its broad interpretation, nor have we found any. Although the neglect statute is remedial and thus to be \u201cliberally construed to achieve that end,\u201d In re T.W., 732 A.2d 254, 258 (D.C.1999), that principle does not allow us to engraft a definition on the statutory term inconsistent with its ordinary meaning and dictated by nothing in the statute or its genesis. Indeed, since abuse of a sibling under \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E) stands as something of a proxy for actual abuse of the child allegedly neglected (as well as providing critical proof of the \u201cimminent danger\u201d of abuse to that child), it is natural to assume that the legislature meant the relationship between these children to be just as close as \u201csibling\u201d normally denotes.\nWe also are not persuaded by the District\u2019s argument that refusal to construe the term broadly will endanger \u201cthe increasing numbers of children who are not biological siblings and do not live with their biological parents, but, rather, live together in the ... long-term ... custodial care of the same primary care-givers.\u201d If that concern is justified, then the District should meet no obstacle in obtaining a statutory clarification of the meaning of the term by the Council of the District of Columbia. And it is debatable in any case whether the District has only \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E) at its disposal when confronting neglect based primarily on abuse of other children in the household. See, e.g., \u00a7 16-2301(9)(B) (neglected child defined broadly as one \u201cwithout proper parental care or control ... necessary for his or her physical, mental, or emotional health\u201d).\nIn summary, the trial court correctly ruled that the child S.T. is not a sibling within the meaning of \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E). The order dismissing the neglect petition is, therefore,\nAffirmed.\n. The District thus no longer attaches significance to the fact that the boys were alleged to be related to S.T. as cousins. We take the case on that basis, although we agree with the District that the fact that the children may have been cousins has no importance to the statutory analysis.\n. In other contexts, specifically in determining relationships under the laws of intestacy, our local statute provides that \"[t]here is no distinction between the kindred of the whole- and the half-blood.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 19-315 (1997).\n. In this jurisdiction, \"[a] final decree of adoption establishes the relationship of natural parent and natural child between the adopter and the adoptee for all purposes.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 16-312(a).\n. \"[C]ustodian\u201d is defined broadly to mean:\na person or agency, other than a parent or legal guardian:\n(A) to whom the legal custody of a child has been granted by the order of a court;\n(B) who is acting in loco parentis; or\n(C) who is a day care provider or an employee of a residential facility, in the case of the placement of an abused or neglected child.\n. Cf. also D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1415(b)(3)(C) (1998) (prohibiting appointment as receiver of a nursing home or community residence facility of \"[a] parent, child, grandchild, spouse, sibling, first cousin, aunt, or uncle of one of the facility's residents, whether the relationship arises by blood, marriage, or adoption\u201d). Strictly speaking, this case does not require us to decide whether \"sibling\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 16-2301(9)(E) includes an adopted brother or sister, although that would be a natural understanding of the term.\n.Further suggesting a restrictive reading is that, as we emphasized in In re S.G., supra, \"[t]he plain language of [\u00a7 16-2301(9)(E) ] requires the government ... to establish both the abuse of the sibling and imminent danger to the child before a finding of neglect may be made.\u201d 581 A.2d at 778 (emphasis added).\n. We note that the Council has amended the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-2101 et seq. (1995), to require the District to make reasonable efforts \u201cto preserve and reunify the family\u201d of a child removed from the home, except that these efforts are not required in the case of a parent who has committed specified acts upon the child or \u201ca sibling or another child \u201d (emphasis added).
