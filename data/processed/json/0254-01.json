        "text": "PER CURIAM.\nThe issue in this case is whether the defendant has a right to appeal his sentences imposed by the Court of Common Pleas based upon either the amount of the fine assessed or the length of imprisonment imposed. The Superior Court concluded that the cost of a psychological evaluation did not constitute a \u201cfine\u201d in order to satisfy the jurisdictional threshold for taking an appeal from a sentence of a fine. The Superior Court also concluded that the defendant\u2019s level V sentences, which were suspended entirely for probation at a lesser level, were not sentences of \u201cimprisonment\u201d and, therefore, did not meet the jurisdictional threshold for taking an appeal from a sentence of imprisonment. While we agree that the defendant was not assessed a \u201cfine\u201d in excess of the appellate threshold, we hold that a sentence of imprisonment at Level V for more than thirty days, even if suspended for probation, is appealable. Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.\nFacts\nThe defendant, Allen M. Weaver, was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas on one count of lewdness and one count of second degree indecent exposure. On the lewdness charge, Weaver was sentenced to two months at level V imprisonment, suspended entirely for one year at level III probation and a $100 fine. On the other charge, Weaver was sentenced to a concurrent term of one month at level V imprisonment, suspended entirely for one year at level II probation. As a condition of probation, the court ordered Weaver to undergo a psychological evaluation and register as a sex offender.\nWeaver appealed his convictions and sentences to the Superior Court pursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 5301(c) and Del. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 28, which provide for a right of appeal to the Superior Court from a criminal conviction in the Court of Common Pleas when the sentence imposed is \u201cimprisonment exceeding one (1) month, or a fine exceeding One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).\u201d The Superior Court dismissed Weaver\u2019s appeal because his suspended sentences did not meet the jurisdictional threshold.\nWeaver then appealed to this Court. After being submitted for decision on the basis of the briefs, a panel of this Court remanded the case to the Superior Court to address two issues:\nA. Does the imposition of the condition that the defendant undergo a psychological evaluation impose an additional financial penalty, the effect of which is to satisfy the constitutional threshold, ie., a fine exceeding one hundred dollars?\nB. Does a sentence of imprisonment for more than one month, suspended for probation, meet the constitutional threshold in view of the detriment the defendant faces if his probation is thereafter revoked (under a standard of proof of preponderance of the evidence) and a term of imprisonment of more than one month is imposed as a result?\nIn a memorandum opinion dated January 5, 2001, the Superior Court answered both questions in the negative. The parties filed supplemental memoranda on these two issues, and the case was resubmitted for decision by the panel on the basis of the parties\u2019 supplemental briefs. Thereafter, the Court decided to consider these issues en banc.\nCost of Psychological Evaluation Not a \u201cFine\u201d\nThis Court previously has accepted Webster\u2019s definition of the word \u201cfine\u201d to mean \u201ca sum imposed as punishment for an offense.\u201d Accordingly, in Brookens v. State, this Court held that a 15% penalty assessment for the Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund did not constitute a \u201cfine\u201d under Delaware law because, among other reasons, the assessment was compensatory and not punitive in nature. Similarly, in Benton v. State, the Court held that court-ordered restitution did not constitute a fine because it \u201cwas neither punitive nor to be paid for the benefit of a sovereign.\u201d\nIn light of these precedents, we find that the cost of the psychological evaluation in Weaver\u2019s case did not constitute a \u201cfine\u201d under Delaware law. Given Weaver\u2019s offenses, the psychological evaluation was necessary to determine Weaver\u2019s need for treatment. The cost of the psychological evaluation was neither punitive in nature nor was it payable to the State. Accordingly, the Superior Court\u2019s ruling that the cost of the psychological evaluation was not a \u201cfine\u201d is AFFIRMED.\nAppealability of Probationary Sentences Prior Cases\nIn this case, the Superior Court ruled that a sentence of incarceration exceeding one month, which was suspended entirely for probation, did not meet the jurisdictional threshold of a sentence of \u201cimprisonment exceeding one month\u201d under Section 28 of article IV of the Delaware Constitution. The Superior Court concluded on remand that dismissal of Weaver\u2019s appeal was compelled by this Court\u2019s decision in Jewell v. State, and other decisions to the same effect. We agree that the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal of Weaver\u2019s appeal is supported by precedent, but those holdings have been called into question. We deem it appropriate that the Court, sitting en banc, consider that question anew.\nLevel V Sentence Constitutes \u201cImprisonment\u2019 \u2019\nIn 1987, in response to major sentencing reform efforts undertaken by the Sentencing Accountability Commission (SEN-TAC), the Delaware General Assembly amended 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4204(c) to create a continuum of authorized sentencing sanctions ranging in severity from accountability level I to accountability level V. The levels of sentencing are distinguished by the amount of control the Department of Correction exercises over a convicted offender. Level V, the most restrictive sanction, is defined as \u201cthe commitment of the offender to the Department of Correction for a period of incarceration, with or without the imposition of a fine provided by law for the offense.\u201d\nThus by its definition, a level V sentence, which requires a period of incarceration, constitutes a sentence of \u201cimprisonment\u201d under the Delaware Constitution. We therefore hold that Weaver\u2019s sentence to two months at level V incarceration, on its face, satisfies the constitutional threshold for taking an appeal. The more pointed question is whether the trial court, by suspending execution of Weaver\u2019s otherwise appealable level V sentence, could render the sentence unappealable. This Court has never squarely addressed this issue.\nSuspended Sentence is Appealable\nIn Delaware, the benchmark of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in a criminal case is the pronouncement of sentence. The United States Supreme Court recognized long ago that an order imposing sentence upon a defendant is a final, appealable order even if execution of the sentence is suspended for probation. Thus, in Delaware a defendant\u2019s time limit to file a direct appeal from a conviction and sentence begins to run on the date following the pronouncement of sentence, regardless of whether execution of the sentence is suspended for probation.\nIf a level V sentence in excess of one month, which is suspended entirely for probation, is found to be unappealable because it fails to meet the jurisdictional threshold, then a defendant effectively has forever lost the right to appeal from an underlying conviction and sentence. Even if the defendant later is found in violation of probation (VOP) and ultimately is sentenced as a result of that VOP to serve actual incarceration well in excess of the constitutional threshold, the defendant will never have the opportunity to challenge directly the criminal conviction that forms the underlying basis of the jail sentence.\nSuch a result is fundamentally unfair in light of the lengthy prison sentences that may result from a VOP proceeding with its procedural informalities. A probationer has no absolute right to counsel at a VOP hearing or on appeal following a VOP adjudication. Furthermore, the trial court has broad authority to find a probation violation applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, in contrast to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for the initial conviction. If the trial court finds the defendant has violated probation, it may terminate the defendant\u2019s probation and reimpose a prison term \u201cat any time.\u201d Finally, upon finding a violation of probation, the Court may impose all or any portion of the sentence originally suspended.\nBalancing the informal and summary nature of VOP proceedings against the potentially harsh prison sentences that may result, we conclude that the better policy is to afford a defendant the right to appeal a level V sentence upon its imposition, without regal\u2019d to whether execution of the sentence is suspended for probation. Such a result is consistent with the policy that encourages construing statutes in favor of recognizing a right to appeal.\nSince appeals from the Superior Court to this Court in criminal cases are subject to a parallel constitutional threshold under article IV, \u00a7 ll(l)(b) of the Delaware Constitution, our holding directed to the present appeal from the Court of Common Pleas to the Superior Court has equal application to appeals from the Superior Court to this Court.\nConclusion\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part. This matter shall be remanded for the Superior Court to consider Weaver\u2019s appeal on its merits. Any precedent contrary to the decision we now reach is hereby overruled.\n. Although it is not clear from the sentencing order, we assume for purposes of this decision that the psychological evaluation was ordered at Weaver\u2019s expense.\n. 11 Del. C. \u00a7 5301(c) provides:\nFrom any order, rule, decision, judgment or sentence of the Court [of Common Pleas] in a criminal action, the accused shall have the right of appeal to the Superior Court in and for the county wherein the information was filed as provided in \u00a7 28, article IV of the Constitution of the State. Such appeal to the Superior Court shall be reviewed on the record and shall not be tried de novo.\n. Article IV, \u00a7 28 of the Delaware Constitution regulates the criminal jurisdiction of Delaware trial courts.
