        "text": "FERREN, Associate Judge:\nThis disciplinary proceeding presents two principal questions: (1) whether an attorney\u2019s chronic depression at the time of misconduct may be used as a mitigating factor in fashioning the appropriate disposition, and (2) if so, whether the attorney\u2019s depression may serve as the basis for imposing a period of probation, premised on mitigation, that exceeds the period of suspension from the practice of law that would otherwise be warranted. The Board on Professional Responsibility found respondent had neglected a legal matter entrusted to him, DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3), had intentionally failed to seek a client\u2019s lawful objectives, DR V \u2014 101(A)(1), and had engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation, DR 1-102(A)(4). Respondent offered medical evidence of his chronic depression and, at the hearing before the Hearing Committee, consented to a two-year period of probation. When the matter came before the Board, a majority found a causal nexus between respondent\u2019s depression and his professional misconduct and recommended four months\u2019 suspension from practice, with two months of suspension stayed on condition that respondent comply with the terms of a two-year supervised probation. Respondent filed no objection to this recommendation. A minority of the Board, however, found no causal nexus between respondent\u2019s depression and his misconduct and, accordingly, recommended the full four-month suspension without a stay, followed by a two-year period of supervised probation. We adopt the findings of the Board majority as well as the disposition it recommends.\nI.\nIn March 1978, respondent Peek agreed to represent complainant in a civil suit. Complainant had filed a complaint with the Metropolitan Police Department alleging that, on March 8, 1978, she had been forcibly abducted from a common area of her apartment building, dragged into an adjacent, unlocked, abandoned laundry room, and forcibly raped. Three years later on March 7, 1981, the last day before the statute of limitations for bringing the civil suit expired, respondent filed a complaint in Superior Court. Summonses were issued for three defendants. The first two defendants were served promptly and.; answered the complaint. The third defendant was never served, however, and did not answer.\nBecause respondent never obtained service on the third defendant, the case was not set for trial. Nor did respondent undertake any discovery. On January 29, 1985, the two defendants who had answered filed motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute, pursuant to Super.Ct.Civ.R. 41(b). Respondent failed to oppose; the motions were granted with prejudice. Respondent took no action to reinstate the complaint within the time permitted by local court rules.\nThroughout this period, complainant telephoned respondent on many occasions to ascertain the status of her claim. Respondent failed to return most of these calls. When complainant was able to reach respondent, he assured her that everything \u201cwas fine.\u201d In February 1986, complainant contacted an attorney in Miami, Florida, where complainant had moved. That attorney called, as well as wrote, respondent to inquire about complainant\u2019s case but received no answer.\nOn April 7, 1986, respondent wrote complainant a letter explaining:\nYour case is sitting in limbo right now, but I am taking the steps to get it on the calendar as soon as possible. This requires a motion which will be filed this week. It will be several weeks before a date is set, but I will be in touch with you before then.\nRespondent apologized for the delay, attributing it to personal problems. After receiving the letter, complainant retained Steven M. Pavsner, an attorney in the District of Columbia, to assist in determining the status of her claim. Pavsner reviewed the court jacket and discovered that the case had been dismissed with prejudice.\nOn May 9, 1986, Pavsner wrote to respondent, indicating he would give respondent ten days to seek vacation of the judgment. Approximately five days later, Pavsner spoke by telephone with respondent, who asked for a little more time to complete his work. Respondent, however, never filed a motion to vacate. On May 22, 1986, Pavsner filed a malpractice action for complainant against respondent in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was settled in February 1987.\nII.\nOn July 3,- 1986, Bar Counsel, who had learned of complainant\u2019s lawsuit, wrote to respondent about complainant\u2019s allegations of misconduct. On April 29, 1987, respondent replied, through counsel, that \u201cextreme depression and a personal decline\u201d had \u201cimpaired his ability to conduct his law practice.\u201d\nBar Counsel filed a petition instituting formal disciplinary proceedings, alleging that respondent had violated four Disciplinary Rules, as summarized by the Board:\nA. Rule 6-101(A)(3), for neglect of a legal matter by allowing a suit which Respondent had filed on behalf of [complainant] to be dismissed for failure to place the cause at issue and by failing to take any action to reinstate the matter.\nB. Rule 7-101(A)(l), for an intentional failure to achieve his client\u2019s lawful objectives by taking no action on behalf of [complainant] after Respondent had been given several opportunities to do so.\nC. Rule 1-102(A)(4), for conduct involving misrepresentation by stating to his client that her case was still pending when, in fact, it had been dismissed.\nD. Rule 2-110(B)(3), for failure to withdraw from his representation of [complainant] when Respondent knew that his mental or physical condition rendered it unreasonably difficult for him to carry out his employment on behalf of [complainant].\nThe Hearing Committee found clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated the first three disciplinary rules as charged (but not the fourth).\nIn evaluating respondent\u2019s emotional state in mitigation of sanction, the Hearing Committee considered letters in the record from two psychiatrists: Dr. Eleanor A. Sor-rentino, respondent\u2019s therapist, and Dr. Thomas Goldman, Bar Counsel\u2019s retained expert. Both professionals agreed that respondent had been suffering from chronic depression. Dr. Goldman described respondent\u2019s condition as\ncharacterized by low mood, suicidal ideas without serious suicidal intent, social withdrawal, general disorganization with distinct self-punitive trends, (for example failure to file CJA vouchers for payment for work already completed) and difficulty maintaining his interest and concentration on his legal practice resulting in acts of omission etc., despite a conscious attitude of wishing to do a good job and a generally clear understanding of what his responsibilities are.\nBoth doctors agreed that, despite this condition, respondent was still able to practice law, although both stressed the need for continued psychiatric counselling and professional monitoring.\nAs for the connection between respondent\u2019s emotional condition and his professional misconduct, Dr. Sorrentino wrote: \u201cIn my professional opinion, Mr. Peek\u2019s failure to act in a timely manner in his client\u2019s behalf in [complainant\u2019s] case stemmed directly from his acute depressed state.\u201d Dr. Goldman offered no opinion as to the causal nexus between respondent\u2019s condition and his disciplinary violations. The Committee made no findings as to the causal nexus between respondent\u2019s depressed state and his disciplinary violations, other than to reject any argument that respondent\u2019s condition had rendered him wholly unable to perform his professional duties.\nAs to sanction, both Bar Counsel and counsel for respondent favored a two-year period of supervised probation. Bar Counsel acknowledged that \u201cno attorney suffering from an emotional disability (as opposed to alcoholism) has ever been placed on probation in this jurisdiction\u201d but argued, nonetheless, that respondent would be an appropriate candidate for probation. While agreeing that this was an appropriate case for probation, the Committee believed that respondent\u2019s previous disciplinary record, coupled with a lack of contrition for his actions in complainant\u2019s ease, indicated the need for a brief period of actual suspension from practice.\nThe Hearing Committee, therefore, recommended a thirty-day suspension, followed by an additional two-year period of suspension to be stayed on two conditions: that respondent continue to receive psychotherapy from Dr. Sorrentino throughout the period of probation unless medically terminated earlier by Dr. Sorrentino, and that respondent meet with a lawyer designated to monitor his practice not less than biweekly during the period of probation. Both respondent and Bar Counsel consented to the Hearing Committee\u2019s recommended disposition, and neither filed an objection with the Board.\nThe Board agreed with the Committee\u2019s findings that respondent had violated Disciplinary Rules 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), and 1-102(A)(4) but differed with the Committee as to the appropriate sanction. The Board compared respondent\u2019s misconduct to the misconduct in In re Dory, 528 A.2d 1247 (D.C.1987). Dory was a straightforward case: neglect of a legal matter entrusted to the attorney, failure to seek a client\u2019s lawful objectives, and failure to carry out an employment contract. There, the Board recommended, and we imposed, a thirty-day suspension. In the present case, however, the Board reasoned that, because of the added element of misrepresentation involved, respondent\u2019s transgressions warranted a stiffer penalty than the thirty days assessed in Dory. The misrepresentation in this case did not appear as extreme to the Board as the misrepresentation at issue in In re Reback, 513 A.2d 226 (D.C.1986) (en banc), where we imposed a six-month suspension for counsel\u2019s attempt to cover up neglect by forging the client\u2019s name on a substitute complaint and then lying about the signature in order to have the forged complaint notarized. Accordingly, after reviewing Dory, Reback, and other cases, the Board unanimously agreed that, absent the emotional disability factor, respondent\u2019s conduct warranted a four-month suspension.\nIII.\nThe next question \u2014 how respondent\u2019s emotional difficulties should affect the disposition of this case, if at all \u2014 created a division within the Board. All nine members agreed that diagnosable chronic depression could be a mitigating factor if expert testimony demonstrated a causal relationship between the depression and the ethical default. A Board majority found that causal nexus here; two members did not. As a consequence, the Board majority accepted respondent\u2019s depression as a mitigating factor, recommending that we stay two of the four months of suspension and impose a two-year period of probation along the lines proposed by respondent\u2019s counsel, by Bar Counsel, by Drs. Sorrenti-no and Goldman, and by the Hearing Committee. The Board minority, finding no basis for mitigation, voted to leave the four-month suspension intact and, in addition, to impose the two-year probation.\nIn evaluating whether chronic depression should serve as a mitigating factor, the Board looked for guidance in In re Kersey, 520 A.2d 321 (D.C.1987), where the respondent was disbarred but the sanction was stayed pending satisfactory completion of a five-year period of supervised probation. In Kersey, this court concluded that, when an attorney cites alcoholism in mitigation of a disciplinary sanction, the attorney must show that but for alcoholism, the misconduct would not have occurred. Id. at 327. To make such a showing the attorney must demonstrate that his or her professional conduct was \u201csubstantially affected by ... alcoholism.\u201d Id. at 326. See also In re Miller, 553 A.2d 201, 203 (D.C.1984) (attorney must show by preponderance of the evidence that alcoholism substantially affected charged misconduct).\nIn the present case, the Board recognized that the Hearing Committee had not made a finding that respondent\u2019s depression substantially affected his professional conduct. In accepting the proposal for probation, therefore, the Board majority identified five factors in the record which, in its view, \u201ccan serve as a legal surrogate of a specific finding under the Kersey \u2018but for\u2019 test of causation for purposes of imposing a period of probation in lieu of all or part of the suspension that the misconduct would otherwise warrant.\u201d The majority expressed a concern, however, that by tacking probation onto a period of suspension, the Hearing Committee essentially had treated evidence of respondent\u2019s medical condition \u2014 introduced in mitigation \u2014 as an aggravating factor instead, using probation as an additional, not lesser, sanction. The majority, therefore, sought to achieve mitigation, despite the lengthy probation, by recommending a stay of two of the four months of suspension provided the latter two months of suspension would be reinstated if respondent violated his probation. The majority recognized that \u201cthe proposed sanction of two months\u2019 actual suspension plus two years of probation may be viewed by many attorneys ... as a more onerous sanction than four months\u2019 suspension without probation,\u201d but the majority premised this recommendation on the fact that \u201cboth Bar Counsel and respondent have consented to the recommended bifurcated sanction.\u201d Neither respondent nor Bar Counsel filed any exception to the Board majority\u2019s recommendation.\nTwo members of the Board did not agree with the majority\u2019s findings of causation. More specifically, they did not find the two therapists\u2019 letters persuasive evidence that respondent\u2019s depression substantially affected his professional conduct. Consequently, the Board minority recommended against staying a portion of respondent\u2019s four-month suspension. The minority acknowledged, however, that there was record evidence that respondent \u201chas and continues to suffer from emotional problems, and that such problems have potential to affect his law practice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Board minority, therefore, also recommended a two-year period of supervised probation in addition to the suspension.\nIV.\nDistrict of Columbia Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 7(3) provides the appropriate standard for our review of the Board\u2019s Report and Recommendation:\n[T]he Court shall accept the findings of fact made by the Board unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence of record, and shall adopt the recommended disposition of the Board unless to do so would foster a tendency toward inconsistent dispositions for comparable conduct or otherwise would be unwarranted.\nSee In re Smith, 403 A.2d 296, 302-03 (D.C.1979).\nIn the usual case, the Hearing Committee makes factual findings and the Board reviews those findings. See D.C.Bar R. XI, \u00a7\u00a7 4(3)(c), 4(3)(g), 5(2)(c), 7(2), 7(3). In this case, however, the Board, not the Hearing Committee, made the critical factual finding: that respondent\u2019s chronic depression substantially affected his professional conduct. The Board clearly has authority to find facts. D.C.Bar R. XI, \u00a7 4(3)(g) gives the Board the power \u201c[t]o review the findings and recommendations of hearing committees ... and to prepare and forward its own findings and recommendations ... to this Court.\u201d When making its own factual findings, moreover, the Board must rely on \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d the same standard that governs the Hearing Committees. D.C. Court of Appeals Disciplinary Digest, Board Rules ch. 13.6 (1988) (hereafter \u201cBoard Rules\u201d), see also Smith, 403 A.2d at 302.\nAs a preliminary matter, we agree with the Board\u2019s unanimous recommendation that, absent consideration of respondent\u2019s emotional condition, the misconduct at issue warrants a four-month suspension. The Board properly applied the relevant factors, including (1) the seriousness of respondent\u2019s neglect, see In re Knox, 441 A.2d 265 (D.C.1982), (2) the presence of misrepresentation or dishonesty, see In re Haupt, 422 A.2d 768 (D.C.1980), (3) respondent\u2019s attitude toward the underlying misconduct, see In re Lieber, 442 A.2d 153 (D.C.1982), (4) prior disciplinary violations, see In re Roundtree, 467 A.2d 143, 147-48 (D.C.1980), and (5) mitigating circumstances, see In re Willcher, 404 A.2d 185 (D.C.1979). The Board\u2019s references to previously reported cases makes clear that this sanction will not \u201cfoster a tendency toward inconsistent dispositions for comparable conduct....\u201d D.C.Bar R. XI, \u00a7 7(3).\nWe conclude, moreover, that the Board majority\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent\u2019s misconduct was substantially affected by his mental problems\u201d is supported by substantial evidence of record. See id.; Smith, 403 A.2d at 303. Both therapists who offered evidence agreed that respondent suffers from chronic depression. Furthermore, there appears to be no dispute that respondent experienced a particularly acute period of depression during the time in question. Respondent\u2019s letter of April 7, 1986, to his neglected client attributed his delay in her case to personal problems. More significantly, the record contains a letter from respondent\u2019s psychiatrist offering her professional opinion that respondent\u2019s acutely depressed state caused his professional neglect.\nIt would have been better if the psychiatric testimony had been live and subject to cross-examination and to examination by a Hearing Committee that addressed the causal nexus issue. As it turned out, the Board had to engage in fact-finding, and not all members of the Board were satisfied that the letters from the psychiatrists were convincing on the crucial question of causation. Nonetheless, given the fact that respondent, Bar Counsel, and a majority of the Board were satisfied with the proffered psychiatric testimony, we are comfortable \u2014 in this particular case \u2014 with the proof presented. Other cases, however, may not be uncontroverted and thus may require more substantial proof.\nWe therefore must consider whether the Board\u2019s sustainable finding of a causal nexus between respondent\u2019s depression and his misconduct warrants a stay of all or part of the four-month suspension, coupled with a period of supervised probation for two years.\nV.\nRespondent has not contested the proposed stay, coupled with imposition of a two-year probation (including monitoring by medical and professional experts). We are required, nonetheless, to review its suitability. See D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 7(3). Furthermore, this is the first instance, other than a case of reciprocal discipline, where the Board has recommended a term of probation that exceeds the period of suspension which would otherwise be imposed. Cf. In re Kersey, 520 A.2d 321 (D.C.1987) (imposing five-year probation in lieu of non-permanent disbarment).\nWe agree with the concern of the Board majority that a lengthy period of probation in addition to, or even in lieu of, a shorter period of suspension may amount to a greater, not a lesser, sanction. The question, then, is how, if at all, a lengthy period of probation can properly be used to reflect mitigation (in contrast with enhancement) of sanction for a disciplinary violation.\nWith respect to diagnosable, chronic depression we conclude as a general rule, first, that unless a causal nexus can be shown between the depression and the misconduct, the depression can be used neither in mitigation, cf. Kersey, nor for enhancement, see D.C.Bar R. XI \u00a7 3(7), of sanction. If a causal .connection is not shown, depression that is insufficient for mitigation cannot be sufficient for a sanction, such as probation, imposed in addition to the maximum sanction that otherwise would be warranted. For this reason, the Board minority\u2019s recommendation \u2014 the four-month suspension required for the misconduct plus a two-year, supervised probation based merely on the \u201cpotential\u201d impact of respondent\u2019s depression on his practice of law \u2014 is unacceptable.\nWe conclude, second, that when, as in this case, the respondent himself proffers evidence of chronic depression at the time of the alleged misconduct and consents to the recommended probation, we can appropriately approve an extended, supervised period of probation in lieu of all or part of a shorter period of suspension. Absent objection, we cannot conclude that a respondent attorney will be aggrieved by a long probationary term that affords an obvious advantage: the continuation or early resumption of a law practice that otherwise would be suspended.\nWe reserve for another day various questions about the use of probation in a disciplinary proceeding, pursuant to the amended D.C.Bar R. XI \u00a7 3(a)(7), to increase the sanction, over objection, beyond the sanction that otherwise would be indicated. We note the possible interplay between the use of probation \u201cin lieu of, or in addition to, any other disciplinary sanction,\u201d id., and the use of probation in connection with a disability proceeding, see id. \u00a7 13(c); Board Rules ch. 14.6(a)(3) (providing for Bar Counsel to seek court-ordered suspension or probation pursuant to D.C.Bar R. XI \u00a7 16(3) [amended Rule XI \u00a7 13(c)] with documentary proof that attorney is incapacitated by \u201cdisability or addiction\u201d).\nOn this record and analysis, we order that respondent, Harold B. Peek, be suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for a period of four months, effective thirty days from the date of this order. Execution of the final two months of this suspension shall be stayed, provided respondent complies with the following conditions of probation for a period of two years beginning on the effective date of his resumption of practice after the initial two months of suspension:\n1. Supervision of respondent\u2019s professional conduct by a practice monitor \u2014 selected by the Board on Professional Responsibility \u2014 sufficient to make reasonable determinations at appropriate intervals that respondent is not neglecting any legal matter entrusted to him or attempting to conceal any such prior neglect. At the beginning of each calendar quarter year, the practice monitor will submit to the Board Office (Executive Attorney) a progress report on respondent\u2019s professional conduct.\n2. Counselling by Dr. Eleanor A. Sor-rentino (or other medical expert acceptable to the Board on Professional Responsibility) on a weekly basis, or less frequently if so recommended by such medical expert, who will in any event submit monthly reports to the Board Office (Executive Attorney) concerning respondent\u2019s participation and progress in such counselling.\nWe further order that the Executive Attorney of the Board submit a copy of each monitor\u2019s report to Bar Counsel and to the Lawyer Counselling Committee of the District of Columbia Bar. If either monitor reports, or if Bar Counsel alleges, or if the Lawyer Counselling Committee advises the Board Office, that there is reasonable cause to believe a violation of any of the above terms of probation has occurred, the Board on Professional Responsibility shall promptly convene an evidentiary hearing before a Hearing Committee with directions to submit a report to the Board as soon as practicable. If the Board finds any violation of the terms of probation, the probation shall be revoked immediately and the previously stayed two months\u2019 suspension shall be reinstated and become effective ten days after the date the Board submits to the court its report that respondent has violated the terms of probation.\nIn the event that respondent were to violate his probation, this order shall be without prejudice to Bar Counsel\u2019s instituting proceedings pursuant to amended Rule XI \u00a7 13(c) (attorneys who may be incapacitated).\nSo ordered.\n. Bar Counsel proposed that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, that the entire period of the suspension should be stayed, and that respondent should be placed on probation for two years.\n. Previously, respondent had received two informal admonitions: one involving neglect, the other involving loss of client documents and failure to return papers when requested.\n.Dory had repaid the client\u2019s $500 retainer after the Board had included restitution in the recommended sanction.\n. The Board\u2019s recommendation as to probation read, in part, as follows:\n2. Execution of the final two months of suspension is hereby stayed contingent upon Respondent\u2019s continued compliance with all applicable conditions of probation set forth in paragraph 3 below.\n3. Respondent is hereby placed on probation for a period of two years commencing on the effective date of Respondent's suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 above.\n(Emphasis added.) We assume the Board meant to say that probation commences on the effective date of the stay of respondent\u2019s suspension, i.e., on the date when respondent resumes practice. To read the Board\u2019s report as recommending that respondent be placed on probation at the same time he is ordered to begin his suspension would be contrary to the normal understanding that probation is in lieu of another sanction. Furthermore, one of the two recommended conditions of probation is professional monitoring, which cannot possibly take place while respondent is suspended from practice.\n. The Board listed the following factors:\n(1) Respondent has received treatment over a number of years for chronic depression; (2) Respondent\u2019s misconduct in this case occurred in a period during which his depression was severe and was not under control; (3) Respondent\u2019s doctor concluded that \"his failure to act in a timely manner in [complainant's] case stemmed directly from his acute depressed state\u201d; (4) both medical experts who provided evidence in this proceeding believe that Respondent\u2019s depression is now sufficiently under control to allow him to practice law responsibly; and (5) the Hearing Committee recommended, and both Bar Counsel and Respondent have accepted by consent, a period of probation with conditions related to Respondent\u2019s medical problems.\n.D.C.Bar R.
