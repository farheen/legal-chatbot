        "text": "TERRY, Associate Judge:\nPetitioner seeks review of a decision by the Director of the District of Columbia Department of Employment Services (DOES) denying her claim for workers\u2019 compensation. Petitioner sought benefits for emotional injuries which she allegedly sustained while she was employed by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in a program in which she was assigned to work at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At the administrative hearing on her claim, petitioner asserted that stressful working conditions at the EPA had caused her severe physical and emotional problems, including depression, anxiety, headaches, and diarrhea, and had aggravated the hypertension from she was previously suffering. The DOES hearing examiner concluded that there was \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about petitioner\u2019s employment at the EPA which would have caused these ailments (or aggravated the existing hypertension) in an average person, that petitioner was \u201cpredisposed\u201d to depression, and that only a person so predisposed would have been adversely affected by the work environment at the EPA. Consequently, the hearing examiner denied petitioner\u2019s claim for benefits, and the Director of DOES affirmed that denial. Before this court petitioner contends that the hearing examiner and the Director misapplied the legal standard governing the compensability of employment-related emotional injuries, made inadequate factual findings, and misapplied the presumption of compensability contained in our workers\u2019 compensation statute. Finding these contentions to be without merit, we affirm.\nI\nIn April 1989 Aquilla Sturgis was hired by AARP to work at the EPA as a technical administrative assistant, under a program run by AARP in which persons over the age of fifty-five are placed in jobs at the EPA. Ms. Sturgis was assigned to the Chemical Screening Branch of the EPA\u2019s Office of Toxic Substances. At the hearing below she testified that, from her first day on the job, the conditions of her employment at the EPA caused her to experience significant stress, which she attributed to a variety of sources. It stemmed, in part, from the fact that she was inadequately trained for her duties and was given work which she felt was demeaning. For example, she testified that on the day she began work the office secretary started a two-week vacation. As a result, Ms. Sturgis was left alone in the office with no guidance as to office procedures and was given responsibility for work ordinarily done by the secretary. Her stress also resulted, in part, from the fact that she was criticized for poor work performance. On this point she testified that the branch chief of her office frequently left notes on her desk which were unfairly critical of her work, spoke to her in a condescending fashion, and refused to give her work assignments commensurate with her job description and professional skills.\nMs. Sturgis testified that her health began to deteriorate after she had worked about six weeks at the EPA. In her view, the stressful circumstances of her employment caused a variety of emotional problems, such as depression, memory loss, exhaustion, \u201canxiety attacks,\u201d and a general inability to \u201ccope with anything.\u201d This stress, she said, had physical symptoms as well, including headaches and diarrhea, and aggravated her existing hypertension. She attributed these problems entirely to the stress she felt while working at the EPA. She testified that, because of these problems, she has been unable to work since her separation from employment at the EPA.\nAfter approximately three months on the job, Ms. Sturgis was fired at the request of the EPA office branch chief for \u201cperformance deficiencies, unprofessional behavior, and personally threatening behavior toward individuals at [EPA].\u201d Thereafter she sought medical treatment for her emotional and physical problems from an internist, two psychiatrists, and a psychologist-in-training. Written reports from all four of these persons were introduced into evidence at the administrative hearing.\nDr. Thomas Gaitor, an internist with the Howard University Family Health Center, opined that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 \u201cmajor problem\u201d was anxiety and depression. Dr. Gaitor did not express any opinion, however, as to whether there was any causal relationship between her condition and her employment at the EPA; indeed, he gave no opinion at all concerning the cause of her condition. Dr. Judith Nowak, a psychiatrist, concluded that Ms. Sturgis was suffering from a \u201cmajor depressive disorder,\u201d but concluded that this disorder did not arise out of her employment at the EPA. Another psychiatrist, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Marco T. Antonio, was of the view that Ms. Sturgis suffered from \u201canxiety-depressive reaction with poor coping mechanism,\u201d coupled with \u201cessential hypertension.\u201d The hypertension, he said, \u201cmay have been aggravated by stress at work,\u201d but that stress was \u201cnot the cause of her elevated blood pressure reading.\u201d Finally, Craig Uehiyama, a psychology intern at Howard University Hospital, opined that Ms. Sturgis exhibited symptoms of both depression and a delusional disorder, and concluded that she required \u201clong-term ego-supportive psychotherapy.\u201d Mr. Uchi-yama, like Dr. Gaitor, did not express an opinion as to whether there was any causal relationship between her condition and her employment at the EPA.\nThe employer (AARP) and its insurance carrier (Home Insurance Company) have contested Ms. Sturgis\u2019 entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation at all stages of this litigation. Jack Everett, the field coordinator for the employment program at AARP through which Ms. Sturgis was placed at the EPA, testified about her performance problems at the EPA and the events surrounding her eventual termination. Also testifying on the employer\u2019s behalf was Dr. Brian Schulman, a psychiatrist who examined Ms. Sturgis in July 1990 at the employer\u2019s request. Dr. Schulman concluded that Ms. Sturgis was not clinically depressed, that she did not have any cognitive or mental deficiency, and that she was not \u201cfunctionally or organically impaired,\u201d i.e., that she did not suffer from an \u201cactive, acute psychiatric illness.\u201d He did conclude, however, that Ms. Sturgis had \u201ca volatile temper\u201d and that she might have a \u201cborderline personality disorder with paranoid features,\u201d causing her to have \u201cdifficulty modulating her internal aggression and [to become] very angry and enraged with perhaps little provocation.\u201d He testified further that \u201cmost of [her] intense visceral or behavioral, emotional reactions were generated out of her personality\u201d and were triggered by normal everyday events of office life, \u201cthings that might happen in a busy office.\u201d On the basis of these findings, he concluded that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 work at the EPA did not, from a medical standpoint, cause the emotional problems about which she had testified.\nIn her compensation order the hearing examiner found Ms. Sturgis\u2019 testimony credible, but nevertheless concluded that her injuries were not compensable. Citing an earlier DOES case, Dailey v. 3M Co., H & AS No. 85-259 (May 19, 1988), the examiner said that for an emotional injury to be compensable, whether it is a new injury or an aggravation of a pre-existing condition, \u201cthe claimant must show that the actual conditions of employment as determined by an objective standard, and not merely the claimant\u2019s subjective perception of her working conditions, were the cause of her emotional injury.\u201d After briefly summarizing the medical evidence, the examiner concluded that this evidence established that Ms. Sturgis \u201cwas predisposed to depression\u201d and that \u201cthere was nothing unusual or uncommon about [her] work conditions which would cause a person not predisposed to become stressed.\u201d Thus the hearing examiner held that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 claim was not compensable because \u201cher current condition did not arise out of and in the course of [her] employment.\u201d\nFollowing an administrative appeal, the Director of DOES affirmed the decision of the hearing examiner. The Director specifically concurred in the examiner\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 problems at the EPA stemmed entirely from \u201cordinary employment tasks such as answering the telephone, performance evaluations, eonversa-tions with co-employees, and xeroxing\u201d and that there was \u201cno actual evidence of an uncommon or unusual stimulus at work which would cause an emotional injury under the objective standard [adopted by DOES in Dailey\nII\nMs. Sturgis contends that the hearing examiner erred in three respects in concluding that her injuries were not compensable under the District\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation act, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-301 to 36-345 (1988). She argues that the hearing examiner (1) failed to apply the correct legal standard for assessing the compensability of stress-related injuries, and erred further in failing to determine \u201cwhether [her] working conditions aggravated her pre-existing disorder,\u201d (2) failed to make adequate factual findings based on the medical evidence, and (3) failed to apply the statutory presumption of compensability. We shall address each argument in turn.\nA. Workers\u2019 compensation for emotional injuries\nTo be compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation act, an injury must be either \u201can \u2018accidental\u2019 injury that \u2018arise[s] out of and in the course of employment\u2019 or an 'occupational disease or infection\u2019 that 'arises naturally out of such employment or as naturally or unavoidably results from such accidental injury.\u2019 \u201d McEvily v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 500 A.2d 1022, 1023 n. 2 (D.C.1985) (quoting D.C.Code \u00a7 36-301(12)). Emotional injuries resulting from job stress are, under certain circumstances, compensable \u201caccidental injuries\u201d under the statute. Spartin v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 584 A.2d 564, 569 (D.C.1990); accord, Porter v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 625 A.2d 886, 888-889 (D.C.1993); Jones v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 519 A.2d 704, 708-709 (D.C.1987) (concluding that \u201caccidental injury\u201d encompasses physical ailments, such as a heart attack, triggered by emotional stressors). The test for distinguishing what is compensable from what is not is set forth in the Dailey opinion:\nClaims of mental injury cover a broad spectrum_ On one end of the spectrum are cases typified by a situation where a worker claims an emotional injury caused by a dramatic/traumatic event at work that would reasonably be expected to result in an emotional impairment to a person of ordinary sensibilities. As an example, a worker who witnesses a co-worker being grisly [sic ] dismembered and killed by a piece of machinery could be reasonably expected to sustain a disabling emotional impairment. On the opposite end of the spectrum are cases typified by a situation where a worker imagines events or conditions at work which while real to the worker would appear to be mere figments of the worker\u2019s imagination to a neutral objective and reasonable person. The former category of cases are rather clearly compensable, the latter are not.\nDailey v. 3M Co., supra, at 12 n. 4 (emphasis added).\nThe compensability of emotional injuries is determined by an \u201cobjective standard,\u201d i.e., the claimant must show \u201cthat the actual working conditions could have caused similar emotional injury in an individual who was not significantly predisposed to such injury.\u201d Id. at 6, quoted with approval in Spartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 568. In other words, the relevant inquiry \u201cfocuses on whether the stresses of the job were so great that they could have caused harm to the average worker.\u201d Spartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 569 (emphasis added); see Porter, supra, 625 A.2d at 889. Thus, to be successful, a claimant must establish that a particular incident or situation at work was a significant stressor that could reasonably be expected to affect a person of ordinary sensibilities in the same way that it affected the claimant. See Spartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 569 (claimant must demonstrate that \u201ccurrent job conditions are unusually stressful as compared to employment conditions in general\u201d); McEvily, supra, 500 A.2d at 1023-1024 (upholding denial of benefits based on evidence that employee was predisposed to depression, and that there was no \u201csignificant stressor that would have affected anyone who was not so predisposed\u201d).\nMs. Sturgis contends that the objective standard approved in Spartin was misapplied by DOES. She maintains that both the hearing examiner and the Director of DOES addressed only whether she was predisposed to the injuries she sustained and failed to determine whether the \u201caverage\u201d worker would have been similarly affected by the \u201charassment\u201d she experienced at work. We find no basis for this complaint. Both the hearing examiner and the Director specifically found that the events described by Ms. Sturgis as causing the stress that she experienced, which were accepted as true without qualification, would not have produced similarly traumatizing consequences in an average person. For example, the Director concluded that the injurious stress Ms. Sturgis experienced at the EPA stemmed entirely from \u201cordinary employment tasks such as answering the telephone, performance evaluations, conversations with co-employees, and xeroxing\u201d and that there was \u201cno actual evidence of an uncommon or unusual stimulus at work which would cause an emotional injury under the objective [Dailey ] standard.\u201d This conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. Similarly, the hearing examiner\u2019s findings specifically detailed the events which Ms. Sturgis contended caused her stress. The examiner concluded, however, that \u201cthere was nothing unusual or uncommon about [her] work conditions which would cause a person not predisposed to become stressed.\u201d\nBoth the testimony of Ms. Sturgis, identifying the types of \u201charassment\u201d she experienced, and the testimony of Dr. Schul-man, which also catalogued the events Ms. Sturgis had described to him as stressful, established that normal everyday events of office life triggered what Dr. Schulman characterized as \u201cintense visceral or behavioral, emotional reactions,\u201d which in turn caused the harmful stress she experienced. Moreover, Dr. Schulman specifically testified that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 reactions to these events stemmed from her \u201cpersonality type.\u201d He stated that, in his opinion, an average person would not suffer similar afflictions resulting from these events and, consequently, would not experience the stress of which Ms. Sturgis complained. Given this record, we cannot accept Ms. Sturgis\u2019 contention that the hearing examiner and the Director failed to consider whether an average person would have been similarly traumatized by the same events that adversely affected her.\nMs. Sturgis also maintains that the hearing examiner erred in failing to determine \u201cwhether [her] working conditions aggravated her pre-existing disorder,\u201d i.e., her depression and hypertension, and whether that aggravation was compen-sable. We find no error in the failure to make such findings. Ms. Sturgis is correct that, as a general proposition, emotional injuries which result from the aggravation of an existing condition may be compensa-ble under the workers\u2019 compensation act:\nUnder Dailey, an employee predisposed to psychic injury [can] recover if [she] is exposed to work conditions so stressful that a normal employee might have suffered similar injury. Thus an employee with a predisposition to mental illness is not precluded from recovering under Dailey.\nSpartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 570 (emphasis added). As this passage makes plain, however, the standard by which compensability is determined remains, like the standard for assessing ordinary claims for emotional injuries, an objective one. See id. at 568.\nEven though aggravation of a preexisting condition may be compensable, it was not error in this case to fail to make findings on this aspect of Ms. Sturgis\u2019 claim. As we have observed, before a claimant is entitled to compensation for an \u201caccidental injury,\u201d he or she must establish that the work event or condition at issue was the cause of the claimed injury. In the words of the statute, the claimant must establish that the injury for which compensation is sought arose \u201cout of and in the course of employment....\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 36-301(12). The hearing examiner found that Ms. Sturgis was \u201cpredisposed to depression\u201d and that a person not predisposed to depression would not have been similarly affected by the work environment at the EPA. From these findings she concluded that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 \u201ccurrent condition did not arise out of and in the course of [her] employment.\u201d This legal conclusion obviated any findings on Ms. Sturgis\u2019 claim for compensation based on aggravation of her pre-existing conditions. In the words of the Dailey opinion, \u201cto say that one\u2019s working conditions have aggravated a pre-existing condition presupposes that legal causation has already been established between the pre-existing condition and the injury which is attributed to the employment conditions; but in this case, legal causation was never established.\u201d Dailey, supra, at 9. Thus the failure of the examiner and the Director to make factual findings concerning aggravation of Ms. Sturgis\u2019 pre-existing conditions was not error.\nB. Sufficiency of the findings\nMs. Sturgis next challenges the hearing examiner\u2019s findings in three respects. She contends first that the findings are inconsistent and incorrectly interpret the medical evidence. This contention is based on the mistaken belief that the compensation order fails to reconcile Ms. Sturgis\u2019 testimony that she was \u201charassed\u201d with the examiner\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[n]othing unusual or uncommon happened at [Ms. Sturgis\u2019] employment which led to her current depression.\u201d The hearing examiner\u2019s decision to credit the factual content of Ms. Sturgis\u2019 testimony did not bind her to conclude that the things that happened to Ms. Sturgis at the EPA constituted \u201charassment.\u201d In any event, whether the acts of which she complained amounted to \u201charassment\u201d was irrelevant to the compensation decision because compensability does not depend on \u201cthe claimant\u2019s subjective perception of [her] working conditions-\u201d Spartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 568 (quoting Dailey, supra, at 5).\nMs. Sturgis\u2019 second argument is that the hearing examiner incorrectly interpreted the medical evidence. Even if that were true, such a \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d would be of no moment. The central inquiry under Spartin, after all, is whether an average person would have been similarly affected (i.e., injured) by the same conduct. Regardless of how Ms. Sturgis was diagnosed, there was substantial evidence that the injuries she suffered would not have been suffered by an average person exposed to the same work situation.\nFinally, Ms. Sturgis asserts that the hearing examiner erred in failing to indicate which portions of the medical evidence she credited. Our decisions do not require hearing examiners to inventory the evidence and explain in detail why a particular part of it is accepted or rejected. See Citizens Ass\u2019n of Georgetown v. District of Columbia Zoning Commission, 402 A.2d 36, 42 (D.C.1979). Sufficiency of findings is assessed in a less formalistic fashion; we examine whether the findings are detailed enough \u201cto allow a reviewing court to conclude that the decision \u2018followed] rationally from the findings\u2019 of fact.\u201d Spartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 571 (citation omitted). The findings in this case satisfy that standard.\nC. The presumption of compensability\nMs. Sturgis\u2019 final argument is that she was not given the benefit of the presumption of compensability applicable to claims made under the workers\u2019 compensation act. In the District of Columbia, injuries suffered by a worker on the job are presumed by statute to be compensable. D.C.Code \u00a7 36-321(1); see, e.g., Dunston v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 509 A.2d 109, 111 (D.C.1986). This presumption operates to \u201cestablish a causal connection between the disability and the work-related event.\u201d Baker v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 611 A.2d 548, 550 (D.C.1992). \u201cTo defeat a claim for compensation, the employer must rebut the presumption of compensability by offering evidence that the claim is not one \u2018arising out of and in the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d Dunston, supra, 509 A.2d at 111 (citations omitted); see also 4934, Inc. v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 605 A.2d 50, 57 (D.C.1992) (discussing purpose of presumption).\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that the presumption of compensa-bility was not properly applied. The evidence was essentially uncontroverted that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 condition did not arise out of or in the course of her employment. Neither Dr. Gaitor nor Mr. Uchiyama expressed any opinion on causation, and Dr. Nowak, Dr. Antonio, and Dr. Schulman all concluded that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 job situation was not a cause of her injuries. The examiner wrote in her order that Ms. Sturgis had not \u201cset forth sufficient evidence to meet her burden of establishing that the conditions of the work caused the stress which she now alleges made her disabled.\u201d This remark reflects no more than the hearing examiner\u2019s legal conclusion that the employer had rebutted the presumption, and that Ms. Sturgis was unable to overcome that showing. We agree, and hold that the evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption.\nThe final order of the Director of DOES is accordingly\nAffirmed.\n. For example, Dr. Schulman explained that, in his view, the problems she experienced at work stemmed from \u201cher own identity and her perception of herself as a professional person....\u201d When things occurred at work which she perceived to be in conflict with that identity,\nher emotional response to that was to get very angry and to have what I characterize as temper tantrums, which are consistent with this type of a personality, where she would become easily overwhelmed, get very angry, perhaps inappropriately angry at certain situations and, as a consequence of that, experience intense internal distress....\nThus, in Dr. Schulman\u2019s opinion, Ms. Sturgis had \"significant occupational problems,\u201d i.e., \"problems that an individual has that are not attributable to a mental disorder but are attributable to problems that people experience in the workplace.\u201d\n. Dr. Schulman also specifically disputed the conclusion reached by Mr. Uehiyama that Ms. Sturgis' work at the EPA \"aggravated\u201d her preexisting hypertension. See note 5, infra.\n. Review by this court of administrative agency decisions, including those under the workers\u2019 compensation act, is limited. See generally Lee v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 509 A.2d 100, 102 (D.C.1986). \"We cannot retry the facts or rehear the evidence. Our task is simply to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Department.... If there is, our consideration of the case is at an end.\u201d Shepherd v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 514 A.2d 1184, 1186 (D.C.1986) (citations omitted).\n. Spartin involved a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits by a man who asserted that job-related stress caused compensable emotional injuries. The employee asserted that, after the company for which he worked had merged with a larger firm, his job responsibilities grew to unmanageable proportions. He claimed that the pressure he experienced as a result of these new duties left him severely depressed, and that this depression manifested itself in suicidal thoughts, despondency, loss of memory, and an inability to concentrate. This court held that \"emotional injuries\" such as those suffered by Mr. Spartin were compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation act under certain circumstances. We expressly approved the \u201cspecial standard\u201d adopted by DOES in Dailey, noting that it was consistent with \"the modern trend to compensate workers for emotional injury caused by job stress.\" 584 A.2d at 568-569. We remanded the case to DOES after concluding, among other things, that the Dailey objective test had been misapplied because the hearing examiner had failed to consider whether Mr. Spartin's job had aggravated a pre-existing ailment and had focused excessively on his work history, rather than the stressfulness of his working conditions.\n. In any event, it is doubtful that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 pre-existing conditions were in fact aggravated by the stress she experienced at work. Her medical evidence established that she suffered from depression, a type of personality disorder. Dr. Schulman testified that a personality disorder stays with a person throughout his or her entire life, so that work-related stress cannot, in a medical sense, aggravate it. The doctor said that stress may appear to aggravate a pre-exist-ing personality disorder because, \"when people are under conditions of stress, deficits in their personality will manifest themselves. [However, the underlying] condition doesn\u2019t get worse.\" Similarly, there was substantial evidence that Ms. Sturgis\u2019 hypertension was not aggravated by the job stress she experienced. Dr. Schulman explained that hypertension is a disease and that, as such, it \"is not made worse by life stress or by exacerbation; it's a blood pressure_ [T]here's no scientific evidence that the disease is either aggravated or accelerated in its progression by the course of \u2014 by any life event or stressful event.\"\n. Section 36-321(1) provides in pertinent part: \"[I]t shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary ... [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of [the workers\u2019 compensation act]_\" See Spartin, supra, 584 A.2d at 572; Parodi v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 560 A.2d 524, 525-526 (D.C.1989); Ferreira v. District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, 531 A.2d 651, 655 (D.C.1987).",

This \u201ccredible\u201d (and presumably credited) evidence included, inter alia, the following:\n1.Ms. Sturgis completed four years of college;\n2. she was basically in good health when she started the job;\n3. in spite of her educational qualifications, she was put under the supervision of an eighteen-year-old student;\n4. she had to run errands, Xerox, get coffee, and do other menial jobs;\n5. when she protested, the person for whom she did some work \u201ctalked to me like you\u2019re talking to a dog\u201d; and\n6. one of the employer\u2019s representatives yelled at her while she was sick.\nHaving ostensibly believed all of this testimony, the hearing examiner then found that \u201cthere was nothing unusual or uncommon about claimant\u2019s work conditions which would cause a person not predisposed to become stressed.\u201d\nI question the assertion that there was \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about a middle-aged college graduate (or near-graduate) receiving the treatment described above, especially the alleged humiliations catalogued in items 3-4. Indeed, common sense suggests that a normal individual would find such experiences somewhat stressful. The examiner could reasonably find, however, that such a normal person would not have suffered the kinds of sequelae which Ms. Sturgis claims to have endured.\nThe latter point is doubtless the one which the hearing examiner intended to convey. Ms. Sturgis would not be entitled to any relief if a person of normal sensibilities would not have become emotionally impaired as a result of the events in question, and a remand for clarification of the findings would therefore serve no useful purpose.
