Upon review of the memoranda submitted, we are of the opinion that cer-tiorari is not warranted at this time. We fully anticipate, however, that the Coastal Resources Management Council will render its decision on the petitioners\u2019 pending 1967 application within a reasonable time. Thereafter, the parties may pursue whatever remedies they deem appropriate in the light of the administrative ruling.\nThe petition for writ of certiorari is denied.",
