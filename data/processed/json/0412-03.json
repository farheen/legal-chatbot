In response to the petition, the Registrar moves that the case be returned to the District Court for a new hearing, apparently acknowledging that the District Court judge mistakenly treated petitioner\u2019s appeal as a safety responsibility matter. After carefully reviewing the papers submitted to us, we believe that such a remand is appropriate.\nAccordingly, the petition for writ of cer-tiorari is granted, the judgment of the District Court is quashed, and this case is remanded to the District Court for a new hearing.",
