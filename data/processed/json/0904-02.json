McIntyre, Sr., appeals pro se from a judgment entered in the Superior Court (Kennebec County, Crowley, J.) affirming the judgment of the District Court (Waterville, Mills, J.) finding him in contempt of a court order to remove junk from his property and assessing a fine and attorney fees. There is no merit to any of his contentions and we affirm the judgment.\nThe District Court did not exceed its jurisdiction by ordering McIntyre to remove a barricade constructed to conceal the debris on his property, 30-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4452(3)(C) (Pamph.1993); see Bayley v. Bayley, 602 A.2d 1152, 1154 (Me.1992) and M.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (findings of fact shall not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous), and acted within its discretion in awarding attorney fees to the Town. See 30-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4452(3)(D). In addition, the record clearly establishes that the Town\u2019s motion for reconsideration was timely filed pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 59(e), and there are no grounds for McIntyre\u2019s claim that the trial judge was biased against him.\nBecause this appeal is frivolous, we impose sanctions pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 76(f).\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed. Charles McIntyre, Sr., shall pay to the Town $500 toward its attorney fees.\nAll concurring.",
