The order is part of a class action in which parents of pupils also ask that the town council be ordered to afford sufficient funds to maintain the school\u2019s operation. The review presently sought is piecemeal in nature. The petitioners are free to return to the Superior Court and seek an expedited hearing wherein the complete controversy can be presented for a full and final determination. Accordingly, the petitioners\u2019 request for a stay is denied and dismissed,, and their petition for certiorari is denied and dismissed.\nDORIS, J., did not participate.",
