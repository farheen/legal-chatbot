        "text": "Justice BAER,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent from this Court\u2019s entry of a per curiam Order denying Eagle I. Electrical\u2019s (Eagle) Petition for Allowance of Appeal, which is being treated as an Application for Relief pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 123. Because it is unapparent that the plain language of Section 512(b) of the Pennsylvania Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act (CASPA), 73 P.S. \u00a7 512(b), necessarily precludes an award of attorney\u2019s fees or expenses incurred in the context of appellate proceedings, I believe this Court should retain jurisdiction, grant the Application for Relief and remand this matter to the Superior Court with direction that it issue an opinion on the merits of the attorney\u2019s fee claim.\nBy way of background, Eagle was a subcontractor of J.J. Hilferty & Son Builders, Inc. (Hilferty). United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF & G) was Hilferty\u2019s surety. When Hilferty failed to pay Eagle for services rendered, Eagle filed a breach of contract action in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Eagle secured a monetary judgment against Hilferty and USF & G, and sought counsel fees and expenses pursuant to \u00a7 512(b) of CASPA, which provides as follows:\nthe substantially prevailing party in any proceeding to recover any payment under this act shall be awarded a reasonable attorney fee in an amount to be determined by the court or arbitrator, together with expenses.\nThe trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees, penalties and interest to Eagle. Both Hil-ferty and USF & G appealed to the Superior Court. The Superior Court vacated the judgment against USF & G, but affirmed the judgment against Hilferty. Hilferty sought allowance of appeal to this Court, which was denied on March 26, 2003.\nWith the litigation against Hilferty completed, Eagle filed an application for further counsel fees with the Superior Court, asserting that it was entitled, under CAS-PA, to recover attorney\u2019s fees incident to Hilferty\u2019s unsuccessful appeal to the Superior Court and petition for allowance of appeal to this Court. On May 6, 2003, the Superior Court denied Eagle\u2019s request, prompting this Application to this Court.\nThe Superior Court\u2019s order denying Eagle\u2019s application for costs and this Court\u2019s Order affirming such action could be construed to signify the Superior Court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s view that the language of Section 512(b) of CASPA precludes an award of attorney fees or expenses by an appellate court for costs incurred during appellate proceedings. Attorney\u2019s fees for appellate litigation are neither specifically mandated nor proscribed by Section 512(b). The Legislature merely provides that \u201cthe substantially prevailing party in any proceeding to recover any payment under this act shall be awarded a reasonable attorney fee in the amount to be determined by the court or arbitrator.... \u201d This language appears broad enough to encompass proceedings in appellate courts, and an award by such a court.\nIn addition to the foregoing, Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 2744 contemplates the imposition of costs inclusive of attorney fees and costs by an appellate court as specified by \u201cActs of Assembly,\u201d such as CASPA. This provision states, in relevant part\n[i]n addition to other costs allowable by general rule or Act of Assembly, an appellate court may award as further costs damages as may be just, including a reasonable counsel fee.\n(Emphasis added). While counsel fees awarded pursuant to Rule 2744 are limited to appeals that are frivolous, taken solely for delay, or where a party\u2019s conduct is dilatory, obdurate or vexatious, as noted, the Rule specifies that such fees may be imposed \u201cin addition to other costs allowable by ... Act of Assembly.\u201d Clearly, CASPA is an Act of Assembly that imposes costs including attorney fees.\nI believe the question of CASPA\u2019s applicability to appellate counsel fees and expenses is important and has not been addressed by the Pennsylvania appellate courts. Thus, I cannot join in the Court\u2019s per curiam Order affirming the Superior Court\u2019s disposition. Rather, I would grant the Application and remand the matter to the Superior Court, while retaining jurisdiction, directing that the Superior Court issue a substantive opinion disposing of the issues presented. Thereafter, we could review the merits of the issues with the benefit of the lower court\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent language. As I believe this to be the appropriate course of action, I dissent.\nJustice SAYLOR joins this dissenting statement.",
