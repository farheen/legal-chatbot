        "text": "McKUSICK, Chief Justice.\nFor approximately six years the Penob-scot Nation has been operating weekly beano games, as defined by 17 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 311(1) (1983), on the Penobscot Indian Reservation. The games are usually held on Sundays and are open to members of the general public at prices ranging up to $45 per person. An individual prize of as large as $25,000 has been awarded in a single \u201cSuper Bingo\u201d game. The weekly games draw many hundreds of players to the Pe-nobscot reservation from all over Maine and beyond. The games generate gross revenues of approximately $50,000 per month; the net profit is used to fund various tribal governmental services and programs, including snow and rubbish removal on the reservation, police and health services, and home improvement programs.\nIn October, 1982, defendants James Tier-ney and Arthur Stilphen, Maine\u2019s Attorney General and Public Safety Commissioner, respectively, advised the Penobscot Nation of their intent to move against the Nation, or its officers, employees and agents, for violating the state\u2019s beano law. The state has provided in chapter 13-A of title 17 M.R.S.A., \u00a7\u00a7 311-325 (1983), for the licensing of beano games under certain circumstances. Section 312 states,\nNo person, firm, association or corporation shall hold, conduct or operate the amusement commonly known as \u201cBeano\u201d or \u201cBingo\u201d for the entertainment of the public within the State unless a license therefor is obtained from the Chief of the State Police.\nThe Penobscot Nation has no current beano license; indeed, it admits that its game is not eligible for a license under chapter 13-A, because section 314 and 315 permit the Chief of the State Police to issue licenses only to volunteer fire departments, agricultural fair associations, and certain nonprofit organizations, as well as to \u201cbona fide resort hotels\u201d whose games return no profits to the hotels. Moreover, the Nation\u2019s games do not comply with the provision of section 312 prohibiting Sunday beano games, or with various regulations, promulgated by the Chief of the State Police pursuant to section 317, prohibiting the charging of admission fees and limiting to $200 the value of any single prize and to $1,000 the aggregate value of prizes awarded during any one occasion. Under section 325, a fine of up to $1,000 may be assessed against any \u201cperson, firm, association or corporation\u201d violating any of the provisions of chapter 13-A.\nIn December, 1982, the Nation sought from the Superior Court (Kennebec County) both a declaration that its beano game was lawful and an injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing against the tribe the provisions of Maine\u2019s beano law. The Nation argued that chapter 13-A of title 17 does not apply to it because it is neither a person, a firm, an association, nor a corporation. In support of this proposition, the tribe cited 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 6206(1) (Supp. 1982-1983), which states that the Penobscot Nation, \u201cwithin [its] Indian territories, shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, privileges, powers and immunities ... and shall be subject to all the duties, obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality .... \u201d A municipality, the Nation pointed out, has been held not to be a \u201cperson\u201d or a \u201ccorporation\u201d \u2014 at least for purposes of a wrongful death statute, Chase v. Inhabitants of Town of Litchfield, 134 Me. 122, 125, 182 A. 921, 923 (1936); and it argued that one does not ordinarily think of a municipality as a \u201cfirm\u201d or an \u201cassociation.\u201d The Penobscot Nation further asserted that even if the beano law is, by its terms, applicable to it, the game is an \u201cinternal tribal matter,\u201d which, under another provision of 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 6206(1), is \u201cnot subject to regulation by the State.\u201d The Superior Court ruled against the Nation and denied its request for an injunction, holding that 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A applies to the Penobscot Nation and that it is not shielded by 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 6206(1) from state enforcement of the beano law. We agree.\nI. The Applicability of the Beano Law\nChapter 13-A of title 17, prohibiting any \u201cperson, firm, association or corporation\u201d from operating beano games without a license, cannot be fully understood unless its history is examined. In 1943, the legislature passed P.L.1943, ch. 355, \u201cAn Act Providing for the Licensing and Regulation of the Amusement Known as Beano.\u201d Sections 1 and 7 of the 1943 act contained the precise \u201cperson, firm, association or corporation\u201d language that now appears at 17 M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 312 and 325. The original bill, L.D. 834 (91st Legis.1943), did not specify who or what could obtain a beano license; before it was passed, therefore, it was amended so as to limit licenses to fair associations and various nonprofit organizations. Speaking in favor of an early version of this amendment, Senator Brown of Aroostook said its effect would be to keep racketeers out of Maine because \u201cno one but the bona fide organizations mentioned here can run a game of Beano in the state of Maine.\u201d Legis.Rec. 1078 (1943). The next day, on the Senate floor, a later version of the amendment was debated. Senator Varney of York asked,\nIs it intended by this amendment that nobody can have a license to play Beano except those organizations already men- \u25a0 tioned?\nSenator Friend of Somerset, a proponent of. the amendment, replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Legis.Rec. 1153 (1943).\nThe history of the current beano licensing law thus demonstrates that the legislature intended that law to prohibit entirely the operation of beano games except by those entities issued valid licenses by the Chief of the State Police. The terms \u201cperson,\u201d \u201cfirm,\u201d \u201cassociation,\u201d and \u201ccorporation\u201d were used to reach every entity capable of operating a beano game. The fundamental objective in interpreting any statute is to determine the intent of the legislature in enacting it and to give effect to that intent. Cummings v. Town of Oakland, 430 A.2d 825, 829 (Me.1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1134, 102 S.Ct. 988, 71 L.Ed.2d 286 (1982). That the legislature intended to permit beano games only where licensed was recognized correctly just one year after the beano law was first enacted; the State\u2019s Attorney General then wrote, \u201cWhenever and wherever the amusement commonly known as Beano is conducted or operated \u2018for the entertainment of the public\u2019 a license must be obtained.\u201d Op.Me. Att\u2019y Gen. (1944), reprinted in 1943-44 Me. Att\u2019y Gen.Ann.Rep. 160.\nOur interpretation of the language at issue in this case is reinforced by the fact that the general gambling laws in effect when the beano law was first adopted categorically prohibited all gambling, no matter by whom conducted. R.S. ch. 136, \u00a7 18 (1930), stated, \u201cEvery ... scheme or device of chance, of whatever name or description ... is prohibited,\u201d and set penalties for \u201cwhoever is concerned therein.\u201d R.S. ch. 136, \u00a7 1 (1930), levied a fine on \u201c[w]hoever keeps or assists in keeping a gambling house,\u201d while section 2 of the same chapter provided for a fine of up to twenty dollars for \u201c[wjhoever gambles, or bets on any person gambling.\u201d In short, the state of Maine in 1943 already prohibited gambling as a general matter; the legislature in that year acted to create a limited exception for certain specific entities eligible for beano licenses. If P.L. 1943, ch. 355, the direct precursor of current 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A, were read to allow some entity to conduct beano games without a license from the Chief of the State Police, it would directly conflict with the laws prohibiting gambling by all entities capable of engaging in gambling or \u201cg'ames of chance.\u201d We will not read a statute to conflict with another statute where an alternative, reasonable interpretation yields harmony. See State v. Rand, 430 A.2d 808, 817 (Me.1981).\nThe scope of the beano law, its language having survived substantially intact since 1943, is the same today as it was when the law was enacted. 17 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 312, standing alone, therefore prohibits anyone and anything from operating a beano game \u2014 as \u201cbeano\u201d is defined in section 311(1) \u2014 without a license from the Chief of the State Police. Moreover, the state\u2019s criminal gambling laws, now codified at 17-A M.R.S.A. ch. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 951-958 (1983), declare today, just as they did in 1943, that all beano games conducted without a license are illegal. Section 952(4) defines \u201cgambling\u201d so as to include beano, and, by section 952(11), any gambling \u201cnot expressly authorized by statute\u201d is defined as \u201cunlawful.\u201d The only statute that could \u201cauthorize\u201d a beano game is 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A; in fact, section 951 of the criminal code expressly exempts from the application of the rest of chapter 39 any person licensed by the Chief of the State Police under 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A. This explicit reference to the beano law indicates that the legislature in 1975 still considered it only a limited exception to the general no-gambling rule. See 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 951 comment.\nThe definitions contained in section 952, together with the specific allusion to the beano licensing law contained in section 951, make it clear that in Maine all gambling, including beano, is still unlawful unless expressly permitted by state statute. The Penobscot Nation cannot obtain permission to conduct its beano games under 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A or any other existing state statute. Therefore, even if it were to be considered a \u201cmunicipality\u201d for purposes of the beano law, it is prohibited by section 312 of title 17 from operating those games.\nII. The Scope of the Nation\u2019s Exemption from State Law\nRelations between the Penobscot Nation, the State of Maine, and the federal government are now controlled by the federal Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-420, 94 Stat.1785, now codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1721-1735 (Supp. IV 1980) (\u201cthe federal act\u201d) and by Maine\u2019s Act to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, P.L.1979, ch. 732, \u00a7 1, now codified at 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6201-6214 (Supp. 1982-83) (\u201cthe state act\u201d). The Nation argues that by dint of 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 6206(1), which gives the tribe authority over \u201cinternal tribal matters\u201d free from state regulation, it retains all of the inherent powers that, according to federal law, are recognized as an attribute of an Indian tribe\u2019s historical quasi-sovereignty. These powers, the Nation goes on to assert, include the right to raise money for tribal government and services by operating beano games on the Penobscot Indian Reservation, even though the games would otherwise be barred by state law. We cannot accept either of these two propositions. We conclude, first, that the Nation\u2019s inherent sovereign powers would in any event not include the right to run a beano game in violation of state law, and, second, that the federal and state acts have independently defined the sphere within which the tribe can operate free of state regulation, and that beano cannot be considered an \u201cinternal tribal matter\u201d within that narrow sphere.\nA. Inherent Sovereignty\nThe concept that Indian tribes retain certain \u201coriginal natural rights,\u201d defeasible only by the federal government and not by the several states, was first articulated by Chief Justice Marshall in Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 559, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832). Using language both more sweeping and more eloquent than that found in any later judicial pronouncement, the Chief Justice held that Georgia could not convict a missionary, licensed by the federal government to preach to the Cherokee Nation, of violating a state law forbidding all white men from entering the Cherokee reservation without a permit from the governor of Georgia. \u201cThe Cherokee Nation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which the laws of Georgia can have no force ... but ... in conformity with treaties, and with acts of Congress.\u201d 31 U.S. at 561.\nThe Supreme Court in time revised its view of the scope of an Indian nation\u2019s inherent powers. In United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 381-82, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 1112-13, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886), the Court stated that Indians are regarded, in the eyes of the law, as \u201ca separate people, with the power of regulating their internal and social relations, and thus far not brought under the laws of the Union or of the State within whose limits they resided.\u201d (Emphasis added) In Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959), the Court recognized that a tribe\u2019s inherent sovereignty did not render all activities conducted on a reservation immune from state regulation or action. \u201cEssentially, absent governing acts of Congress, the question has always been whether the state action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\u201d 358 U.S. at 220, 79 S.Ct. at 271. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 148, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1270, 36 L.Ed.2d 114 (1973), summarized the precedents neatly, saying that the \u201cupshot\u201d of federal Indian law is that \u201ceven on reservations, state laws may be applied unless such application would interfere with reservation self-government or would impair a right granted or reserved by federal law.\u201d The case immediately following Mescalero in the United States reporter, McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission, 411 U.S. 164, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973), spoke specifically to the problem of state regulation of activities performed on an Indian reservation but involving non-Indians. Williams, said the Court, did not mean that Indians have an absolute right \u201cto make their own laws and live by them\u201d; rather, it provided that \u201cthe state could protect its interest up to the point where tribal self-government would be affected. 411 U.S. at 179, 93 S.Ct. at 1266.\nRecent cases have confirmed McCla-nahan \u2019s suggestion that an Indian tribe\u2019s inherent powers cannot be judged in a vacuum, but must be weighed against the interests of the state in applying its laws and regulations to the tribe.\nLong ago this Court departed from Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s view that \u201cthe laws of [a state] can have no force\u201d within reservation boundaries.... There is no rigid rule by which to resolve the question whether a particular state law may be applied to an Indian reservation or to tribal members.\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 141-42, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 2582-83, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980). In holding that the state of Arizona could not impose a motor carrier tax or a fuel-use tax on a logging company owned by non-Indians but doing business exclusively with a tribally owned sawmill on an Indian reservation, White Mountain noted that the taxes would be used to construct and maintain state roads, but that the logging company in question did not use state roads, as its operations were confined to reservation land. Therefore, said the Court, Arizona had no \u201ccompensatory purpose\u201d or \u201clegitimate regulatory interest\u201d in taxing the logging company other than the desire to raise revenue. 448 U.S. at 150, 100 S.Ct. at 2587. Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 101 S.Ct. 1245, 67 L.Ed.2d 493 (1981), agreed that the State of Montana, and not the Crow Indians, had the right to license and regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians on land inside the tribe\u2019s reservation to which the state had title. The Court stated that the Crows\u2019 inherent sovereignty included\nthe power to punish tribal offenders, ... inherent power to determine tribal membership, to regulate domestic relations among members, and to prescribe rules of inheritance for members.... But exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express congressional delegation.\n450 U.S. at 564, 101 S.Ct. at 1257-58. Regulation of non-Indian hunting and fishing on reservation land owned by non-Indians \u201cbears no close relationship to tribal self-government or internal relations,\u201d said the Court; therefore, \u201cthe general principles of retained inherent sovereignty did not authorize the Crow Tribe to adopt Resolution No. 74-05.\u201d 450 U.S. at 564-65, 101 S.Ct. at 1258.\nShifting our focus from the Court\u2019s attempts to articulate the content of an Indian tribe\u2019s retained sovereignty to its analysis of specific matters claimed to fall within a tribe\u2019s sphere of authority, we are unable to find a case on all fours with the controversy we are asked to resolve today. Although several lower federal court cases have allowed tribes to conduct beano or bingo games on their reservations in spite of state or local laws that appear facially similar to 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A, those cases were decided on the basis of specific federal statutes instead of federal Indian common law. The Supreme Court has given us relatively few decisions clearly bottomed on the concept of inherent tribal authority rather than analyses of specific treaties or federal statutes. In fact, some commentators believe that \u201cthe preemption analysis has been the only sound and consistent basis for decision,\u201d and that even in Worcester v. Georgia the Indians\u2019 right of self-government existed only \u201cbecause it had been recognized and allowed to continue in the relevant treaty.\u201d Mettler, A Unified Theory of Indian Tribal Sovereignty, 30 Hastings L.J. 89, 112-13 (1978). Under this view, the federal precedents are of little help to a court faced with a claim of inherent sovereignty by a tribe that has had little or no historical relationship with the federal government. Id. at 120-21.\nIn a handful of Supreme Court opinions, however, the Court has explained its decisions in terms of the inherent sovereignty doctrine alone. From those cases, a few points are clear. A tribe has the inherent power to try members of that tribe for crimes committed against fellow members on the reservation, United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978); Ex Parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556, 3 S.Ct. 396, 27 L.Ed. 1030 (1883), but not to try nonmembers for the same acts, Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978). Tribal sovereignty permits the regulation of hunting and fishing by non-Indians on land owned by (or held in trust for) the tribe, but not the regulation of hunting and fishing on land owned by others, even if the land lies within the borders of a reservation. Montana, 450 U.S. 544, 101 S.Ct. 1245, 67 L.Ed.2d 493. These cases involve matters that may be classified \u201cdomestic\u201d in the sense that they involve only intra-tribal relationships or regulation of Indian-owned land. See also Goldberg, A Dynamic View of Tribal Jurisdiction to Tax Non-Indians, 40 Law & Contemp.Probs. 166, 169 (1976) (\u201cEarly decisions of the United States Supreme Court proclaimed that Indians possessed all sovereign powers over domestic matters within their territorial boundaries\u201d). Recently, the Court has appeared to extend the scope of a tribe\u2019s inherent powers beyond these domestic matters, by holding that Indian tribes have some inherent power to tax.\nWashington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980), involved the state\u2019s attempt to impose its general cigarette excise tax and sales tax to cigarette sales made by reservation Indians, on the reservation, to non-Indians. The tribes themselves had adopted an ordinance imposing their own tax on reservation cigarette sales. The Court upheld both taxes, agreeing with the Indians that \u201cthe power to tax transactions occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or its members is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty,\u201d 447 U.S. at 152, 100 S.Ct. at 2081, but rejecting the Indians\u2019 contention that the state taxes are \u201cinconsistent with the principle of tribal self-government\u201d and therefore invalid as applied on the reservation. Id. at 154, 100 S.Ct. at 2082. The Court held that\nWashington does not infringe the rights of reservation Indians to \u201cmake their own laws and be ruled by them\u201d ... merely because the result of imposing taxes will be to deprive the Tribes of revenues which they currently are receiving. The principle of tribal self-government, grounded in notions of inherent sovereignty and in congressional policies, seeks an accommodation between the interests of the tribes and the Federal Government, on the one hand, and those of the State, on the other.... While the Tribes do have an interest in raising revenues for essential government programs, that interest is strongest when revenues are derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the Tribes and when the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services.\nId. at 156-57, 100 S.Ct. at 2083. Moreover, said the Court, the state taxes did not conflict with or undermine any policy behind the tribal taxes, which had no \u201cnonrevenue purposes\u201d; the state taxes therefore did not \u201ccontravene the principle of tribal self-government.\u201d Id. at 158, 100 S.Ct. at 2084.\nMost recently, in Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 137, 102 S.Ct. 894, 901, 71 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982), a tribe\u2019s tax on oil and gas produced on the reservation was upheld:\nThe power to tax is an essential attribute of Indian sovereignty because it is a necessary instrument of self-government and territorial management. This power enables a tribal government to raise revenues for its essential services.... [I]t derives from the tribe\u2019s general authority, as a sovereign, to control economic activity within its jurisdiction, and to defray the cost of providing government services by requiring contributions from persons or enterprises engaged in economic activities within that jurisdiction.\nNone of these precedents directly controls the case at bar. No case has squarely addressed the question whether an Indian tribe may operate and profit from a commercial enterprise prohibited by generally applicable state law. Jicarilla and Colville, however, provide us with a good base from which to reason. Taxation of non-Indians who do business on the reservation, though it goes beyond the direct regulation of relations among Indians or management of tribal resources, is included within a tribe\u2019s inherent powers primarily because it is considered \u201cnecessary\u201d to finance the tribe\u2019s governmental activities and services. The Penobscot Nation, naturally, argues that its beano game functions to fulfill the same goal \u2014 to finance essential tribal services and programs. However, the Nation\u2019s case is weaker than that of the Indians in the tax cases, for at least three reasons. First, the Penobseots\u2019 beano revenues are not \u201cderived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the Tribe [where] the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services.\u201d Colville, 447 U.S. at 156-57, 100 S.Ct. at 2083. The Colville Indians were in a weaker position than the Jicarilla Apaches, in the eyes of the Court, because \u201cthe value marketed by the [Colvilles\u2019] smokeshops to persons coming from outside is not generated on the reservation by activities in which the Tribes have a significant interest,\u201d 447 U.S. at 155, 100 S.Ct. at 2082, whereas the taxpayers in Jicarilla both benefited from tribal services and depleted the natural resources of tribal land. Non-Indian beano players benefit from none of the services that the Penobseots\u2019 beano revenues support. Nor do they, when buying beano tickets, \u201cpurchase\u201d any Indian resource \u2014 such as the right to exploit tribal lands for mineral wealth.\nThe second difference between the present case and the tax cases is related to this economic value discussion. While a tax regulates or adds to the cost of some independent or underlying economic activity, a beano game is its own raison d'etre. Revenue-raising through beano is thus very different from revenue-raising through taxation. Beano is a commercial operation, related to tribal self-government only because of the use to which its profits are put. It shares with taxation none of the regulatory or user charge theories that have historically made taxation an intrinsically governmental function. If the Penobseots\u2019 beano game is within their \u201csovereign\u201d powers, then Indian tribes must have the inherent authority to enter into all spheres of activity from which a profit could be made: everything from selling dry goods to selling drugs could become an aspect of tribal self-government by the tribe\u2019s committing the revenues raised to defraying the expense of the legitimate governmental function of the tribe.\nThe prospect, even though unlikely, of Indian tribes\u2019 claiming the inherent authority to engage in profitable but unlawful activities brings us to the third difference between our case and the tax cases. In Colville and Jicarilla, state laws did not forbid the tribes\u2019 actions. Maine, however, both punishes gambling criminally and forbids the operation of beano games for profit. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the interests of the state must be a part of the calculus where an Indian tribe\u2019s \u201cinherent\u201d rights are under consideration. Colville, 447 U.S. at 156, 100 S.Ct. at 2082-83. Maine has a legitimate governmental interest \u2014 having nothing to do with its own financial needs \u2014 in preventing the Penob-scot Nation\u2019s beano games. The tribe\u2019s interest in beano, by contrast, is purely financial. And in point of fact, the Penobseots would have nothing to \u201csell\u201d if highstakes beano were not prohibited throughout the rest of Maine. The Colville Court allowed the State of Washington to apply its sales and cigarette taxes to on-reservation transactions because the Indian tribes had no inherent right \u201cto market an exemption from state taxation.\u201d 447 U.S. at 155, 100 S.Ct. at 2082. The Penobscot Nation, in our view, has even less right \u201cto market an exemption\u201d from state gambling laws. See Note, In Defense of Tribal Sovereign Immunity, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 1058, 1068 (1982) (\u201cthe Court may be willing to limit the immunity given to tribes when they act commercially\u201d).\nThe Nation argues that the state\u2019s beano law is merely regulatory- \u2014 designed to prevent crooked games \u2014 rather than prohibitory, and that, since there has been no sug-gesti\u00f3n that the Penobscots\u2019 game is dishonest, the state has no interest in preventing it from continuing. History, however, shows that the Nation\u2019s premise is fallacious. Even though gambling may be currently looked upon with growing tolerance, such activity was unlawful under the common law of Maine long before the legislature enacted its anti-gambling statutes, see Lewis v. Littlefield, 15 Me. (3 Shep.) 233, 237 (1829) (\u201cAll wagers in this State [are] unlawful\u201d); and both the common law and statutory prohibitions have grown out of a widely held belief that gambling is an evil from which the people must be protected. See Phalen v. Virginia, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 163, 168, 12 L.Ed. 1030 (1850), quoted in Maine State Raceways v. LaFleur, 147 Me. 367, 372, 87 A.2d 674, 677 (1952) (a lottery \u201cinfests the whole community; it enters every dwelling; it reaches every class; it preys upon the hard earnings of the poor; it plunders the ignorant and simple\u201d). Even if we accepted the Nation\u2019s premise that Maine wishes only to regulate gambling and not to prohibit it, we would reject its conclusion. A motorist may not run a red light simply because no one else is entering the controlled intersection. Just so, an organization running a beano game may not thwart the state\u2019s licensing law just because that organization is not shown to have inflicted upon the public an evil that the law seeks generally to prevent.\nFor these reasons, we believe that the power to tax, recognized in Colville and Jicarilla, is a narrow exception to the general rule limiting an Indian tribe\u2019s inherent authority to regulate \u201cdomestic\u201d matters, and that the Penobscot Nation\u2019s beano game does not fall within that exception. Under federal Indian common law, therefore, we would hold that the State of Maine may enforce 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A against the Penobscot Nation.\nB. Statutory Interpretation\nEver since Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 559, it has been recognized that the powers and authority of an Indian tribe or nation may be either expanded or limited by an act of Congress. See also Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 1677, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978) (tribal sovereignty is \u201csubject to the superior and plenary control of Congress\u201d); Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1086 (tribal sovereignty \u201cexists only at the sufferance of Congress and is subject to complete defeasance\u201d). In the case at bar, the federal government took no steps to alter or affect the status of the Penobscot Nation from the founding of the Republic until 1980. In fact, because of the dearth of federal contract with Maine Indians and their long and intricate historical relationship with the State of Maine, it was long doubted whether they constituted \u201cbona fide tribes\u201d under federal Indian law. See Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, 599 F.2d 1061, 1063-65 (1st Cir.1979); Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 388 F.Supp. 649 (D.Me.), aff\u2019d, 528 F.2d 370 (1st Cir.1975); State v. Dana, 404 A.2d 551 (Me.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1098, 100 S.Ct. 1064, 62 L.Ed.2d 785 (1980). In 1980, Congress acted to settle far-reaching claims of various Maine Indians, including the Penobscots, to substantial money damages and to land comprising approximately two thirds of the state\u2019s territory. The federal settlement act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1721-1735 (Supp. IV 1980), was predicated upon state legislation addressing the same topic, 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6201-6214 (Supp.1982-83), which Congress expressly \u201capproved, ratified, and confirmed.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1721(b)(3), 1725(b)(1). In addition to settling the land dispute, these two acts quite precisely laid out the relationship thenceforth to obtain between the Penob-scot Nation and the State of Maine. It is to these two statutes, therefore, that we turn to determine whether the Nation is now permitted to run an otherwise unlawful beano game on its reservation.\nSection 1725(b)(1) of the federal act states that the Penobscot Nation, its members, and all lands and natural resources owned or held in trust for the Nation or its members, \u201cshall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Maine to the extent and in the manner provided in the Maine Implementing Act.\u201d By the same token, section 1725(f) authorizes the Nation \u201cto exercise jurisdiction, separate and distinct from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of Maine, to the extent authorized by the Maine Implementing Act.\u201d We are thus referred to the state act for an answer to the beano question. Two sections of the state act bear upon our inquiry. 30 M.R. S.A. \u00a7 6204 states:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Act, all Indians, Indian nations, and tribes and bands of Indians in the State and any lands or other natural resources owned by them, held in trust for them by the United States or by any other person or entity shall be subject to the laws of the State and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other person or lands or other natural resources therein.\nMore specifically, section 6206(1) confers upon the Nation the status of a Maine municipality, with an exception for \u201cinternal tribal matters\u201d:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Act, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, within their respective Indian territories, shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, privileges, powers and immunities, including, but without limitation, the power to enact ordinances and collect taxes, and shall be subject to all the duties, obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality of and subject to the laws of the State, provided, however, that internal tribal matters, in-eluding membership in the respective tribe or nation, the right to reside within the respective Indian territories, tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\n(Emphasis added).\nPut as narrowly as possible, then, the issue here boils down to whether the Penob-scot Nation\u2019s beano game is an \u201cinternal tribal matter.\u201d In answering this question, in the negative, we first dispose of the contention that any matter over which an Indian tribe would have inherent authority under federal common law is an \u201cinternal tribal matter\u201d under section 6206(1).\nFor one thing, section 1725(h) of the federal act makes \u201cthe laws and regulations of the United States which are generally applicable to Indians\u201d inapplicable to the Nation insofar as any of such federal laws or regulations \u201caffects or preempts the civil, criminal, or regulatory jurisdiction of the State of Maine.\u201d We read the term \u201claws\u201d to include case law. Cf. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722(d) (\u201claws of the State\u201d includes Maine common law). It would make no sense, in an integrated legislative package, to define the state\u2019s jurisdiction with reference to federal ease law, while at the same time declaring that the self-same case law has no impact upon the jurisdiction of the state of Maine.\nFor another thing, the legislative history of both acts makes it clear that they were intended to change the relationship between tribal and state authority from what it had been up until 1980. Counsel for the Nation said as much in public hearings before a state legislative committee:\nIn the end what we wound up with was a blueprint for a governmental relationship between Indians and non-Indians alike\u2014 unlike that which exists anywhere else in the United States.\nTranscript of March 28, 1980 Public Hearing before the Joint Select Committee on Indian Land Claims, 25 (1980). While there was some disagreement as to whether the acts would limit or expand tribal powers, compare H.Rep. No. 96-1353, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1980) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News, p. 3786 (\u201cthe settlement strengthens the sovereignty of the Maine tribes\u201d), with Legis.Rec. 721 (1980) (statement of Sen. Conley: \u201cIf this legislation passes, it becomes unique in ... that this will be the only State in the Union that does not have a nation within a nation, that all Indians are subjected to Maine law\u201d), this disagreement stemmed primarily from the fact that the various legislators held differing views as to the extent of the tribes\u2019 powers before the settlement. It was generally agreed that the acts set up a relationship between the tribes, the state, and the federal government different from the relationship of Indians in other states to the state and federal governments.\nFinally, we note that the phrase \u201cinternal tribal matters\u201d is not a legal term of art. One would be rash to equate this phrase with such terms as \u201cinternal and social relations,\u201d United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. at 381, 6 S.Ct. at 1109, \u201cinternal affairs,\u201d Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. at 221, 79 S.Ct. at 271, or \u201ctribal self-government,\u201d McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission, 411 U.S. at 179, 93 S.Ct. at 1266, merely because of a partial language overlap.\nWe, therefore, look not to federal common law to define \u201cinternal tribal matters,\u201d but to the statute itself and to its legislative history. The state act follows the term \u201cinternal tribal matters\u201d with a list of those matters included in the term: \u201cmembership in the respective tribe or nation, the right to reside within the respective Indian territories, tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income.\u201d 30 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 6206(1). Although this list is not exclusive, it cannot be denied that all of the items in it are fundamentally unlike the operation of an otherwise unlawful beano game. By the very nature of the matters listed, action by the Nation directly affecting them would not tend to bring the Nation into conflict with state laws of general application. By the familiar ejusdem generis rule, a general term followed by a list of illustrations is ordinarily assumed to embrace only concepts similar to those illustrations. Brunswick School Board v. Califano, 449 F.Supp. 866, 870 (D.Me.1978), aff\u2019d sub nom., Isleboro School Committee v. Califano, 593 F.2d 424 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 972, 100 S.Ct. 467, 62 L.Ed.2d 387 (1979). See also Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 588, 100 S.Ct. 1889, 1895, 64 L.Ed.2d 525 (1980). We construe section 6206(1) in accordance with this principle and find that beano is not embraced within the general term. The Nation argues that its beano games are related to \u201ctribal government\u201d because their proceeds help finance that government and its activities. We must reject this argument. As the Superior Court wrote, the exception so interpreted \u201cwould virtually nullify state jurisdiction,\u201d although section 6204 makes state jurisdiction the rule for the Penobscot Nation. If beano is an \u201cinternal tribal matter\u201d and exempt from state regulation because of the uses to which its income is put, the same logic would make a myriad of other forbidden and even criminal practices legal so long as they turned a profit for the Nation. This result would violate the overall spirit of the settlement acts as well as common sense.\nWe note also that section 6206(1) of the Maine act explicitly authorizes the Nation to collect taxes. This grant would be unnecessary if, as the Nation argues, governmental financing mechanisms automatically fall within the Nation\u2019s scope of authority under the \u201cinternal tribal affairs\u201d rubric.\nFinally, the acts\u2019 legislative history supports our ejusdem generis construction of the term \u201cinternal tribal matters\u201d \u2014 that is, our conclusion that the term embraces only those matters illustratively listed in the statute and other matters like them.\nAt the time the settlement acts were under consideration, the Attorney General of the State of Maine understood the \u201cinternal tribal affairs\u201d exception to have been drafted \u201cin recognition of [the Indians\u2019] unique cultural or historical interest.\u201d S.Rep. No. 96-957, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1980). The House Report stated that the settlement acts would protect the Indians against \u201cacculturation\u201d \u201cby providing for tribal governments ... which control all such internal matters.\u201d H.Rep. No. 96-1353, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 17 (1980), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 3793. Counsel to the Penobscot Nation told a Maine legislative committee that he understood the settlement acts to accommodate \u201cthe Tribe\u2019s legitimate interest in managing their internal affairs, in exercising tribal powers in certain areas of particular cultural importance .... \u201d Transcript of March 28, 1980 Public Hearing before the Joint Select Committee on Indian Land Claims, 25 (1980). And the committee itself reported that the exception to full state jurisdiction over Indians was provided \u201cin recognition of traditional Indian practices.\u201d Report of the Joint Select Committee on Indian Land Claims 1 (1980). See also Transcript of March 28, 1980 Public Hearing before the Joint Select Committee on Indian Land Claims, 7 (statement of Sen. Collins: \u201cthere are some exceptions [to full state jurisdiction] which recognize historical Indian concerns\u201d).\nBeano has played no part in the Penob-scot Nation\u2019s historical culture or development. It is not uniquely Indian in character. It is not a traditional Indian practice and has no particular cultural importance for the Nation. Its only relationship to the Nation\u2019s \u201cinternal tribal matters\u201d consists in the fact that the games\u2019 proceeds are used to finance admittedly legitimate tribal services and programs. This link is not strong enough to shield the games from the enforcement of 17 M.R.S.A. ch. 13-A on the Penobscot reservation.\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.\n. Since by 17 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 325 only a fine may be imposed for an infraction of section 312, that offense is classified as a \u201ccivil violation.\u201d See 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4-A(4) (1983). The Maine Criminal Code, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 953, 954, also imposes criminal penalties upon any \u201cperson\u201d who advances or profits from unlawful gambling, defined as gambling (which includes beano) that is \u201cnot expressly authorized by statute.\u201d For the present decision, we need not address the question whether the Penob-scot Nation is a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of the criminal statute. See discussion at p. 482 below.\nThe seriousness with which the criminal law views any gambling not expressly authorized by statute is demonstrated by the severity of sentence to be imposed upon aggravated unlawful gambling (gambling not expressly authorized by statute from which the promoter gets more than $250 in any 24-hour period, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 953). That offense is classified as a Class B crime, punishable by imprisonment up to ten years and a fine for a natural person of up to $10,000 and for an organization of up to $20,000. 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(2)(B), 1301(1)(A), 1301(3)(B).\n. The holding of White Mountain was based upon the Court\u2019s conclusion that the federal government had preempted the field of timber regulation on the Apache reservation so as to \u201cpreclude the additional burden\u201d of state taxes, 448 U.S. at 150, 100 S.Ct. at 2587, and did not depend on any determination that the tribe\u2019s \u201cinherent\u201d or \u201csovereign\u201d powers prohibited the state taxation. See note 4 below for a fuller discussion of this distinction.\n. See, e.g., Barona Group of Captain Grande Band of Mission Indians v. Duffy, 694 F.2d 1185 (9th Cir.1982), petition for cert. filed, - U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2091, 77 L.Ed.2d 301 (1983); Oneida Tribe of Indians v. State of Wisconsin, 518 F.Supp. 712 (W.D.Wis.1981); Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Butterworth, 491 F.Supp. 1015 (S.D.Fla.1980), aff\u2019d, 658 F.2d 310 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1020, 102 S.Ct. 1717, 72 L.Ed.2d 138 (1982).\n. In White Mountain, 448 U.S. at 142-43, 100 S.Ct. at 2583, the Court explained that there are two doctrines that may render state law inapplicable to reservation Indians. The state may not act if the field it wishes to regulate has been \u201cpreempted,\u201d as to an Indian tribe, by federal treaties, statutes, or regulations, or if the state action would infringe upon the Indians\u2019 inherent rights of limited self-government. \u201cThe two barriers are independent.\u201d See, also McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 172, 93 S.Ct. at 1262 (\u201cthe trend has been away from the idea of inherent sovereignty as a bar to state jurisdiction and towards reliance on federal pre-emption\u201d); Note, Indian Law \u2014 State Jurisdiction on Indian Reservations, 3 W. New Eng.L.Rev. 715, 719-23 (1981). Thus, in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976), Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Commission, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965), White Mountain, and McClanahan, state taxes were held inapplicable to various reservation Indians or activities because they were preempted by, or were inconsistent with, federal laws governing Indian economic activity.\n. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1721(a)(9) (finding of Congress that from 1820 until the passage of the federal act it was the State of Maine rather than the United States that provided services to, asserted jurisdiction over, and assumed responsibility for the Penobscot Nation).\n. In the settlement, the Penobscot Nation became the beneficiary of two federal trust funds: (1) the Penobscot Land Acquisition Fund ($26,-800,000) for buying land for the Nation; and (2) the Penobscots\u2019 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Fund ($13,500,000), from which the income is paid quarterly to the Nation. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1724(a)-(d).\n. The Penobscot Nation\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the expansion of the State\u2019s jurisdiction over the Maine Indian tribes from what he conceived it previously to be was part of the quid pro quo for the State\u2019s going along with the settlement, which was necessary for the Nation to get the monetary benefits provided it by the settlement. He said:\nIn light of all this, one might ask why the Indians were willing to even discuss the question of jurisdiction with the State but simply the answer is that they were obliged to do so if they wanted to effectuate the Settlement of the monetary and land aspects of the claim.... [T]he Tribes opened negoti-atlon with the State concerning the question of jurisdiction not because they wanted to do so but because they were obliged to do so to obtain a settlement that they had already negotiated with the federal government.\nTranscript of March 28, 1980 Public Hearing before the Joint Select Committee on Indian Land Claims, 23-24 (1980).",
