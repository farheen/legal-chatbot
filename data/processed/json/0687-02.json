Upon review of the record however, we find that no evidentiary hearing on the petition for mandamus was conducted below and therefore, we are unable to review the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s ruling.\nAccordingly, the defendant\u2019s appeal is hereby sustained, the order granting the petition for writ of mandamus is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court in order that an evidentiary hearing may be conducted on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\nMURRAY, J., did not participate.",
