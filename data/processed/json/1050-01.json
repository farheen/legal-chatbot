        "text": "OPINION BY\nJudge COHN JUBELIRER.\nSkyHawke Technologies LLC, (Sky-Hawke) petitions for review of the Order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board), which affirmed the Unemployment Compensation Referee\u2019s (Referee) determination that Ross A. Gershel (Claimant) was not ineligible for unemployment compensation (UC) benefits under Sections 402(h) and 4(l)(2)(B) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law). SkyHawke argues that the Board erred as a matter of law in finding Claimant eligible for UC benefits because Claimant was not an employee, but a self-employed, independent contractor and, therefore, ineligible for UC benefits. For the following reasons, we reverse the Order of the Board.\nClaimant was employed by SkyHawke to perform global positioning satellite (GPS) mapping of golf courses from June 2009 until December 2, 2009. Claimant applied for UC benefits effective December 27, 2009, asserting a lack of work and naming GBI, Inc. (GBI), his former employer, as his employer. (Initial Internet Claim at 1-2, December 30, 2009, R.R. at la-2a; Referee\u2019s Determination, Findings of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 1.) The Harrisburg UC Service Center (Service Center) found Claimant eligible for benefits, but concluded that SkyHawke, not GBI, was Claimant\u2019s employer. (Notice of Determination at 1, R.R. at 12a.) SkyHawke appealed and the matter was assigned to the Referee, who held a hearing at which Claimant and Sky-Hawke presented evidence. Claimant testified on his own behalf and SkyHawke offered the testimony of Chris Moulds, its manager of the quality control and course mapping department.\nClaimant initially indicated that, when he filed for UC benefits, he thought he was filing a claim against GBI, not SkyHawke, and that he believed SkyHawke was appealing the Service Center\u2019s determination that it was the responsible employer. However, the Referee explained that the issue of which employer was financially liable was not before him because Claimant\u2019s claim was based on the first four of the last five completed quarters and that was an issue different than the one before him, whether Claimant was eligible for UC benefits. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 25, R.R. at 45a.) Claimant testified that SkyHawke paid him a flat rate based on whether he mapped a nine-hole or eighteen-hole golf course. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 24, R.R. at 44a; SkyHawke\u2019s Exh. 9-9c, R.R. at 67a-71a.) Claimant acknowledged that his work was not supervised in any way, he had no reporting times or deadlines, and he understood that he was an independent contractor and not an employee of SkyHawke. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 25, 27, R.R. at 45a, 47a.) Indeed, Claimant agreed that SkyHawke \u201cwould not exercise control over [Claimant\u2019s] activities or business operation.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 27, R.R. at 47a.)\nMr. Moulds testified that SkyHawke paid Claimant $250 to map an eighteen-hole golf course and $125 for a nine-hole golf course, but did not pay any employee benefits or make tax payments on Claimant\u2019s behalf. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 14, 16, R.R. at 34a, 36a; FOF \u00b6 11.) He stated that Sky-Hawke did not control Claimant\u2019s day-today activities or supervise Claimant while he mapped golf courses, and SkyHawke communicated with Claimant approximately twice per month. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 13, R.R. at 33a.) Mr. Moulds indicated that Claimant was free to accept or reject any assignment. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 12, R.R. at 32a; FOF \u00b6 12.) According to Mr. Moulds, Sky-Hawke provided Claimant with proprietary software and equipment, which was licensed to SkyHawke, to map the golf courses and a brief training session in Pennsylvania with another SkyHawke mapper on how to use the equipment. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 20-22, R.R. at 40a-42a; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.) With regard to the cessation of Claimant\u2019s work in December 2009, Mr. Moulds testified that it was impractical to map golf courses during the winter months because GPS targets are not visible when there is snow on the ground, and many golf courses close and will not allow people on the golf course. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 12, R.R. at 32a.) Finally, Mr. Moulds indicated that, if Claimant\u2019s mapping did not meet SkyHawke\u2019s quality standards, Claimant was required to re-map the golf course in order to be paid for that particular course. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 16-17, R.R. at 36a-37a; FOF \u00b610.)\nIn addition to Mr. Moulds\u2019 testimony, SkyHawke offered the \u201cSkycourse Enablement Agreement\u201d (Agreement), signed by Claimant, in which SkyHawke agreed not to exercise control over Claimant\u2019s activities, acknowledged that Claimant was an independent contractor, and confirmed that Claimant would receive Form 1099s. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 4-5, SkyHawke Exh. 3 (Agreement) \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, R.R at 24a-25a, 57a; FOF \u00b6 5.) The Agreement indicated that SkyHawke would not provide Claimant with health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, paid vacation, office space, or secretarial support. (Agreement \u00b6 6, R.R. at 57a.) The Agreement did include a non-compete agreement whereby, in the event of his separation from employment, Claimant agreed not to engage or compete in \u201cany business relating to the GPS En-ablement of golf courses, golf course GPS equipment, or offer[] products and services similar to [SkyHawke\u2019s] products\u201d for one year after termination of the Agreement. (Agreement \u00b6 10, R.R. at 58a; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) The Agreement also contained a trade secret and confidentiality agreement regarding SkyHawke\u2019s proprietary software. (Agreement at Exhibit A, R.R. at 61a-62a; FOF \u00b67.) Additionally, the Agreement included a Third Party Services provision through which Sky-Hawke retained the right to modify or terminate the Agreement if SkyHawke determined, in its sole discretion, that Claimant\u2019s provision of services to other parties in the golf industry was not in SkyHawke\u2019s best interests or would pose an actual or potential conflict with SkyHawke\u2019s interests. (Agreement \u00b6 IB, R.R. at 59a.) Claimant indicated at the hearing that he understood this particular clause to mean that he could not perform work for any other golf GPS companies. (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 24, R.R. at 44a.)\nBased upon this evidence, the Referee concluded that Claimant was SkyHawke\u2019s employee because SkyHawke: \u201cdetermined the amount of remuneration to be paid\u201d; \u201cprovided the required equipment ... to perform the duties\u201d; trained Claimant on how to use SkyHawke\u2019s equipment; required Claimant to re-do his work if SkyHawke found it lacking; and made Claimant sign confidentiality and non-compete agreements, thereby precluding Claimant from performing this type of work for competing companies. (Referee Decision at 2.) The Referee further noted that Claimant had no proprietary interest in SkyHawke. (FOF \u00b6 3.) SkyHawke appealed to the Board, which affirmed the Referee\u2019s decision and adopted the Referee\u2019s findings and conclusions as its own. SkyHawke now petitions this Court for review.\nOn appeal, SkyHawke argues that the Board erred when it determined that Claimant was an employee, not an independent contractor, and, therefore, was eligible for UC benefits pursuant to Section 402(h) of the Law. SkyHawke contends that it overcame the presumption that Claimant was its employee by establishing, as required by Section 4(i )(2)(B) of the Law, that Claimant: (1) was free from SkyHawke\u2019s control or direction; and (2) was involved in an independently established business. 43 P.S. \u00a7 753(Z )(2)(B).\nSection 402(h) of the Law states that \u201c[a]n employe shall be ineligible for compensation for any week ... [i]n which he is engaged in self-employment.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(h). Generally, there is a presumption in the Law that an individual receiving wages is an employee and not an independent contractor engaged in self-employment. Electrolux Corporation v. Department of Labor and Industry, Bureau of Employer Tax Operations, 705 A.2d 1357, 1359-60 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998). However, an employer can overcome this presumption by establishing that a claimant is self-employed. Id. at 1360. Although the Law does not define \u201cself-employment,\u201d our courts utilize Section 4(Z )(2)(B) of the Law \u201cto fill the void because its obvious purpose is to exclude independent contractors from coverage.\u201d Beacon Flag Car Company, Inc. (Doris Weyant) v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 910 A.2d 103, 107 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006). Section 4(l)(2)(B) provides, in relevant part:\nServices performed by an individual for wages shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that \u2014 (a) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services both under his contract of service and in fact; and (b) as to such services such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 753(l )(2)(B) (emphasis added). Thus, pursuant to this section, an employer establishes that a claimant is self-employed by proving that the claimant was: (1) free from control and direction in the performance of his service; and (2) customarily engaged in an independent trade or business as to that service. Beacon Flag, 910 A.2d at 107. Whether Claimant was an employee or an independent contractor under the Law is a question of law subject to our review. Sharp Equipment Company v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 808 A.2d 1019, 1023 n. 6 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). Consequently, we must determine whether the Board committed an error of law when it concluded that Claimant was an employee and not an independent contractor.\nThe first prong, i.e., whether the claimant was free from control and direction in the performance of his work, \u201cis based upon a showing of control \u2018not only with regard to the work to be done but also with regard to the manner of performing it.\u2019 \u201d Erie Independence House, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 126 Pa.Cmwlth. 358, 559 A.2d 994, 995 (1989) (quoting Pavalonis v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 57 Pa.Cmwlth. 289, 426 A.2d 215, 217 (1981)). \u201cNo one factor controls the outcome.\u201d Sharp Equipment, 808 A.2d at 1024. \u201cRather, the unique facts of each case must be examined in order to resolve the question of employee versus independent contractor status.\u201d Danielle Viktor, Ltd. v. Department of Labor and Industry, Bureau of Employer Tax Operations, 586 Pa. 196, 229, 892 A.2d 781, 801 (2006). In other words, \u201cthe courts look to the entire relationship to determine whether the requisite control exists to establish an employer-employee relationship.\u201d Tracy v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 23 A.3d 612, 616 (Pa.Cmwlth.2011).\nIn analyzing the issue of control, courts consider factors such as: whether there was a fixed rate of remuneration; whether taxes were withheld from the claimant\u2019s pay; whether the employer supplied the tools necessary to carry out the services; whether the employer provided on-the-job training; whether the employer set the time and location for work; whether the employer had the right to monitor the claimant\u2019s work and review performance; and whether the employer held regular meetings that the claimant was expected to attend.\nResource Staffing, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 995 A.2d 887, 890 n. 6 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010). Additionally, the level of direct, day-to-day supervision may also be considered in determining whether a claimant is an independent contractor. See, e.g., Venango Newspapers v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 158 Pa.Cmwlth. 379, 631 A.2d 1384, 1388 (1993) (considering direct daily supervision as a factor in whether the claimant was an independent contractor).\nIn concluding that Claimant was Sky-Hawke\u2019s employee, the Board relied on the facts that: Claimant used SkyHawke\u2019s licensed, proprietary equipment to perform his mapping, which SkyHawke trained Claimant to use; SkyHawke made Claimant re-do any mapping that was not satisfactory; and Claimant signed the Agreement, precluding him from performing similar work for SkyHawke\u2019s competitors. SkyHawke argues that these factors are not dispositive pursuant to, inter alia, Viktor and Beacon Flag and that the Board erred in relying on those factors to hold that Claimant was not an independent contractor.\nIn Viktor, our Supreme Court affirmed this Court\u2019s order reversing the Department of Labor and Industry\u2019s (Department) decision and concluding that the limousine drivers in Viktor were independent contractors and not employees as held by the Department. In concluding that the limousine companies did not have control or the right to control the drivers, this Court considered the following factors: the drivers were free to accept or reject assignments and determine their own schedules; were hired on a job-to-job basis; were free of direction or control in performing their work; and were free to perform their services for other companies. Viktor, 586 Pa. at 215, 892 A.2d at 792-93. Although the issue of \u201ccontrol\u201d was not a contested issue on appeal, the Supreme Court rejected the Department\u2019s argument that the drivers were not independent contractors because they did not own their limousines and, therefore, had no proprietary interest in their businesses. Id. at 216, 892 A.2d at 793. Troubled by the drivers\u2019 emphasis on the proprietary interest issue, the Supreme Court noted that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion in Vikto did not contribute to that confusion, but \u201cproperly articulated that \u2018to the extent that some prior cases have considered a proprietary risk of financial loss as suggestive of independent contractor status, this is not a necessary element of the long-established standard.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 215 n. 11, 892 A.2d at 793 n. 11. The Supreme Court further stated that this Court \u201cused the proper analysis and made the appropriate conclusion\u201d that \u201cownership of all assets necessary to perform the service ... is not a necessary part of the standard established by this court.\u201d Id. at 217, 892 A.2d at 794.\nIn Beacon Flag, a case involving whether a \u201cflag car driver\u201d who provided escort services to customers with oversized loads was an independent contractor, this Court was asked to consider the effect a non-compete clause between the employer and claimant would have on the independent contractor-employee analysis. After considering the totality of the circumstances, this Court concluded that the claimant was an independent contractor and not an employee. Beacon Flag, 910 A.2d at 109. In analyzing the first prong of Section 4(l )(2)(B), this Court noted that some drivers had their own vehicles and others leased vehicles from a leasing company; the drivers received a certain price per mile from the dispatch service, depending upon the client and type of load; the dispatch service provided an invoice, collected the fee, and paid the drivers; the drivers did not report to an office and had no meetings to attend; and the drivers were provided with 1099 tax forms, indicating that the dispatch service was not withholding taxes from the drivers\u2019 payments. Beacon Flag, 910 A.2d at 108. Additionally, this Court pointed out that the drivers, including the claimant: controlled the time, place, and routes; were not supervised in their daily work; and, most importantly, were free to accept or reject any assignment without repercussions. Id. With regard to the non-compete clause, we held that the non-compete \u201cclause did not outweigh the numerous other factors that weighed in favor of finding an absence of control.\u201d Id. Indeed this Court noted:\n[bjecause non-compete agreements are disfavored in Pennsylvania, and generally are unenforceable, see Zimmerman v. Unemployment Compensation Board, of Review, 836 A.2d 1074 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003), we are particularly loathe to hold that the mere existence of such an agreement places the parties involved in an employer-employee relationship as a matter of law.\nId. at 109 n. 11.\nHere, like the limousine drivers in Viktor, Claimant lacks ownership or a proprietary interest in SkyHawke\u2019s licensed equipment, which he uses to perform the GPS mapping of golf courses. However, pursuant to Viktor, and contrary to the Board\u2019s determination, this lack of proprietary interest does not, alone, compel the conclusion that Claimant was SkyHawke\u2019s employee. Moreover, as this Court held in Beacon Flag, a non-compete agreement is not dispositive, but is just one factor to be weighed in the totality of the circumstances.\nAfter reviewing the totality of the circumstances here, we conclude, as the Supreme Court did in Viktor and this Court did in Beacon Flag, that Claimant was free from direction and control in the performance of his services for SkyHawke. These circumstances include: the fact that Claimant was not required to work specific hours or attend regular meetings, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 10, R.R. at 30a); the lack of any day-to-day accountability to and supervision by SkyHawke, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 12-13, 19, R.R. at 32a-33a, 39a); the lack of control over which courses were to be mapped, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 11, R.R. at 31a); Claimant\u2019s ability to reject any assignment, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 12, R.R. at 32a); the lack of tax withholding and employee benefits, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 19, R.R. at 39a; Agreement \u00b6 6, R.R. at 57a); the infrequent communication with SkyHawke (about two times per month and no contact during the winter months), (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 13, R.R. at 33a); the lack of supervision or control during the time when Claimant was actually performing the golf course mapping, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 11-13, R.R. at 31a-33a); the fact that Claimant was paid a set rate for his work, regardless of the amount of time he spent mapping a particular golf course, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 16-17, R.R. at 36a-37a); the lack of any deadlines, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 25, R.R. at 45a); and Claimant\u2019s testimony that he thought he had an independent contractor relationship with SkyHawke, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 27, R.R. at 47a). That Claimant did not own the specialized GPS equipment required to perform the work, (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 23-24, R.R. at 43a-44a), is not fatal to the \u201ccontrol prong\u201d and is not a necessary part of the standard established by this Court. Viktor, 586 Pa. at 217, 892 A.2d at 794. Moreover, SkyHawke\u2019s non-compete \u201cclause [does] not outweigh the numerous other factors that weight ] in favor of finding an absence of control.\u201d Beacon Flag, 910 A.2d at 108. Finally, with regard to the Board\u2019s reliance on the fact that Sky-Hawke could require Claimant to re-map a particular golf course if his first efforts were not satisfactory, this Court, in C E Credits OnLine v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 946 A.2d 1162 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008), stated that \u201c\u2018[c]ontrol\u2019 for purposes of Section 4(Z )(2)(B) of the Law is not a matter of approving or directing the final work product so much as it is a matter of controlling the means of its accomplishment,\u201d because \u201cevery job, whether performed by an employee or by an independent contractor, has parameters and expectations.\u201d Id. at 1169. Thus, we conclude that this factor does not transform SkyHawke into Claimant\u2019s employer because work performed as an independent contractor must be acceptable to whoever has requested the services or products. Id. In consideration of these circumstances, we cannot agree with the Board that SkyHawke exercised control and direction over Claimant, but conclude that SkyHawke sustained its burden under the first prong of Section 4(I )(2)(B).\nWe now turn to the second prong, whether \u201cas to such services such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 753(I )(2)(B). We first set forth the contract provisions at the heart of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding this prong.\n13. SERVICES TO THIRD PARTIES. The Company recognizes that the Contractor may have agreements with other third parties in the Golf Industry to provide Services. As a condition to the approval of this agreement by the Company, the Contractor must completely disclose on Exhibit C of this Agreement any agreements to provide Services for other third parties in the Golf industry, whether oral or written. The Company reserves the right to review and approve the compatibility of the Contractor performing the Services for the Company in conjunction with Services for other third parties in the Golf Industry. The Company also reserves the right to modify or terminate this Agreement if, in it\u2019s sole discretion, the best interests of the Company are not met by the Contractor providing Services to specific third parties, or if, in its [sic] sole discretion, the presence of the other third party agreement(s) poses an actual or potential conflict of the best interests of the Company.\n(Agreement \u00b6 13, R.R. at 59a.) Additionally, the non-compete clause, found in paragraph ten of the Agreement, purports to preclude Claimant from, for a period of one year following separation from Sky-Hawke,\ndirectly or indirectly engage[ing] or competing] in any business relating to the GPS Enablement of golf courses, golf course GPS equipment, or offering products and services similar to the Company\u2019s Products in the United States or relevant Country in which the Contractor Services are performed. Directly or indirectly engaging in any competitive business includes, but is not limited to, (i) engaging in a business as owner, partner or agent, or (ii) becoming an employee of any third party that is engaged in such business, or (iii) having a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in any such business, or (iv) soliciting any customer of the Company for the benefit of a third party that is engaged in such business. The Contractor agrees that this non-compete provision will not adversely affect the livelihood of Contractor.\n(Agreement \u00b6 10, R.R. at 58a.) The Board argues that, due to these provisions in the Agreement, Claimant could not be engaged in an independent trade or business because he was not free to perform services as a GPS mapper to anyone who wished to avail themselves of those services. (Board\u2019s Br. at 9-10.) SkyHawke responds that \u201cClaimant was free to provide GPS mapping services to the public[,] and was merely restricted from providing GPS mapping services of golf course[s]\u201d to other golf companies, companies competing with SkyHawke, or those providing services similar to SkyHawke\u2019s end product. (SkyHawke\u2019s Br. at 21; Hr\u2019g Tr. at 15, R.R. at 35a.) In examining these competing arguments, we must consider whether: (1) \u201cthe individual was capable of performing the activities in question to anyone who wished to avail themselves of the services\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe nature of the business compelled the individual to look to only a single employer for the continuation of such services.\u201d Venango Newspapers, 631 A.2d at 1388.\nA similar situation was presented in Beacon Flag, where we considered whether the non-compete clause prevented Beacon Flag from establishing that the claimant conducted herself as an \u201cindependently established\u201d business. In concluding that it did not, we explained that the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe ability to work for more than one enterprise [was] an important factor in determining independent contractor status pursuant to [S]ection 4(\u00a3)(2)(B),\u201d but it \u201cwas not the only factor.\u201d Beacon Flag, 910 A.2d at 109. Once again, citing Viktor, we emphasized that \u201cthe unique facts of each case must be examined in order to resolve the question of\u2019 a claimant\u2019s status as an employee or independent contractor. Id. Using this approach, we concluded that the claimant was an independent contractor, particularly where she could accept or reject any assignment, there was no accountability to Beacon Flag because she was not required to report anywhere, she was in control of the routes selected, and she determined how and when she performed her services. Id. at 108. We noted that:\n[i]t is difficult to fathom a situation where someone other than an individual engaged in his or her own business would possess the unmitigated prerogative to accept or reject assignments at will, to work only when he or she chose to ... and to perform the services however he or she saw fit to do so.\nId. (emphasis and omission in original) (quoting Viktor, 586 Pa. at 222, 892 A.2d at 797). Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthe non-compete clause [was] not dispositive\u201d and Beacon Flag \u201csustained its burden under the second prong.\u201d Id.\nIn the instant case, as in Beacon Flag, the Board found that Claimant \u201cwas allowed to refuse or accept an assignment.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 12.) Moreover, although the relevant provisions of the Agreement limited Claimant\u2019s ability to work for other entities, those limitations were related to the particular area of services, i.e., GPS mapping of golf courses. Claimant was still able to perform GPS mapping services for the public or companies, so long as that work did not relate to golf course mapping. Additionally, the Third Party Services part of the Agreement clearly recognized that Claimant could perform work elsewhere in the golf industry, but provided SkyHawke the ability to review that work to determine whether it conflicted with the services Claimant provided for SkyHawke. Finally, the fact that Claimant remains able to perform GPS mapping services for those other than SkyHawke\u2019s competitors and perform other services in the golf industry that do not infringe upon Sky-Hawke\u2019s business supports the conclusion that the nature of Claimant\u2019s business does not require him to look only to one employer to provide his services. Therefore, based on our consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the circumstances here support the conclusion that Claimant was engaged in an independent trade or business and outweigh the contrary evidence, such as the non-compete clause and Third Party Services Agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that SkyHawke satisfied the second prong of Section 4(l )(2)(B) and, in doing so, has established that Claimant was self-employed, rebutting the presumption that Claimant was its employee for the purposes of UC benefits.\nBecause we hold that Claimant was a self-employed, independent contractor, we reverse the Order of the Board.\nORDER\nNOW, August 31, 2011, the Order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review in the above-captioned matter is hereby REVERSED.\n. Act of December 5, 1936, Second Ex.Sess., P.L. (1937) 2897, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 802(h), 753(Z )(2)(B). Section 402(h) of the Law provides that an employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week \"[i]n which he is engaged in self-employment.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(h). Section 4(Z)(2)(B) sets forth two considerations for determining whether a claimant is considered \"self-employed\" for the purposes of the Law. 43 P.S. \u00a7 753(7 J(2)(B); Beacon Flag Car Company, Inc. (Doris Weyant) v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 910 A.2d 103, 107 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006).\n. SkyHawke is headquartered in Mississippi.\n. \"The Court\u2019s review is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether an error of law was committed, whether a practice or procedure of the Board was not followed or whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d Western & Southern Life Insurance Co. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 913 A.2d 331, 334 n. 2 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006).\n.
