      {
        "text": "OPINION AND ORDER\nLAMB, Vice Chancellor.\nI.\nThis action arises out of two loans advanced to the defendant, a Delaware bmit-ed partnership engaged in the business of commercial real estate development, by the plaintiff, a Delaware bmited liability company also engaged in the business of commercial real estate development. The loans were secured by units in a bmited partnership. The borrower eventuaby defaulted on the loans, and the lender sought to dispose of the units in an open outcry auction. After a significant marketing process by the lender\u2019s financial advisor, the lender made the only bid at the auction and purchased the units.\nThe lender brought this action and now moves for summary judgment seeking a judicial determination that it is entitled to enforcement of its loans. The lender also seeks a declaration that its foreclosure auction was conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, and that it was the winner of the auction. The borrower opposes the summary judgment motion and also has counterclaimed on a variety of theories, including breach of contract, fraud, tortious interference, and breach of fiduciary duties.\nThe motion for summary judgment must be granted. There are no genuine issues of material fact related to the lender\u2019s right to enforce the provisions of its loan. There are also no genuine issues of fact related to the commercial reasonableness of the foreclosure auction of the units or the fact that the lender was the winning bidder of the auction.\nThe counterclaims must also be dismissed. A declaration that the lender is entitled to enforce its loans and that it is the winner of a reasonably conducted auction precludes many of the counterclaims. The tortious interference claims must be dismissed because the borrower waived enforcement of certain contracts at issue and because the borrower has failed to show that any business relations with a third party actually existed. Further, the fraud-based claims have either been waived or are precluded by an integration clause in the loan agreement. Finally, the fiduciary duty claim must be dismissed because the borrower was not owed a fiduciary duty by the lender.\nII.\nA. The Units\nPrimestone Investment Partners L.P. (\u201cPrimestone\u201d) is indebted to Vornado PS, L.L.C. for two loans: (1) a $62,000,000 loan made by Vornado on September 26, 2000 (the \u201cVornado Loan\u201d) and (2) a $40,000,000 loan originally made by Prudential Securities Corporation in 1997 (the \u201cPrudential Loan\u201d). To secure this debt, Primestone pledged 7,944,893 limited partnership units (the \u201cUnits\u201d) of Prime Group Realty, L.P. (\u201cPGRLP\u201d). Both loans are guaranteed by five affiliates of Primestone (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d). Primestone and each of the Guarantors (together, the \u201cPrivate Prime Parties\u201d) are under common control.\nSubject to certain conditions, the Units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of Prime Group Realty Trust (\u201cPGE\u201d), a company publicly traded on the NYSE. If a holder of the Units seeks to exchange them for PGE shares, however, PGE has the option of paying the holder cash rather than delivering the shares. PGE\u2019s main asset is partnership units in PGRLP. For each partnership unit owned by PGE, there is one common share of PGE outstanding. The Units themselves do not entitle the holder to any voting rights in relation to PGE, and only limited voting rights with respect to PGRLP. The exchangeability of the Units into PGE shares is further limited by PGE\u2019s Declaration of Trust, which prohibits any one investor from holding more than 9.9% of PGE stock without the consent of PGE\u2019s Board of Trustees (the \u201cPGE Board\u201d). If such consent were given and all of the Units were converted, the Units would amount to 30.1% of PGE\u2019s common stock.\nB. The Loans\nOn September 26, 2000, the $62,000,000 Vornado Loan was advanced pursuant to a Loan Agreement between Primestone, the Guarantors, Michael Reschke, Chairman of PGE\u2019s Board, and Vornado. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Vornado Loan Agreement, the Vornado Loan matured on October 25, 2001, at the latest. The Vornado Loan also contained a \u201cno shop\u201d provision that prohibited Primestone, during the term of the Loan and for thirty days thereafter, from discussing or soliciting a refinancing without the written consent of Vornado. Further, the Loan contained a \u201cright of first offer\u201d provision, which provided that if Primestone sought to arrange for refinancing of the Loan with a third party, Vornado had the first right to match the proposed refinancing arrangement and thereby supersede the new lender. The Vornado Loan was made, in part, due to ongoing negotiations between Primestone and Vornado related to a possible joint venture with or acquisition of Primestone by Vornado. Such a transaction never occurred.\nAt the time the Vornado Loan Agreement was executed, Primestone was already indebted under the Prudential Loan for the principal amount of $40,000,000. The Prudential Loan was also secured by the Units and was senior to the Vornado Loan. The Prudential Loan is governed by an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement between Primestone and Prudential dated as of September 26,2000.\nVornado and Prudential entered into an Intercreditor Agreement on September 26, 2000 to determine their respective rights in the Loans. Primestone signed and was bound by, certain provisions of the Inter-creditor Agreement. Section 15 of the Intercreditor Agreement, however, provides: \u201cThis Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Lenders and no other person or entity shall be entitled to rely on or is intended to receive any benefit under this Agreement.\u201d\nC. The Extension Of The Prudential Loan\nAccording to its terms, the Prudential Loan matured on September 26, 2001. By September 25, 2001, however, Prudential extended its Loan to an \u201cExpiration Date\u201d of November 30, 2001, at the latest. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Vor-nado\u2019s consent was required for this extension. Vornado consented, but explicitly refused to modify the terms of the Vorna-do Loan and received a liability release in return.\nThe day after the Prudential Loan was extended, Primestone wrote Vornado to reiterate that it planned to \u201ccomply with the terms of the [Vornado] Loan Agreement,\u201d and that it would be \u201ccontacting [Vornado] shortly regarding the refinancing of the Loan.\u201d Primestone repeatedly asked Vornado to extend the maturity of its Loan. Several meetings were held related to the Loan around October 10 and 11. Vornado, however, told Primestone that it would not extend the Loan unless Prime-stone repaid at least a part of it. Prime-stone did not agree to such a \u201cpay down,\u201d and the parties never agreed to extend the Loan. On October 24, 2001, Vornado notified Primestone in writing that it was required to repay the Vornado Loan the following day.\nD. Primestone\u2019s Defaults\nWhen the Vornado Loan matured by its terms on October 25, 2001, Primestone failed to pay. This amounted to an Event of Default under Section 15(a) of the Vor-nado Loan Agreement. Vornado notified Primestone of its default in a letter dated October 26, 2001, even though such notice was not required.\nIt was at this point that Primestone took the position that Vornado agreed to extend its Loan beyond October 25, 2001. In a letter dated October 26, Primestone denied that an Event of Default had occurred. Primestone maintained that:\nBy consenting to the extension of the Prudential Loan to a date beyond the original maturity date of the [Vornado Loan] ... we contend that you have extended the maturity date of the [Vor-nado Loan] to November 30, 2001 as well, and that therefore an Event of Default does not in fact exist as of the date hereof.\nVornado responded in a letter dated October 30, 2001, and stated that in its view such an extension had not occurred.\nPrimestone\u2019s failure to pay the Vornado Loan on October 25 also amounted to a default under Section 8.01(s) of the Prudential Credit Agreement. This cross-default allowed Prudential to accelerate its Loan under 8.02 of the Prudential Credit Agreement. Prudential did so on October 25, 2001.\nIn a separate letter on October 26, Prudential issued a \u201cmargin call\u201d to Prime-stone. The Prudential Credit Agreement allowed Prudential to make a margin call if the loan-to-value ratio of the Prudential Loan exceeded 40% calculated based on the price of PGE\u2019s shares. On October 26, the shares closed at $9.85, and the loan-to-value ratio of the Prudential Loan was well in excess of 40%.\nTo satisfy the margin call, Primestone had to provide additional collateral or pay down the Loan to reduce the loan-to-value ratio to no more than 30% within two business days. Primestone failed to do so, and as a result, on October 30, 2001 a second default occurred under the Prudential Credit Agreement. This in turn caused a second Event of Default under the cross-default provision of the Vornado Loan Agreement.\nE. Vomado\u2019s Purchase Of The Prudential Loan\nUnder the Intercreditor Agreement, Vornado was required to obtain the consent of Prudential or purchase the Prudential Loan before enforcing its rights as a secured creditor. On October 31, 2001, after discussions with Prudential, Vornado purchased the Prudential Loan for the net amount then due, $37,978,479.97. The purchase of the Prudential Loan by Vorna-do terminated the Intercreditor Agreement.\nF. Vomado\u2019s Discussions With Cadim,\nThe Private Prime Parties were introduced to Cadim, Inc. in the summer of 2001. Cadim proposed that it lend Prime-stone money to refinance the maturing Vornado Loan, and that Cadim, in a joint venture with Primestone and its affiliates, would acquire the balance of the outstanding units in PGRLP and shares in PGE through a public tender offer. To decide how a potential transaction would proceed, Cadim decided it needed access to confidential information about the assets and liabilities of PGE. Accordingly, Cadim executed certain confidentiality agreements (\u201cSSAs\u201d). Pursuant to SSA No. 1, Cadim agreed that it would use PGE\u2019s confidential information for the sole purpose of pursuing a transaction contemplated with the Private Prime Parties.\nOn August 22, 2001, Cadim, Primestone, PGI, and other Private Prime Parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d). The MOU reflected the agreement of the parties to proceed with a transaction wherein Cadim, together with certain of the Private Prime Parties would acquire all the outstanding shares of PGE and all the outstanding units in PGRLP.\nThe day after signing the MOU, Cadim and PGI submitted a written offer to PGE to acquire 100% of PGE and PGRLP at a price of $14 per share/unit. On August 30, 2001, after several days of negotiations with the independent directors of the PGE Board and their advisors, Cadim and PGI increased its offer to $14.50 per share/unit. It was at this point that Cadim and certain of the Private Prime Parties, including Primestone, entered into the Amended and Restated MOU (the \u201cAmended MOU\u201d). The Amended MOU provided that Cadim would conduct due diligence and negotiate the acquisition of PGE. It also offered to refinance the Vornado and Prudential Loans.\nOn September 14, 2001, Cadim, PGI, PGE, and PGRLP entered into SSA No. 2. SSA No. 2 repeats and reaffirms all of Cadim\u2019s confidentiality and \u201csole use\u201d obligations that are contained in SSA No. 1. Again, Cadim agreed to use the confidential information regarding PGE and PGRLP that it received \u201csolely for the purpose of determining the desirability of the Proposed Transaction\u201d with PGI. The purpose of the amendment was to extend certain time periods in the agreement due to the disruption caused by the national tragedies, which occurred on September 11, 2001.\nAny obligations by Cadim under the Amended MOU terminated, however, if Cadim did not deliver to the PGE Board and the Private Prime Parties a notice regarding its intention to consummate a transaction within 30 days of signing the Amended MOU. No such notice was ever sent. Accordingly, the Amended MOU terminated by its terms on September 29, 2001.\nIn early October 2001, a few days before the Vornado Loan became due, Cadim told Reschke that it wanted to find a partner to join Cadim and the Private Prime Parties in the proposed acquisition of the common shares and common units of PGE and PGRLP. On October 10, 2001, Cadim sent a letter to Reschke on what it said was an \u201cemergency basis.\u201d The letter stated that Reschke must \u201cimmediately acknowledge the letter to permit Mr. Dansereau [vice president of investments for Cadim] the opportunity to meet with several investors in New York to identify a participant to \u2018save owr deal with PGE.\u2019\u201d Accordingly, the letter states \u201ceach party hereby releases Cadim from the confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material,\u201d as that term is defined in SSA No. 4. The letter further declared, \u201cthe [MOU] is hereby null and void and of no further legal effect....\u201d\nThe definition of \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d in SSA No. 4 differs from the definition of \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d in SSA No. 2. SSA No. 4 defines \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d as confidential information about Residential Newco and the PGI Parties.\u201d SSA No. 2 defines \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d as \u201call information regarding PGE, PGLP [PGRLP] and their subsidiaries.... \u201d Reschke signed the October 10 letter, thus permitting Cadim to discuss alternative transactions with third parties. By signing the October 10 letter, Reschke only released Cadim from the confidentiality and \u201csole use\u201d provisions of SSA No. 4. The obligations of SSA No. 2 remained in force.\nOn the evening of October 18, 2001, Danserau telephoned Vornado\u2019s president, Michael Fascitelli. Dansereau notified Fascitelli that he was calling Vornado based on suggestions from Reschke and from Mark Landau, PGE\u2019s financial advis- or. This telephone call marked the first contact between representatives of Cadim and Vornado. The conversation lasted no more than 20 minutes, during which time Fascitelli listened to Dansereau and stated only that Vornado was not interested in acquiring PGE, Primestone or their affiliates.\nFollowing their October 18 telephone call, Fascitelli and Dansereau agreed to meet in person. Between October 18 and October 29, one or two phone calls were made solely for the purpose of arranging the meeting. Representatives of Cadim and Vornado agreed to meet on October 29 in Vornado\u2019s New York City offices. On October 19, 2001, in response to Vornado\u2019s request, PGE wrote a letter to Vornado to consent \u201cto Lender, Vornado Realty, L.P., and Vornado Realty Trust having discussions with Cadim inc. [sic] in connection with a possible strategic transaction relating to [PGE] and [PGRLP].\u201d\nBefore the scheduled meeting on October 29, two important events occurred. First, Cadim and Reschke terminated all negotiations on October 20. According to Primestone, \u201cCadim informed the Private Prime Parties that it would not complete the Global Transaction agreed to in the Amended MOU and Cadim would discontinue any discussions with the Private Prime Parties with regard to the acquisition of PGE Realty or any other aspect of the Amended MOU.\u201d Second, as discussed above, Primestone defaulted on the Vornado and Prudential Loan five days earlier.\nVornado and Cadim representatives met in person for the first time on October 29. Vornado\u2019s objective at this meeting was to sell Cadim all or part of the Loans in order to reduce its exposure to Primestone. Vornado also appeared interested in a potential joint venture with Cadim to acquire all of the outstanding shares of PGE.\nHad Cadim not earlier engaged in significant amounts of due diligence, there would have been little chance that Cadim would have purchased any part of the Loans. Fascitelli testified that Vornado was interested in what due diligence \u201cprocess they took, how much work they had done\u201d so that Cadim \u201cwould have enough information to make a judgment on whatever deal was going to come up, including buying our loan.\u201d Dansereau explained to Vornado the due diligence process Cad-im had already gone through. Cadim eventually provided a written overview of its due diligence procedures to Vornado, entitled: \u201cSummary of the due diligence procedures performed in view of obtaining comfort for the contemplated acquisition of all the outstanding shares of PGE jointly with PGI.\u201d\nVornado asked for such a document because Vornado \u201cwanted to satisfy themselves as to the extent of the due diligence and the scope of the due diligence that we carried out during that period of time from roughly August 23 to October 5\" concerning PGE and PGRLP.\nThe next meeting between Cadim and Vornado was November 2, 2001. At that meeting Dansereau said that Cadim was willing to purchase half of the Prudential and Vornado Loans. Because Cadim had entered into certain standstill agreements with PGE and PGRLP, it could not enter into a loan participation agreement without PGE\u2019s and PGRLP\u2019s consent. Cadim obtained that consent in a Consent and Agreement dated November 16, 2001. On November 19, 2001, Cadim purchased a 50% participation in the Loans for approximately $50 million. In other words, Cad-im purchased the Loans at par.\nG. PGE\u2019s Sale Of Dearborn Center To Bank One\nPGE hoped to sell its Dearborn Center property in Chicago to Bank One by 2003. Before October 23, 2001, however, Bank One president Jamie Dimon informed Reschke that Bank One had decided to reconsider the offer. On October 23, Reschke wrote a letter to Dimon expressing disappointment over Bank One\u2019s decision not to purchase Dearborn Center. Vornado was notified that the potential sale of Dearborn Center to Bank One had fallen through when Fascitelli met with Reschke on October 24.\nOn the basis of Fascitelli\u2019s friendship with Dimon, Primestone alleges that Vor-nado tortiously interfered with PGE\u2019s prospective contract with Bank One. Fascitel-li, however, did not meet with Dimon until after Bank One had decided not to purchase the Dearborn Center. Moreover, Vornado had no motive to interfere with the sale. As a mezzanine lender to this project, Vornado would have benefited from the sale.\nH. The Foreclosure Sale\nWhen Primestone failed to pay the two Loans, Vornado sought to sell the pledged Units in PGRLP in a commercially reasonable manner pursuant to Article 9 of New York\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code. It hired Goldman, Sachs & Co., a prominent investment banking firm, to assist it in developing a marketing process and identifying potential purchasers of the Units. Because the Units were not subject to an established trading market, Vornado believed Section 9 \u2014 610(c) of the New York Uniform Commercial Code prohibited Vor-nado from buying the Units unless they were sold in a public sale. Vornado wanted an opportunity to purchase the Units and felt it might be the most willing and able potential purchaser of the Units. As a result, Vornado decided that Goldman Sachs\u2019s efforts to market the Units would culminate in a public auction.\nOn October 31, 2001, Vornado provided notice to Primestone and the Guarantors that it intended to sell the Units at a public auction scheduled for 4 p.m. on November 20, 2001. A licensed auctioneer was retained. Advertisements marketing the foreclosure sale were published in the New York Times on November 6 and 13, and in the Chicago Tribune on November 7.\nIn conjunction with Goldman Sachs\u2019s marketing efforts, Vornado sought assistance from Primestone and PGE to make the Units more marketable. As discussed above, no more than 9.9% of the Units may be converted into PGE common stock without the consent of the PGE Board. Vornado had obtained the Board\u2019s consent to convert all the Units into shares in a Consent and Agreement dated September 26, 2000 (the \u201c9.9% Waiver\u201d). On October 31, 2001, Vornado wrote to Reschke to request that the PGE Board allow Vorna-do to assign the 9.9% Waiver to third parties. Vornado also asked the PGE Board to release certain entities from certain standstill agreements with PGE so that they could acquire the Units. By a letter dated November 7, 2001, PGE rejected both of these requests.\nWith the assistance of Vornado\u2019s counsel, Goldman Sachs assembled an Information Memorandum regarding PGRLP and the Units. The Information Memorandum only provided publicly available information to potential purchasers. This is due primarily to the fact that Vornado, a creditor, did not have access to much of PGE\u2019s or PGRLP\u2019s confidential information. The Information Memorandum stated that it \u201cdoes not purport to be all-inclusive or to contain all of the information that prospective purchasers may desire.\u201d Cadim and Vornado, however, did possess some material non-public information regarding PGE and PGRLP. The Bidding Agreement, attached as Appendix A to the Information Memorandum, explicitly required potential bidders to acknowledge that, \u201cVornado may have received non-public information from PGE or its affiliates that has not been disclosed to the Bidder and which may be material to the Units and Shares.\u201d\nIn early November, Vornado and Goldman Sachs compiled a list of, and contacted, 51 potential purchasers, including public companies, opportunity funds, private investors, pension funds and advisors (including PGE and the Private Prime Parties). An additional 8 potential purchasers were contacted either through referrals or by unsolicited calls from those bidders. Vornado also requested Primestone to provide a fist of potential purchasers, but no response was ever received. Ultimately, copies of the Information Memorandum were sent to 33 potential purchasers, including PGE and the Private Prime Parties.\nSome of the potential purchasers of the Units contacted by Goldman Sachs stated that they were not interested because of the unavailability of confidential information. For example, Mark Reinisch of Klaff Realty, \u201cexplained that they are not interested in participating in the auction because they do not have access to private information.\u201d Similarly, Nick Rizzo of Westbrook Partners L.L.C. \u201cdid not feel comfortable with only having public information. He explained that they will not be participating in the auction.\u201d\nAlthough Goldman Sachs was responsible for attracting potential purchasers for the Units, it appears to have had relatively little knowledge about what it was actually marketing. Specifically, Adam Rosenberg, Goldman Sachs\u2019s point man for this project, knew very little about PGRLP. PGE\u2019s sole asset is units in PGRPLP, which is an operating partnership. The Units themselves (i.e., the collateral Rosenberg was supposed to market) are limited partnership units in PGRLP, representing 30.1% of all such units. Rosenberg, however, testified that he did not know much about PGRLP. He stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do an evaluation of the operating partnership documents,\u201d and further testified that, \u201cI don\u2019t have any knowledge regarding this particular operating partnership or what it does or doesn\u2019t do.\u201d\nIn a November 8, 2001 letter to Vorna-do, Primestone objected to Vornado\u2019s auction process as \u201ccommercially unreasonable.\u201d It proposed an additional nine-week marketing process (including \u201cmanagement road shows\u201d and property tours), which would culminate in a multi-round \u201cprivate auction.\u201d Primestone was also concerned that the Units, which could amount to over a 31% stake in PGE, were not being marketed as a control block.\nPrimestone filed for bankruptcy on November 19, and Vornado was forced to cancel the foreclosure sale scheduled for the next day. Primestone\u2019s bankruptcy filing was subsequently dismissed as having been filed in bad faith, and Vornado rescheduled the auction for January 25, 2002. Goldman Sachs notified potential purchasers of the new date. Four of these potential purchasers, who had not been previously contacted by Goldman Sachs, were either referred to Goldman Sachs by entities it had previously contacted or were entities who contacted Goldman Sachs on an unsolicited basis. Two potential purchasers did not wish to bid any longer. Based on this information, beginning on or about December 22, Goldman Sachs distributed copies of the updated Information Memorandum to 33 potential purchasers (including PGE and the Private Prime Parties).\nThe January 25 auction was canceled when Primestone obtained a stay pending appeal of the bankruptcy dismissal to the United States District Court. After that court affirmed the dismissal of the petition and vacated the stay, Vornado rescheduled the foreclosure sale for February 25, 2002. Beginning on or about February 11, 2002, Goldman Sachs contacted the potential purchasers to notify them that the foreclosure sale had again been rescheduled. Two of the potential purchasers, who had not been previously contacted, were either referred to Goldman Sachs by entities it had previously contacted or were parties who contacted Goldman Sachs on an unsolicited basis. Vornado also retained its auctioneer again and published advertisements regarding the rescheduled auction in the New York Times and Chicago Tribune on February 14, 2002. Plans for the foreclosure were again canceled when the United States Court of Appeals granted a stay pending appeal on February 15.\nOn March 28, 2002, PGE filed a 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That filing disclosed that Ernst & Young, PGE\u2019s auditor, included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d reservation in their audit report on PGE\u2019s financial statements based on short-term liquidity problems and the ability of PGE\u2019s Series A Preferred stockholders to require PGE to redeem the shares for $40 million. The audit report also disclosed that PGE\u2019s largest tenant was Arthur Anderson and that its failure to continue to pay rent would have an adverse effect on PGE. As a result of the 10-K filing, PGE\u2019s stock price fell significantly. On March 28, the stock closed at $7.66, down $1.49 from the previous day\u2019s close. On April 1, the stock fell to $4.05 in intraday trading, setting a new all-time low for the company.\nOn April 8, a group of stockholders wrote an open letter to the PGE Board calling for Reschke\u2019s resignation. Resch-ke resigned his post as chairman of PGE (although he remains a trustee), and Richard Curto resigned as PGE\u2019s chief executive officer. On April 12, PGE announced that it was cutting 13% of its workforce and that it was not paying dividends to its preferred stockholders. Because of this news, trading of PGE\u2019s shares was halted on the morning of April 12.\nOn April 12, the Court of Appeals conditioned the stay pending appeal on the posting of a $15 million bond by the end of business on April 17. Primestone did not post the bond and the stay was automatically lifted. In preparation for the possibility that the stay might be lifted, Goldman Sachs updated its Information Memorandum based on then-current publicly available information. Vornado, in consultation with Goldman Sachs, decided that if Primestone\u2019s stay was lifted on April 17, rescheduling the foreclosure sale for April 30, 2002 would provide sufficient time to remarket the Units.\nOn April 18, 2002, Vornado gave notice to Primestone and the Guarantors that the foreclosure sale would be held on April 30. Newspaper advertisements were again placed in the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune on April 22. A licensed auctioneer was again retained to conduct the auction. Goldman Sachs again approached all the potential purchasers it had contacted in February to notify them that the foreclosure auction had been rescheduled for 4 p.m. on April 30, 2002. Five additional potential purchasers were contacted, and Goldman Sachs ultimately distributed an updated Information Memorandum to 42 potential purchasers (including PGE and the Private Prime Parties).\nBy April 30, three prospective purchasers in addition to Vornado had expressed interest in bidding at the auction: (1) the Blackstone Group, (2) Friedman Billings & Ramsely (\u201cFBR\u201d), and (3) Cadim. On April 30, representatives of these entities attended the foreclosure sale at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell.\nThe terms of the auction set forth in the final Information Memorandum provided that the sale to the winning bidder would be settled at a time selected by the purchaser up to 30 days after the auction. Because of the resulting exposure to the purchaser\u2019s credit, the terms required bidders to qualify by submitting a financing commitment or other satisfactory evidence of their ability to complete the purchase. Bidders were also required to sign a bidding agreement.\nPrimestone also expressed interest in bidding for the Units. At the auction, Reschke was asked to provide evidence of Primestone\u2019s financial ability to purchase the Units. Reschke produced a photocopy of the April 22 MOU, which he claimed gave Primestone a firm commitment of $105 million from Cadim. This \u201ccommitment\u201d is the same MOU that had been superseded by the August 30 Amended MOU, which in turn expired by its own terms on September 29, 2001. Vornado notified Reschke that the MOU was not a firm financing commitment and that Primestone, therefore, was not qualified to bid.\nThe auctioneer then read a description of the Units and began the auction. After he failed to attract any other bids, Vorna-do opened the bidding at $8.85 per Unit, which was the closing price of PGE\u2019s shares on the day of the foreclosure sale. No further bids were made. The Units were thus sold to Vornado for an aggregate price of $66,339,856.55.\nI. The Deficiency\nPrimestone was indebted to Vornado on April 30, 2002 for $116,111,323. The indebtedness on the Vornado Loan included the $62,000,000 principal, an exit fee of $2,102,240 and accrued interest at an annual rate of 16% before maturity and 20% after maturity. All overdue amounts, including principal, interest, fees and reimbursable expenses, are subject to the 20% interest rate when an Event of Default has occurred. The Vornado Loan Agreement also requires Primestone to pay \u201call out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement\u201d and related agreements. As of April 30, Vornado had spent $2,499,573 in enforcing its rights under the Vornado Loan Agreement. Indebtedness on the Vornado Loan was reduced by $1,040,873 previously received pursuant to Vornado\u2019s security interest.\nPrimestone\u2019s indebtedness on the Prudential Loan includes the unpaid principal (net of cash received by Prudential pursuant to its security interest), late fees and accrued interest at the LIBOR rate plus 1.5% until maturity and LIBOR plus 7.5% after maturity. The result is remaining indebtedness under the Prudential Loan to Vornado by Primestone in the amount of $40,848,356. Thus after including the proceeds from the foreclosure sale, Prime-stone still remains indebted to Vornado for the net amount of $49,771,467.\nIII.\nVornado commenced this action on November 19, 2001. The action was stayed on the same day as a result of Prime-stone\u2019s filing of a bankruptcy petition. The stay remained in effect until the Bankruptcy Court dismissed Primestone\u2019s bankruptcy petition for bad faith on December 19, 2001. During the periods from January 4 through February 5 and February 15 through April 17, 2002, stays were reinstated pending appeal by the United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals.\nOn December 20, 2001, Primestone and its affiliates amended their complaint in an action pending in Illinois to assert claims against Vornado, Vornado Realty Trust and Vornado Realty L.P. Accompanying this amended complaint was an application for a temporary restraining order to prevent Vornado from conducting the rescheduled foreclosure auction. Vornado then requested that this court prevent Primestone and its affiliates from interfering with the foreclosure sale through proceedings in other courts. On December 20, this court granted the request and issued a temporary restraining order.\nOn February 13, 2002, Primestone counterclaimed against Vornado and its affiliates in this court. Primestone also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the foreclosure sale then scheduled for February 25. After the Court of Appeals granted Primestone\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal on February 15, however, Primestone declined to proceed in this court with its motion for a preliminary injunction.\nAfter the stay pending appeal terminated on April 17, 2002, Primestone again tried to pursue its motion for a preliminary injunction on the ground that Vornado was not conducting a commercially reasonable foreclosure. When this court indicated that Primestone would have to post a substantial bond as a condition of any grant of injunction, Primestone chose to withdraw its motion for a preliminary injunction. Primestone subsequently filed an amended counterclaim on August 19, 2002.\nVornado currently seeks a judicial determination that it is entitled to enforce the terms of its loan agreements. Vornado also seeks a declaration that its foreclosure auction was conducted in a commercially reasonably manner, and that it was the winner of the auction. Finally, Vornado seeks summary judgment on all 14 of Primestone\u2019s counterclaims.\nPrimestone\u2019s first amended counterclaim seeks a declaration that it won the foreclosure auction. Count II alleges tor-tious interference with a prospective contract between PGE and Bank One as well as tortious interference with various relations between Cadim and Primestone. Count III alleges fraud in the inducement based on alleged representations Vornado made prior to execution of the Vornado loan. Count IV alleges fraud based on Vornado\u2019s consent to the extension of the Prudential Loans. Count V alleges fraud based on misrepresentations during the term of the Vornado Loan. Count VI alleges a breach of the Prudential Loan by Vornado when it accelerated payments. Count VII alleges a breach of the Vornado Loan. Count VIII alleges a breach of the Intercreditor Agreement. Count IX alleges a breach of the implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. Count X alleges promissory estoppel based on statements made by Vornado prior to the execution of the Vornado Loan. Count XI alleges a breach of fiduciary duty by Vornado. Count XII seeks a constructive trust, but does not allege any misconduct giving rise to such relief. Count XIII seeks a declaration that the foreclosure sale was commercially unreasonable. Count XIV alleges that Vornado failed to comply with Revised Article 9 of the New York U.C.C.\nIV.\nThe legal standards for summary judgment are well settled. Pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 56, summary judgment should be granted where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. When considering a motion for summary judgment, the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that no material question of fact exists. \u201cWhen a moving party has properly supported its motion, however, the non-moving party must submit admissible evidence sufficient to generate a factual issue for trial or suffer an adverse judgment.\u201d\nY.\nA. Vomado Is Entitled To The Enforcement Of Its Loans\nThere is no dispute that Vornado loaned $62 million to Primestone pursuant to the Vornado Loan Agreement or that Vornado acquired a loan of $40 million that Primestone owed to Prudential under the Prudential Loan Agreement. Prime-stone failed to make required payments on either Loan when they came due. Prime-stone argues that an Event of Default did not occur, however, because \u201cthe Vornado Loan was, in effect, extended until November 80, 2001 by virtue of the Prudential Loan extension. This challenge is without merit.\nAs part of the extension of the Prudential Loan, Vornado\u2019s consent was required. Vornado gave such a consent, but Vornado explicitly reserved its own rights under the Vornado Loan Agreement:\nThe Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Loan Agreement and other Credit Documents remain in full force and effect. The Borrower also acknowledges and agrees that Vomado has not waived, and shall not be deemed to have waived, any current or future Default or Events of Default under the Loan Agreement....\nAccording to Primestone, \u201cPrimestone reasonably believed that Vornado could not claim a default until November 30, 2001\u201d because Section 3(a) of the Intercre-ditor Agreement prevented Vornado from accepting repayment on its Loan until repayment was made on the Prudential Loan. Any assertion of Primestone\u2019s rights under this Section of the Intercreditor Agreement, however, is foreclosed by Section 15 of the Agreement. Section 15 explicitly provides that the Agreement \u201cis solely for the benefit of the Lenders and no other person or entity shall be entitled to rely on\u201d it. Primestone accepted this provision by signing the Agreement.\nPrimestone counters by arguing that it does have certain enforceable rights under the Intercreditor Agreement. This may be true, but those rights are not enforceable against Vornado or Prudential. None of the sections Primestone cites in the Intercreditor Agreement-Sections 2(b)(ii)(A), 2(c)(ii), 3(g) and 19-creates any rights that Primestone could enforce against either Prudential or Vornado.\nThis court is bound to give effect to the unambiguous language of Section 15. Under New York law, a contract that declares it is \u201cfor the sole and exclusive benefit of the named parties\u201d cannot be enforced or relied upon by a third party. The Intercreditor Agreement was such a contract. Primestone is a third party to the contract. Thus, Primestone cannot enforce or rely upon it.\nPrimestone\u2019s failure to pay the Vornado Loan at maturity amounted to an Event of Default under the Vornado Loan without any demand or other action by Vornado. Further, Section 8.01(s) of the Prudential Credit Agreement provided that any default under the Vornado Loan Agreement constituted an Event of Default under the Prudential Loan Agreement. Finally, Section 8.02 of the Prudential Credit Agreement allowed Prudential to accelerate its loan upon an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(s). This is essentially what Prudential did.\nThe sections of the Intercreditor Agreement that Primestone relies upon did not suspend or waive Events of Default under either Loan. Section 3(g) of the Vornado Loan Agreement titled \u201cExercise of Remedies\u201d states that, \u201cso long as any Senior Indebtedness is outstanding, [Vornado] ... shall not exercise any rights or remedies with respect to an Event of Default under\u201d the Vornado Loan Agreement. The Agreement only prohibits Vornado from exercising its remedies when an Event of Default occurs. It does not prevent an actual Event of Default from occurring. Instead, because an Event of Default occurred under the Vornado Loan Agreement, it also constituted an Event of Default under the Prudential Credit Agreement, and Prudential had the right to exercise remedies against Primestone following such an Event of Default.\nSection 5 of the Amendment to the Prudential Credit Agreement contemplates that Primestone might pay the Vornado Loan before the Prudential Loan. This Section amended the definition of \u201cExpiration Date\u201d in the Prudential Credit Agreement as follows:\n\u201cExpiration Date\u201d means the earlier of (i) the repayment of the Vornado Loan, (ii) November 30, 2001, or (iii) the date on which a Change of Control of any of the Borrower, any Guarantor, Prime, or the REIT has occurred.\nClause (i) of Section 5 explicitly identifies the possibility that Primestone might pay the Vornado Loan before November 30, 2001. If the Vornado Loan was not due until November 30, as Primestone alleges, clause (i) would not have been needed.\nThere is simply no basis to conclude that either the Vornado Loan or the Prudential Loan were absolutely extended to November 80. The amendment to the Prudential Credit Agreement and Vornado\u2019s consent to the amendment essentially extended the Prudential Loan to October 25, 2001 unless Primestone obtained an extension of the Vornado Loan. Vornado did not extend the Vornado Loan, and as a result, both Loans were due on October 25.\nAn alternative allegation by Primestone is that it \u201creasonably relied upon Vorna-do\u2019s consent and the Intercreditor Agreement to conclude, to [its] detriment, that the expiration date of the Vornado Loan had also been extended until November 30, 2001.\u201d The undisputed facts, however, appear to contradict such an allegation. Primestone appeared to understand that Vornado had not extended its Loan. On September 26, the day after the amendment to the Prudential Credit Agreement was executed, Primestone wrote to assure Vornado that it \u201cintend[ed] to comply with the terms of the Loan Agreement.\u201d On October 10, Primestone provided a letter to Vornado that stated:\nThe Prime Group, Inc. (\u201cPrime\u201d) currently owns 8,322,990 common shares and convertible partnership units in Prime Group Realty Trust (N.Y.SE.-PGE), which represents a 31.2% interest in PGE on a fully-diluted basis (the \u201cControl Block\u201d). Prime is seeking an institutional investor (the \u201cInvestor\u201d) to purchase a 50% interest in this Control Block, the proceeds of which will be used by Prime to retire approximately $66.0 million of indebtedness maturing on October 25, 2001, that is secured by a pledge of the Control Block that is subordinate to a $40.0 million margin loan.\u201d\nPrimestone\u2019s repeated requests for an extension provide further evidence that Primestone understood that the Vornado Loan had not been extended. Fascitelli testified that after September 11, Reschke asked for an extension of the Vornado Loan \u201c[e]very time he talked to me.\u201d Fascitelli further stated: \u201cWe told him consistently that we would not extend it unless we got a pay down.\u201d For all these reasons, the court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact related to the extension of the Vornado Loan, and summary judgment will be granted as to Counts V through IX of Vornado\u2019s amended complaint. Furthermore, by Primestone\u2019s own admission, granting summary judgment on this issue in favor of Vornado necessarily negates Counts IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and XIV of Primestone\u2019s counterclaim. Therefore the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Vornado on those counterclaims.\nB. Vomado\u2019s Foreclosure Auction Was Conducted In A Commercially Reasonable Manner\nUnder New York law, a \u201csecured party seeking a deficiency judgment from the debtor after sale of the collateral bears the burden of showing that the sale was made in a \u2018commercially reasonable\u2019 manner.\u201d Moreover, even when confronted with a \u201cvery close question of whether defendants have raised a question of fact\u201d regarding commercial reasonableness, courts have followed the \u201crule that summary judgment should be denied\u201d whenever \u201cthere is doubt as to the existence of a triable issue or when the issue is arguable.\u201d This stringent standard, however, has not precluded courts applying New York law from granting summary judgment when they found there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the commercial reasonableness of a foreclosure sale.\nPrimestone complains the foreclosure auction was not performed in a commercially reasonable manner. New York U.C.C. Section 9-627 establishes guidelines for the determination of commercial reasonableness. Under subsection (a), the fact that a greater amount of money could have been \u201cobtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not itself sufficient\u201d to establish that the disposition was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. Subsection (b) provides that a \u201cdisposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made ... (2) at the price current in any recognized market at the time of disposition.\u201d\nPrimestone\u2019s first objection to Vornado\u2019s foreclosure auction was Vornado\u2019s belief that the Units needed to be sold at a public auction in order for it to make a bid for the Units. Although, such a requirement exists, Primestone argues that Vornado should have sought a private sale anyway because the New York U.C.C. generally \u201cencourages private dispositions on the assumption that they frequently will result in higher realization on collateral for the benefit of all concerned.\u201d Such a generalized policy must give way in this circumstance, however, because there can be little doubt that Vornado was one of the most interested and able potential purchasers of the Units. By conducting a private sale, and thus eliminating Vornado as a potential purchaser, the price for the Units had the potential to be much lower than the ultimate selling price.\nPrimestone also argues that the price attained for the Units was unreasonably low. At the auction, the Units sold at a price equivalent to the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the foreclosure sale. Primestone admits that the Units were the economic equivalent of PGE shares. Their value, therefore, should be considered roughly equivalent to the PGE share price on that day. In fact, there can be little doubt that the Units\u2019 value was less than the value of PGE\u2019s publicly traded shares. Although the Units were the economic equivalent of PGE shares, they lacked significant voting rights. The Units only represented limited partnership interests and could not participate in the management of the partnership. PGE was still the General Partner of PGRLP. Thus, to obtain control of the PGRLP, one must obtain control of PGE. Absent a 9.9% Waiver, however, it was impossible to attain control of PGE. There is absolutely no indication such a waiver would have been given.\nPrimestone argues the Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) of the Units was $15 per Unit, which provides further evidence of the unreasonable price obtained in the auction. This argument is unpersuasive. NAV could only be realized, if at all, in a sale or disposition of PGRLP. There is no indication of any plans to liquidate PGRLP\u2019s assets or that the real estate in PGRLP\u2019s portfolio is easily liquidated. That is the reason, market price in this case could diverge significantly from NAV.\nIt is also the case that the procedures employed by Vornado were reasonable. Goldman Sachs was hired to do the marketing, and the efforts undertaken by Goldman Sachs were \u201cconsistent in all material respects with actions it has taken in the past in connection with other marketing processes relating to real estate-related companies and equity interests therein.\u201d The only major flaw in the auction was the fact that only Vornado was privy to inside information relating to PGE. Primestone could certainly have chosen to provide such inside information to potential purchasers, yet it refused to do so. Vornado possessed some inside information, but it had no sense of how rehable it actually was. It also had no way to obtain any additional inside information.\nFor all these reasons, Vornado is entitled to a declaration that the foreclosure sale was conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, and Count XIII of the counterclaim will be dismissed.\nPrimestone did not win the auction and Count I of the counterclaim will be dismissed as well. Primestone was properly disqualified from bidding at the foreclosure sale because it could not produce a valid financing commitment. In its brief in opposition to summary judgment, Primestone did not attempt to defend this claim. Therefore, Primestone should be deemed to have waived it. Since, Prime-stone could not bid at the auction, and Vornado was the highest bidder, Vornado will be declared the winner of the auction.\nC. Primestone\u2019s Tortious Interference Counterclaims Must Be Dismissed\nUnder New York law, a claim of tortious interference with contractual relations consists of four elements: \u201c(1) the existence of a contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2) defendant\u2019s knowledge of the contract; (3) defendant\u2019s intentional inducement of the third party to breach or otherwise render performance impossible; and (4) damages to plaintiff.\u201d\n1. Primestone Concedes That Vornado Did Not Tortiously Interfere With PGE\u2019s Prospective Contractual Relations With Bank One\nPrimestone\u2019s deposition of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of Bank One, has conclusively refuted Primestone\u2019s allegation that on \u201cinformation and belief\u201d Vornado caused Bank One to terminate discussions with PGE over the sale of the Dearborn Center. Presumably for this reason, Prime-stone has abandoned this counterclaim. The court will therefore dismiss Count II of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim to the extent that it alleges tortious interference with Bank One.\n2. Vornado Did Not Tortiously Interfere With The SSAs\nAnother aspect of Primestone\u2019s tortious interference claim relates to the \u201csole use\u201d provisions in the confidentiality clauses of the SSAs entered into by Cadim. A though four separate SSAs were executed, only SSA No. 2 and SSA No. 4 are relevant to this litigation. These are the \u201cAmended and Restated\u201d versions of the other two SSAs. Under Illinois law, which controls all of these agreements, each Amended and Restated agreement superseded the original because it dealt with identical subject matter. Thus, there are only two SSAs that could be the subject of a tortious interference claim.\nVornado could not have induced Cadim to breach the sole use clause in SSA No. 2 because PGE expressly waived that provision to permit Cadim to have discussions with Vornado. The only Evaluation Materials referred to in SSA No. 2 come from PGE, and not Primestone or its affiliates. On November 16, 2001, PGE executed a Consent and Agreement that permitted Cadim to enter into discussions with Vornado despite the terms of SSA No. 2. The Consent and Agreement states:\n4. Confidentiality Agreement and SSA. ... the REIT and the Partnership hereby acknowledge and agree (i) that the Cadim entities may engage in discussions with, or may at some point entertain the possibility of a joint proposal together with, Vornado Realty Trust (or Vornado Realty Trust and one or more of its control affiliates), regarding a possible strategic transaction involving the Partnership and the REIT....\nPrimestone is further precluded from asserting tortious interference with respect to SSA No. 2 because it has failed to adequately establish that Vornado was the proximate cause of Cadim\u2019s breach of contract. To prevail on its claim, Prime-stone must show \u201cthere would not have been a breach but for the activities of [Vornado].\u201d\nEvidence that the third party intended to breach its contract will defeat an action for tortious interference with contractual relations. In Huggins v. Povitch, the plaintiffs tortious interference claims were dismissed because the record clearly demonstrated that the third party at whom the tortious conduct was allegedly directed \u201cneeded no inducement from defendant to breach the confidentiality agreement.\u201d Similarly, in John Paul Mitchell Systems, the court dismissed the plaintiffs claims where, as in Huggins, the third party \u201cneeded virtually no inducement to [breach the sales contract]\u201d. Although \u201c[the defendant] was certainly a willing buyer,\u201d its actions were not deemed the proximate cause of the breach of contract.\nThe facts of this litigation are highly analogous to those of the cases above. Primestone admits that by October 19, there was \u201cno doubt about Cadim\u2019s plan to abandon its promise to use the information concerning PGE Realty solely to do a deal with the Private Prime Parties.\u201d Prime-stone does not allege any interference by Vornado through this date. Nor does it dispute that the first discussion between Vornado and Cadim about the possibility of doing a transaction together did not occur until October 29. Thus, even if Primestone\u2019s allegations could be proven, they would demonstrate, at most, that Vor-nado was simply a \u201cwilling seller,\u201d and that Cadim needed no inducement from Vorna-do to allegedly breach its confidentiality obligations with respect to SSA No. 2.\nPrimestone also failed to establish that Vornado tortiously interfered with SSA No. 4 because Primestone \u201crelease[d] Cadim from the confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material\u201d in the October 10 letter Reschke sent to Cadim, more than a week before Vornado\u2019s first contact with Cadim. Primestone attempts to defend this claim by arguing that the October 10 letter did not apply to the \u201csole use\u201d subsection of the section entitled \u201cConfidentiality\u201d in SSA No. 4. The court cannot accept such an interpretation of the October 10 letter and SSA No. 4.\nThe \u201csole use\u201d provisions is merely the second clause of the confidentiality provision in SSA No. 4:\n2. Confidentiality. Cadim agrees that (a) all information regarding Residential Newco and the PGI Parties furnished to Cadim, whether prior to or after the date of this Agreement, in connection with Cadim\u2019s consideration of the Proposed Transaction (the \u201cEvaluation Materials\u201d) will be kept strictly confidential, and (b) the Evaluation Material will be used solely for the purpose of determining the desirability of the Proposed Transaction....\nNotably, the October 10 letter uses the plural term \u201cconfidentiality obligations,\u201d recognizing that there is more than one confidentiality obligation. Thus, the unambiguous language of the October 10 letter and SSA No. 4 precludes Primestone\u2019s allegation that the October 10 letter did not waive the \u201csole use\u201d provision. For these reasons, the court will dismiss Count II of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim to the extent it alleges tortious interference with any of the SSAs.\n3. Primestone Did Not Tortiously Interfere With Primestone\u2019s Prospective Contractual Relationship With Cadim\nUnder New York law, the elements of a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relationships are: \u201c(1) [the prospects of] business relations with a third party; (2) the defendant\u2019s interference with those business relations; (3) the defendant acted with the sole purpose of harming the plaintiff or used dishonest, unfair, or improper means; and (4) injury to the business relationship.\u201d In other words, Primestone must demonstrate \u201cwrongful means\u201d directed at the prospective contract, and that \u201cbut for the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct,\u201d the plaintiff would have entered into a contract with the third party.\nPrimestone cannot dispute that: (1) the Amended MOU was terminated by a letter agreement dated October 10, 2001; (2) Cadim terminated all discussions with Primestone by October 20 at the latest; and (3) the only contact between Vornado and Cadim before October 20 consisted of a single telephone call initiated by Cadim on October 18, 2001, in which Yornado did not attempt to discourage Cadim from engaging in a potential transaction with Primestone.\nPrimestone argues that Vornado interfered with its business relations with Cad-im before Primestone even began negations with Cadim. This was purportedly accomplished by Vornado \u201cconcealing] its true intentions to prevent Primestone from refinancing the Vornado loans and to control and/or acquire PGE Realty.\u201d This plan was allegedly accomplished by (1) \u201cprofessing] eagerness to invest in the Private Prime Parties and/or acquire PGE Realty\u201d; and (2) bargaining for a \u201cNo Shop\u201d provision in the Vornado Loan Agreement. All of these allegations, however, involve events that occurred before the Vornado Loan Agreement, which was executed in September 2000. Further the allegations have almost no connection to Cadim, which did not begin negotiations with PGE until the summer of 2001. Interestingly, Cadim is never even referenced in Primestone\u2019s three-page discussion of Vornado\u2019s alleged tor-tious interference with a prospective relationship between Cadim and Primestone.\nPrimestone has failed to explain how any of this alleged conduct was intentionally directed at any potential business relationship with Cadim. Primestone has failed to show business relations with Cadim or Vornado\u2019s interference with those business relations. Because Primestone cannot show that any of Vornado\u2019s alleged acts were directed at Primestone\u2019s relationship with Cadim, Primestone cannot possibly demonstrate that it would have entered into a contract with Cadim \u201cbut for\u201d such conduct. Dansereau\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, makes clear that Cadim\u2019s choice to not engage in a transaction with Primestone had nothing to do with Vornado:\nQ. Were you still trying to do a deal with PGI when you called Mr. Fas-citelli?\nA. No, no, we were not.\nQ. Why not?\nA. One, we could not support the structure that was contemplated in the MOU and therefore short of revisiting the deal entirely, it was virtually impossible for us to do the deal and maintain the private REIT structure which is fundamental in our transaction.\nIn addition, we lost faith in Mr. Reschke\u2019s ability to, even on a restructured basis, participate in a transaction with Cadim.\nThus, the undisputed facts show that Cadim had abandoned discussions PGE and its affiliates for reasons of its own. Because there is no evidence that Vornado intentionally interfered with any relationship between Cadim and PGE and its affiliates, the court will dismiss Count II of the amended counterclaim to the extent it alleges tortious interference with prospective business relations.\nD. Primestone\u2019s Fraud In The Inducement, Promissory Estoppel And Fraud Counterclaims Must Be Dismissed\nCount III of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim attempts to state a claim for fraud against Vornado by inducing Primestone to enter into the Vornado Loan Agreement. This was allegedly done by Vornado\u2019s indication that it would continue to negotiate an equity investment with PGE or the Private Prime Parties. This argument fails as a matter of law, however, because Section 17(h) of the Vornado Loan Agreement contained an integration clause that provided that the Agreement \u201csupersede^] all prior agreements and understanding, both written and oral, among the parties. Thus, any alleged promise by Vornado that predated and related to the Vornado Loan Agreement is not actionable. In addition, Primestone has released any possible claims against Vornado. This is due to the October 8, 2001 letter, wherein Vornado consented to the extension of the Prudential Loan and received a release of liability in return for such consent. Finally, mere statements of future intent (as is the case here), without more, are not sufficient to establish fraud. For all these reasons, the court will dismiss Count III of Prime-stone\u2019s amended counterclaim.\nFor similar reasons, Count X of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim, which alleges promissory estoppel related to statements made before the Vornado Loan was executed, must fail. \u201cThe elements of promissory estoppel are clear: a clear and unambiguous promise; a reasonable and foreseeable reliance by the party to whom the promise is made; and an injury sustained by the party asserting the estoppel by reason of his reliance.\u201d There is no need to analyze the actual merits of Primestone\u2019s claim, however, because any acts or omissions on Vornado\u2019s part before the execution of the October 8 letter are not actionable for the reasons already discussed. Accordingly the court will dismiss Count X of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim.\nCount V of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim is a claim of fraud based on alleged (but unidentified) statements by Vornado during the life of the Loan related to its intent to enter into an equity investment with PGE or the Private Prime Parties. This claim must fail for two reasons. First, the claim is contradicted by Primestone\u2019s own allegation that \u201cafter the Vornado Loan was made, Vornado Realty refused to proceed with either an equity investment in the Private Prime Parties or an acquisition of PGE.\u201d Second, Prime-stone does not allege that any of these statements were made after the October 8 Vornado consent. Accordingly, even if Vornado had made certain statements before this point, they are not actionable because Vornado had received a valid general release. Therefore, this court will dismiss Count V of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim.\nE. Primestone\u2019s Breach Of Fiduciary Duty Counterclaim Must Be Dismissed\nCount XI of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim seeks to state a claim against Vornado for breaches of fiduciary duties owed to Vornado. As a threshold matter, however, Primestone must allege that it was a party to whom a duty was owed by Vornado. It has failed to do so.\nPrimestone does not dispute that under New York law \u201cno fiduciary duty aris[es] out of the contractual arms\u2019 length debtor and creditor relationship\u201d between a borrower and a lender. However, Primestone argues that by virtue of the amount of control Vornado exercised over it, such duties have been created. To demonstrate this control, Primestone points out that Vornado was appointed to be Primestone\u2019s attorney-in-fact for purposes of protecting its interests in the collateral. However, this appointment amounts to no more than a power coupled with an interest. A power coupled with an interest is a power that \u201cis held for the benefit of a person other than the power giver.\u201d Because this power was not held for the benefit of the debtor, no fiduciary relationship results from its grant. This provision was intended solely to protect Vornado\u2019s interest in the collateral.\nNext, Primestone claims that \u201cno shop\u201d and \u201cfirst offer\u201d provisions in the Loans creates fiduciary duties owed by Vornado to Primestone. This is because the provisions made it hard to refinance the Loans. \u201cNo shop\u201d and \u201cfirst offer\u201d terms in loans, however, have previously been approved by New York courts. The \u201cno shop\u201d and \u201cfirst offer\u201d terms merely protect Vorna-do\u2019s economic interests. Furthermore, Primestone admits that neither the \u201cno shop\u201d nor the \u201cfirst offer\u201d provision actually prevented Primestone from refinancing. Vornado simply did not exert enough control over Primestone\u2019s business, assets, and finances to demonstrate that this court should impose fiduciary obligations on Vor-nado in this instance. Therefore, the court will dismiss Count XI of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim.\nF. Primestone Is Not Entitled To A Constructive Trust\nCount XII of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim seeks the imposition of a constructive trust on the Units. For a court to impose a constructive trust, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201c(1) a confidential or fiduciary relationship, (2) a promise, (3) a transfer in reliance on such promise, and (4) unjust enrichment.\u201d Primestone has not attempted to establish any of these elements. Vornado addressed this problem in its brief, and Primestone failed to respond. Therefore this court will dismiss Count XII of Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim.\nVI.\nFor the foregoing reasons, Vornado\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Counts IV through IX of its amended complaint is GRANTED. Vornado\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Primestone\u2019s amended counterclaim is also GRANTED. IT IS SO ORDERED.\n. Examples of events where holders of the Units could vote on a transaction involving PGRLP include mergers, sales of all the assets of the partnership, or bankruptcy.\n. Section 5 of the First Amendment to Prudential Credit Agreement provided:\n\"Expiration Date\u201d means the earlier of (i) the repayment of the Vornado Loan, (ii) November 30, 2001, or (iii) the date on which a Change of Control of any of the Borrower, any Guarantor, Prime, or the REIT has occurred.\n. Vornado\u2019s written consent contained the following statement:\nThe Borrower acknowledges that the Loan Agreement and other Credit Documents remain in full force and effect. The Borrower also acknowledges and agrees that Vornado has not waived, and shall not be deemed to have waived, any current or future Default or Events of Default.\nThe written consent also included a release of any claims Primestone might have had against Vornado:\nThe Borrower ... does hereby acknowledge that there are no valid defenses to any obligation of any Borrower Party under any of the Credit Documents, and the Borrower, for itself and for each other Borrower Party, does hereby unconditionally release and absolutely forever discharge Vornado ... from any and all claims, demands, actions, omissions, debts, liabilities, obligations, accounts and causes of action of every kind and nature whatsoever whether related to (a) the Loan and the Loan Agreement and/or the other Credit Documents, or (b) otherwise, whether presently know or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which Borrower Party had or now has against Lender Party.\n. PGI is a limited partner of Primestone and is the administrative member of PG/Prime-stone, L.L.C., which is the general partner of Primestone. PGI is one of the Private Prime Parties.\n. There is also an SSA No. 3 dated August 23, 2001, among Cadim, PGI, Primestone, Prime-group VI, L.P., Prime L.P., PGLLC, and Mr. Reschke (the president, CEO and chairman of PGI). SSA No. 4 is dated August 30, 2001, and is executed by the same parties. See note 43 infra for a summery of the SSAs.\n.The letter states: \"unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms have the meaning given them in the [SSA], dated as of August 30, 2001, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated September 14, 2001.... \u201d That agreement is SSA No. 4.\n.

Rosenberg Aff. Ex. B at Appendix A.\n. Rosenberg Dep. at 134-36; Rosenberg Aff. Ex. 6.\n. Rosenberg Dep. 138-41; Rosenberg Aff. Ex. 6.\n.Rosenberg testified:\nMy experience with REITS set up to have operating partnerships in general is that they would have some rights with respect to the operating partnership, but for this particular operating partnership I don\u2019t know what the nature of those rights is or whether there are any rights or whether those rights include voting rights or other types of rights.\nRosenberg Dep. at 78-79.\n. Id. at 79.\n. Id. at 80.\n. Primestone further objected to the auction procedures as \"commercially unreasonable\u201d by letters from Reschke dated January 3, 2002, April 23, 2002, and April 29, 2002.\n. The representative from the Blackstone Group participated by telephone.\n. Silverstein Aff. Ex. 1 at \u00a7 9(c).\n. To the extent Vornado relies on facts outside the pleadings, this court will apply a summary judgment standard. To the extent Vornado seeks to dismiss counterclaims strictly based on the pleadings, Chancery Court Rule 12(b)(6) standards will be applied.\n. See Williams v. Geier, 671 A.2d 1368, 1375 (Del.1996).\n. See Tanzer v. Int\u2019l General Indus., Inc., 402 A.2d 382, 385 (Del.Ch.1979) (citing Judah v. Delaware Trust Co., 378 A.2d 624, 632 (Del.1977)).\n. Id.; Ch. Ct. R. 56(e).\n. With the exception of the SSAs (which are explicitly governed by Illinois law), New York law applies to all of Vornado\u2019s claims and all of Primestone\u2019s counterclaims. The contract claims related to the Prudential Loan are subject to New York law because Primestone agreed that New York law would apply in Section 9.11 of the Prudential Loan Agreement. All the other claims are also subject to New York law because the parties chose New York law to govern certain contracts, the collateral was located in New York, and New York was the situs of most of the alleged acts on which Primestone\u2019s claims are based. Accordingly, New York is the state with the most significant relationship to these claims and counterclaims. See, e.g., IM2 Merchandising & Mfg., Inc. v. Tirex Corp., 2000 WL 1664168, at *10 n. 49 (Del.Ch. Nov.2, 2000) (\"Because the parties explicitly contracted under the laws of Quebec, Canada and all the relevant events transpired in Quebec, Canada, the most significant relationship test suggests that the laws of Quebec, Canada govern the plaintiffs [sic] tort and contract claims\u201d).\n. Pl. Amend. Countercl. at 36.\n. Silverstein Aff. Ex. 5 at 1 (emphasis added). In addition, the Vornado Loan Agreement could not have been modified by Vornado's consent agreement. Section 17(h) of the Vomado Loan Agreement provides that \"[t]his Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a written agreement signed by the parties.\u201d Silverstein Aff. Ex. 1 at 65. Vomado\u2019s consent is only between Primestone and Vornado. It does not involve the Guarantors (who must be a signatory to any amendment) and therefore does not amend the Vornado Loan Agreement.\n. Pl. Br. at 83.\n. Silverstein Aff. Ex. 3.\n.The court finds there is no ambiguity that Primestone was intended to be excluded from enforcing any part of the Intercreditor Agreement because Primestone is defined in Section 15 as a non-party. Section 15 proceeds to state that: \"The parties hereto specifically reserve any and all of their respective rights, security interests, and rights to assert security interest as against the Company [i.e., Prime-stone] and any third parties.\u201d Silverstein Aff. Ex. 3 \u00a7 15; see also id. \u00a7 1 (defining Primestone Investment Partners L.P. as \"the Company\u201d).\n. A.H.A. Gen. Constr., Inc. v.

U.C.C. \u00a7 9-610(c) provides that \u201ca secured party may purchase collateral: (1) at a public disposition; or (2) at a private disposition only if the collateral is of a kind that is customarily sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations\u201d.\n. NY U.C.C. \u00a7 9-610 Official Comment 2.\n. There is no requirement that actual market value for assets sold in foreclosure must be obtained. New York courts have \"held that bids ranging from as low as 30% ... of market value are not commercially unreasonable.\u201d First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Romano, 676 N.Y.S.2d at 164.\n. Section 7.1 of PGRLP's partnership agreement demonstrates that PGE had complete control over the operations of the partnership:\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, or as required by applicable law, all management powers over the business and affairs of the partnership are fully, exclusively and completely vested in the Managing General Partner, and no other Partner shall have any right to transact business for, participate in the management or decisions of, or exercise control or management power over the business and affairs of, the Partnership.\nFurthermore, Section 7.3 provides that limited partners have no voice in the selection of the Managing General Partner: \"The Managing General Partner may not be removed by the other Partners with or without cause, except with the consent of the Managing General Partner.\u201d Thus, without assurance that a potential purchaser of the Units would be granted a 9.9% Waiver, it is impossible to assume that the Units sold at the foreclosure auction amounted to a control block.\n.

Primestone at this time will not rely upon those allegations\u201d).\n. The four SSAs are summarized by the following table:\n. See Dolezal v. Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, S.C., 266 Ill.App.3d 1070, 204 Ill.Dec. 10, 640 N.E.2d 1359, 1366 (1994) (\u201cA complete, valid, written contract merges and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements dealing with the same subject matter\u201d) (quotation omitted). The only difference in the superseding versions of the SSAs are the dates.\n. Vornado could not have interfered with SSA No. 1 or SSA No. 3 before the dates in which they were superseded (September 14 and August 30, 2001, respectively) because it is undisputed that the first contact between Vornado and Cadim occurred on October 18, 2001.
