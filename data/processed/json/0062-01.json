As of the date of the Board's Report and Recommendation, respondent had failed to file an affidavit pursuant to D.C.App. R. XI, \u00a7 14(g), and hence, for purposes of reinstatement, the six-month period had not yet begun to run under D.C.App. R. XI, \u00a7 16(c).\n. Indeed, as in the prior disciplinary matter, respondent has not participated in the instant proceedings in any way at any level.",
