After consideration of the arguments of counsel for all parties as well as a consideration of the record, it is the conclusion of the court that no cause has been shown.\nTherefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is denied and dismissed, and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.\nMURRAY, J., and SHEA, J., did not participate.",
