        "text": "ORDER\nThis case came before a single justice of the Supreme Court upon the emergency petition of Ronald and Sandra Lapierre (La-pierres) to stay the hearing on their petition to adopt Justin.\nPreviously, on April 30, 1998, this Court entered an order directing the Family Court trial justice to conduct a hearing on the Lapierres\u2019 petition to adopt Justin. The hearing was to take place within thirty days of the entry of the order. The hearing commenced on May 26, 1998, at which time the trial justice announced her intentions to hear both the Lapierre\u2019s petition and the petition of Christine Thompson (Ms. Thompson), who also seeks to adopt Justin, during the course of the same proceeding. Furthermore, Ms. Thompson\u2019s counsel was allowed to participate in the proceeding as an adversary to the Lapierres. The Lapierres filed a motion for stay of the proceedings with respect to the issue of Ms. Thompson\u2019s petition.\nAccordingly we issue the following order and hereby direct the following:\n(1) The tidal justice is to take testimony relative to and consider the petition of the Lapierres only. Ms. Thompson\u2019s petition is not to be heard in conjunction with the Lapierres\u2019 petition. This hearing is not to be conducted as an adversarial proceeding nor is Ms. Thompson to be considered a party. Counsel for Ms. Thompson may not conduct cross-examination of the La-pierres or any witness presented on their behalf.\n(2) The trial justice, in her discretion, may take into consideration all relevant' evidence including such evidence as the Court may deem appropriate from Ms. Thompson, or any other person, which in the Court\u2019s sound discretion may assist the trial justice in deciding the Lapierre\u2019s petition. If Ms. Thompson is called as a witness or is permitted to present other testimony relative to the best interest of the child, counsel for Ms. Thompson may conduct the direct examination of those witnesses.\n(3)Following hearing and decision on such petition, the record shall be returned to this Court forthwith.\nLEDERBERG and FLANDERS, JJ., dissent from the Court\u2019s denial of Ms. Thompson\u2019s status as a party to the proceedings and the denial of cross-examination by Ms. Thompson\u2019s counsel.",
