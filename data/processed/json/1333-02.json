The record discloses that evidence presented on behalf of the state was reasonably satisfactory in establishing that the defendant had violated his probation by committing an assault upon Lisa Martineau.\nConsequently, the defendant\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed. The finding of violation is affirmed.",
