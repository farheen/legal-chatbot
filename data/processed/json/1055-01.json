        "text": "REID, Associate Judge:\nAppellants, Fort Lincoln Civic Association, Inc. (\u201cthe Civic Association\u201d) and Nora Faison, Lillie Mae Griffin, Carol Hood-Mainor, and Harry D. Morgan (collectively \u201cappellants\u201d), appeal the trial court\u2019s dismissal of their breach of contract and non-breach of contract claims against appellees, Fort Lincoln New Town Corporation, Inc. (\u201cNew Town\u201d), Fort Lincoln Realty Corp., Inc. (\u201cthe Realty Corp.\u201d), Michele V. Hagans, and Barbara A. Jones (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d). The trial court dismissed appellants\u2019 breach of contract claims against appellees after concluding that appellants were incidental beneficiaries of a contract entered into by a District of Columbia government agency, then known as the Redevelopment Land Agency (\u201cthe RLA\u201d) and New Town. Subsequently, the trial court dismissed appellants\u2019 remaining claims after granting ap-pellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the appellants\u2019 non-contract claims were not separate and distinct claims from their breach of contract claim, and that appellants did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that any specific duties were owed to them by appellees.\nWe hold that the trial court properly dismissed the appellants\u2019 breach of contract claims because the Civic Association and its members are only incidental beneficiaries of the Land Disposition Agreement (\u201cLDA\u201d). We also conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on appellants\u2019 tort and equitable claims. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to all of these claims. However, we conclude that summary judgment in favor of appellees on appellants\u2019 statutory claims was improper, and hence, we remand the statutory claims to the trial court for further proceedings.\nFACTUAL SUMMARY\nThe record reveals that on June 13, 1975, Fort Lincoln New Town Corporation (\u201cNew Town\u201d), the \u201cRedeveloper,\u201d and an agency of the District of Columbia, then known as the Redevelopment Land Agency (\u201cthe RLA\u201d), entered into a contract, the Land Disposition Agreement (\u201cthe LDA\u201d or \u201cthe Agreement\u201d). Under the LDA, the RLA \u201cagree[d] to sell and/or to lease as lessor, and the Redeveloper [] agreefd] to purchase and or to lease as lessee,\u201d certain \u201cPrivate Development Property,\u201d located in the \u201cFort Lincoln Urban Renewal Area,\u201d in the Northeast quadrant of the District of Columbia. The Urban Renewal Plan for the Fort Lincoln Urban Renewal Area (\u201cthe Urban Renewal Plan\u201d) called for \u201cthe creation of an attractive and racially, socially, economically, and functionally inclusive community of approximately 16,000 persons.\u201d The stated \u201cgeneral development objectives\u201d focused on a \u201cmultifunctional Town Center\u201d; community facilities; secondary and higher education institutions; public parks and recreational facilities; and housing, including \u201cconstruction of approximately 4,600 Dwelling Units with a wide variety of housing types, densities and bedroom sizes for Low Income, Moderate Income, and Middle Income families and individuals, including the elderly.\u201d The LDA, \u00a7 l(j), defined \u201cDwelling Unit\u201d as \u201cone or more habitable rooms forming a single household unit with kitchen and bathroom facilities exclusively for the use of, and under the control of, the occupants thereof.\u201d\nArticle III, \u00a7 3.1 of the LDA contained restrictions on the use of the Private Development Property. Section 3.2 set forth various covenants binding on successors in interest to New Town, and placed enforcement rights and remedies in the RLA, the District of Columbia, \u201cany successor in interest to the Private Development Property,\u201d and the United States. Section 3.3 of Article III specified that the RLA and the United States were deemed the beneficiaries of the agreements and covenants provided for in \u00a7 3.1, \u201cboth for and in their own right and also for the purpose of protecting the interests of the community and the other parties, public or private, in whose favor or for whose benefit such agreements and covenants have been provided.\u201d Section 3.3 further lodged the right to bring judicial enforcement action in the RLA and the United States. Section 3.4 stated that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including but not limited to, provisions in favor of the United States in Section 3.3), no person other than a party to the Agreement or a successor or assign, shall have any right to enforce the terms of the Agreement against a party, its successors or assigns.\u201d\nArticle VII concerned \u201cEqual Employment Opportunities], Social and Economic Programs,\u201d and contained prohibitions on discrimination (\u00a7 7.2), as well as a requirement that the Redeveloper \u201cprovide opportunities for minority firms as contractors, subcontractors and suppliers\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 7.4 and 7.5). Section 7.5(b) called for the \u201ccreation of a real estate company, 25% of whose ownership would rest in a non-profit corporation\u201d; and \u00a7 7.5(c) imposed obligations on the Redeveloper relating to investment in the Town Center. Section 7.8 pertained to \u201cCommunity Organization,\u201d and subsection (a) required the Redevelop-er within three months of the execution of the LDA to create a non-profit corporation \u201cwhich will attempt to secure funds from foundations and from governmental entities and to perform selected community services for the Project during the period of the Plan....\u201d Section 7.7 obligated the Redeveloper to \u201cprovide [an] opportunity for investment by members of the District of Columbia community, particularly minority group members, in the Re-developer,\u201d in part, by \u201cmakfing] available for purchase by members of the local community such number of shares ... as shall constitute 15% of the authorized common stock of the Redeveloper immediately after the issuance thereof....\u201d\nAt the time the LDA was executed, New Town was owned and operated by Theodore R. Hagans, an African American businessman. New Town was incorporated by Mr. Hagans on March 17, 1975, to develop the Fort Lincoln Urban Renewal Area. The Realty Corp. was incorporated by Mr. Hagans on August 18,1975, to manage the sale, rental, management, and maintenance of improvements owned and held for sale or lease by New Town. Mr. Hagans died in a plane crash, in 1984. Appellee, Michele Hagans, is the daughter of Mr. Ha-gans and has been the President and Treasurer of New Town and the Realty Corp. since April 1984. Appellee, Barbara Jones, inherited 33.33% of the stock in New Town and the same amount of the stock in the Realty Corp. Prior to the end of the probate of Mr. Hagans\u2019 estate, Ms. Jones sold her prospective right to the stock of the Realty Corp. to Ms. Hagans. Hence, majority control of New Town and the Realty Corporation always has been in the hands of minority investors.\nOn August 8, 2002, the Civic Association and Ms. Faison, filed a complaint against New Town, the Realty Corp., Ms. Hagans, and Ms. Jones for breach of contract, breach of trust, conversion/misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty/fraud-nondisclosure, and violations of the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\u201cthe CPPA\u201d) and the District of Columbia Condominium Act (\u201cthe Condominium Act\u201d). In the alternative, the Civic Association pleaded negligence and unjust enrichment, and asked the court to impose a constructive trust. On March 13, 2003, Lillie Mae Griffin, Carol Hood-Mai-nor, and Harry D. Morgan filed a class action complaint against appellees alleging the same conduct and identical claims. On August 28, 2003, the trial court consolidated the cases.\nIn an order dated February 17, 2004, the Honorable Michael L. Rankin granted, in part, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, pursuant to Super. Ct. Civ. Rule 12(b)(6). After hearing oral arguments on the issue and reviewing supplemental briefs filed by the parties regarding the test for determining whether a third-party claimant may enforce a government contract, Judge Rankin concluded that \u201cplaintiffs are incidental beneficiaries of the LDA,\u201d and thus, are precluded from enforcing the government contract. In addition, Judge Rankin determined that plaintiffs \u201care specifically precluded by operation of section 3.4 of the LDA from bringing a contract action to enforce the terms of the LDA.\u201d The judge declined, however, to dismiss appellees\u2019 non-contract claims, stating that \u201cwhere a plaintiff alleges a distinct claim, she may proceed on that claim even though another claim arising from the conduct is barred.\u201d\nSubsequently, following discovery and the filing of dispositive motions, the Honorable Herbert B. Dixon, Jr., in essence, reaffirmed Judge Rankin\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim. In addition, he dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims on July 29, 2005, granting the motion of New Town, the Realty Corp., and Ms. Hagans for judgment on the pleadings (treated as a motion for summary judgment), and the motion of Ms. Jones for summary judgment. The judge concluded that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 claims are mere re-characterizations of the previously dismissed breach of contract claim, and that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue the remaining common law and statutory claims alleged in the complaint.\u201d Judge Dixon explained that \u201cJudge Rankin did not rule on the issue of whether plaintiffs\u2019 non-contract claims were simply a re-characterization of plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract allegations.\u201d The judge found that \u201cplaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that their multiple claims are independent of the dismissed breach of contract claim.\u201d In addition, Judge Dixon determined that plaintiffs did not offer sufficient evidence to support their statutory claims and failed to establish that defendants owed them any duties outside of the contract.\nANALYSIS\nThe Contract Claims\nAppellants primarily contend, in essence, that the trial court improperly dismissed their breach of contract claim since they are intended third party beneficiaries who have the right to enforce the terms of the LDA. They claim intended beneficiary status because they are \u201cresidents of Fort Lincoln\u201d (and minority residents), and because \u201cthe express provisions in Article VII [of the LDA] evince a clear intent by the parties to benefit plaintiffs and other residents of Fort Lincoln.\u201d They maintain that appellees failed to implement several provisions of the LDA designed to benefit them. They assert, for example, that New Town (a) \u201cfailed to offer members of the local minority community the opportunity to purchase 15 percent of the common stock of New Town [ ], in violation of Section 7.7(a) [of the LDA]\u201d; (b) \u201cfailed to create a Non-Profit Corporation which would perform community services for the Fort Lincoln area during the redevelopment project, in violation of Section 7.8(a) [of the LDA]\u201d; and (c) \u201cfailed to \u2018provide an opportunity to minority group members to acquire at least 25% of the ownership interest in the free standing retail and personal service shopping space in the Town Center,\u2019 in violation of Section 7.5(c) [of the LDA].\u201d Furthermore, they argue that \u00a7 3.4 of the LDA is limited to the provisions of Article III, and is not applicable to Article VII. Appellants assert that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the formation of the LDA further demonstrate that [they] are intended beneficiaries of the contract.\u201d They point to a statement by Mr. Hagans, \u201cthe soon-to-be President of New Town[],\u201d indicating that \u201c[a]ll members of the Board of [New Town] have a copy of the [LDA],\u201d and that they were \u201cfamiliar with the provisions of the document, particularly Article VII, which relates to the responsibility of the developer to provide opportunities for the minority community to benefit from the development of Fort Lincoln.\u201d They also cite a statement by the then executive director of the RLA concerning the creation of \u201ca non-profit Community Corporation\u201d which would be \u201ccontrolled ... by Fort Lincoln residents,\u201d within two years of the completion of the Project.\nAppellees argue that \u201c[t]he express language\u201d of \u00a7 3.4 of the LDA does not grant to a third party \u201cthe right to bring suit to enforce any of the terms of the LDA[,]\u201d a \u201cgovernment contract.\u201d They insist that \u201c[a]ny rights or benefits conferred upon [appellants] in the LDA do not include the right to sue to enforce any of the terms of the LDA.\u201d Moreover, they maintain, \u201cthe LDA lacks any legislative history, or any appellate construction that can be read as conferring upon [appellants] any right to enforce the terms of the LDA.\u201d Contrary to appellants\u2019 argument, appellees contend that \u00a7 3.4 is not limited to the Article III provisions of the LDA because \u201cSection 3.4 expressly applies to the Agreement and not to some subsections of the Agreement.\u201d Furthermore, appellees assert that appellants are only \u201cincidental beneficiaries\u201d of the LDA.\nWe review denials of motions for judgment as a matter of law de novo. See Cook v. Edgewood Mgmt. Corp., 825 A.2d 939, 945 (D.C.2003). \u201cJudgment as a matter of law may be granted only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party, there is \u2018no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find\u2019 for the non-moving party.\u201d Id. (citing Railan v. Katyal, 766 A.2d 998, 1006 (D.C.2001) (quoting Super. Ct. Civ. R. 50)). \u201cIn our review, we \u2018must take care to avoid weighing the evidence, passing on the credibility of witnesses or substituting [our] judgment for that of the [trial court] or jury.\u2019 \u201d Id. (citing Alliegro v. ACandS Inc., 691 A.2d 102, 105 (D.C. 1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201cA plaintiff cannot \u2018stave off the entry of summary judgment\u2019 through \u2018[m]ere conclusory allegations.\u2019 \u201d Maupin v. Haylock, 931 A.2d 1039, 1042 (D.C.2007) (quoting Musa v. Continental Ins. Co., 644 A.2d 999, 1002 (D.C.1994) (other citation omitted)). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, after which the burden shifts to the non-moving party to designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d La-Prade v. Rosinsky, 882 A.2d 192, 196 (D.C. 2005) (citations omitted). To carry this burden, the non-moving party \u201cmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u201cSince the proper interpretation of a contract is a legal question, \u2018this court exercises de novo review.\u2019 \u201d Unfoldment, Inc. v. District of Columbia Contract Appeals Bd., 909 A.2d 204, 209 (D.C.2006) (quoting Independence Mgmt. Co. v. Anderson & Summers, LLC, 874 A.2d 862, 867 (D.C.2005)). \u201cIn construing a contract, the court must determine what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the disputed language meant.\u201d Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u201cWhere the language in question is unambiguous, its interpretation is a question of law for the court.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u201c \u2018A court must honor the intentions of the parties as reflected in the settled usage of the terms they accepted in the contract ... and will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity\u2019 \u201d Id. (citation omitted).\nWe now discuss whether appellants are intended third-party beneficiaries (of the promises made by the Redeveloper in the LDA) who have the right to enforce the provisions of the Agreement by asserting a breach of contract claim against appellees. Generally, a stranger to a contract may not bring a claim on the contract. German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Home Water Supply Co., 226 U.S. 220, 230, 33 S.Ct. 32, 57 L.Ed. 195 (1912) (\u201cBefore a stranger can avail himself of the exceptional privilege of suing for a breach of an agreement, to which he is not a party, he must, at least show that it was intended for his direct benefit.\u201d). \u201c[A]n indirect interest in the performance of the undertakings\u201d is insufficient. Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn order to sue for damages on a contract claim, a plaintiff must have either direct privity or third party beneficiary status.\u201d Alpine County, California v. United States, 417 F.3d 1366, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing Anderson v. United States, 344 F.3d 1343, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2003)). \u201cThird-party beneficiary status requires that the contracting parties had an express or implied intention to benefit directly the party claiming such status.\u201d Id. The Restatement (SECOND) CONTRACTS (\u201cRESTATEMENT\u201d) uses \u201cthe terms \u2018intended\u2019 beneficiary and \u2018incidental\u2019 beneficiary ... to distinguish beneficiaries who have rights from those who do not.\u201d Restatement, Chapter 14, Introductory Note (1981). Section 302(1) of the Restatement sets forth the circumstances under which an entity or individual will be recognized as an intended beneficiary:\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee, a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and either\n(a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation to pay money to the beneficiary; or\n(b) the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.\nThus, \u201c[a] promise in a contract creates a duty in the promisor to any intended beneficiary to perform the promise, and the intended beneficiary may enforce the duty.\u201d Restatement, \u00a7 304. \u201cAn incidental beneficiary is a person who will be benefited by performance of a promise but who is neither a promisee nor an intended beneficiary.\u201d Restatement, \u00a7 315, cmt. (a); see also Restatement, \u00a7 315 (\u201cAn incidental beneficiary acquires by virtue of the promise no right against the promisor or the promisee.\u201d); Restatement, \u00a7 302(2) (\u201cAn incidental beneficiary is a beneficiary who is not an intended beneficiary.\u201d). In that regard, \u201c[g]overnment contracts often benefit the public, but individual members of the public are treated as incidental beneficiaries unless a different intention is manifested.\u201d Restatement, \u00a7 313 cmt. (a). As the Restatement indicates in \u00a7 313 (2) (a)-(b):\n(2) [A] promisor who contracts with a government or governmental agency to do an act or render a service to the public is not subject to contractual liability to a member of the public for consequential damages resulting from performance or failure to perform unless\n(a) the terms of the promise provide for such liability; or\n(b) the promisee is subject to liability to the member of the public for the damages and a direct action against the promisor is consistent with the terms of the contract and with the policy of the law authorizing the contract and prescribing remedies for its breach.\nWe are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 arguments that express provisions of Article VTI of the LDA substantiate that they, as residents (and minority residents) of Fort Lincoln, are intended beneficiaries of the Agreement, and that statements by Mr. Hagans and the executive director of the RLA during \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the formation of the LDA,\u201d further support their claim as intended beneficiaries. To the contrary, our review of the LDA and the arguments of the parties pertaining to the LDA, convinces us that appellants have not sustained their burden to prove that they are intended beneficiaries, see Ross v. Imperial Constr. Co., Inc., 572 F.2d 518, 520 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cThe burden of proving the requisite intent, of course, falls upon the third party.\u201d). Read as a whole, the LDA manifests an intent to benefit the District of Columbia and all its residents, including minorities and minority business enterprises. Moreover, our reading of the LDA satisfies us that appellants are incidental beneficiaries rather than intended beneficiaries. We start with the premise, as we said in Moore v. Gaither, 767 A.2d 278 (D.C.2001), that \u201c \u2018third party beneficiaries of a Government contract are generally assumed to be merely incidental beneficiaries, and may not enforce the contract absent clear intent to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 287 (quoting Beckett v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, 301 U.S.App.D.C. 380, 388, 995 F.2d 280, 288 (1993) (emphasis in original) (other citation omitted)).\nThat \u201cclear intent,\u201d Moore, 767 A.2d at 287, is not present either in the provisions of the LDA, or in the statements of Mr. Hagans and the executive director of the RLA, which appellants have referenced. The LDA contemplates a range of facilities for the Fort Lincoln community, estimated to consist of 16,000 persons at the time the Agreement was executed. These facilities included community facilities, a commercial Town Center, educational institutions, and housing for low, moderate, and middle income families, and the elderly. The LDA does not single out any particular civic association, nor condominium owners as intended beneficiaries. Nor does it reflect an \u201cexpress or implied intention to benefit ... appellants directly.\u201d See Alpine County, California, 417 F.3d at 1368. See also Chancellor Manor v. United States, 331 F.3d 891, 901 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201c[I]n order to prove third-party beneficiary status, [ajppellants must demonstrate that the contract not only reflects an express or implied intention to benefit the party, but that it reflects an intent to benefit the party directly\u201d) (citing Castle v. United States, 301 F.3d 1328, 1338 (Fed. Cir.2002)). Article VII of the LDA, on which appellants rely to show that they are intended beneficiaries, is designed to ensure equal opportunities for minorities and to preclude discrimination. Appellants\u2019 case for intended beneficiary status centers primarily on \u00a7\u00a7 7.5(b) and \u00a7\u00a7 7.8(a) and (b). Under the introductory paragraph to this section, \u201c[t]he Redeveloper agrees that it will promote, in cooperation with the [RLA], the District of Columbia government, and Federal and other public and private agencies and organizations, to the fullest extent consistent with sound economic development, opportunities for minority owned and operated businesses in the Town Center and Community Malls.\u201d Thus, \u00a7\u00a7 7.5 is earmarked for minority business enterprises. The Complaints, filed in 2002 and 2003, do not identify any of the plaintiffs as owning a minority business enterprise. Nevertheless, appellants appear to suggest that because \u00a7 7.5(b) indicates that \u201cthe Redeveloper will create or cause the creation of a new real estate sales and management company\u201d to handle \u201cthe sale, rental, management and maintenance ... of all Private Improvements owned or held for sale or lease by the Redeveloper,\u201d they are intended beneficiaries of the LDA, as evidenced also by \u00a7 7.5(b)(i) which specifies that \u201cat least 25% of the ownership of the Real Estate Company shall be vested in the Non-Profit Corporation described in [\u00a7 ] 7.8.... \u201d\nBut, nothing in \u00a7 7.8(a) pertaining to the creation of a Non-Profit Corporation whose function was to \u201cattempt to secure funds from foundations and from governmental entities and to perform selected community services for the Project,\u201d that, is the entire Fort Lincoln Urban Renewal Plan, reflects the parties\u2019 intent to make appellants intended beneficiaries with a right to enforce the agreement, as opposed to incidental beneficiaries or members of the community who would derive some benefit from the provisions of the LDA. Similarly, \u00a7 7.8(b) which addresses a homeowners\u2019 association or community corporation, does not catapult appellants into intended beneficiaries. Section 7.8(b) provides for \u201ca study of the alternative methods of ownership and operation of the physical infrastructure of the [Fort Lincoln urban renewal project], including certain community facilities.\u201d The \u201cphysical infrastructure\u201d was not limited to housing such as condominiums with which appellants are primarily associated. More importantly, \u00a7 7.8(b) did not mandate the creation of a homeowners\u2019 association or a community corporation. Rather, \u00a7 7.8(b) left it to the Redeveloper\u2019s discretion as to whether such an association or corporation should be created: \u201cBased upon the results of this study, the Redeveloper shall consider the possibility of establishing a homeowners\u2019 association or community corporation ... for the purpose of owning and operating such facilities.... \u201d\nWhile intent may be \u201cadduced\u201d if it \u201cis not expressly stated in the contract,\u201d see Roedler v. Department of Energy, 255 F.3d 1347, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2001), we cannot discern such an intent from the statements of Mr. Hagans, and the RLA executive director, referenced by appellants. Mr. Hagans\u2019 general statement that members of the New Town Board had a copy of the LDA and were familiar with \u201cArticle VII, which relates to'the responsibility of the developer to provide opportunities for the minority community to benefit from the development of Fort Lincoln,\u201d hardly shows the intent of New Town and the RLA to make the appellants intended beneficiaries of the LDA, and to benefit them directly. Similarly, the general statement by RLA\u2019s executive director about the establishment of \u201ca non-profit Community Corporation\u201d which would be \u201ccontrolled ... by Fort Lincoln residents,\u201d within two years of the completion of the Project, cannot be considered as expression of Mr. Hagans\u2019 and RLA\u2019s intent to make these appellants, associated with condo unit ownership, intended beneficiaries of the LDA, as opposed to incidental beneficiaries.\nIn short, we do not read the LDA as conveying a promise by the Redeveloper, specifically earmarked for the Civic Association or the individual appellees here, to perform any specific duty for these particular appellants or residents of Fort Lincoln. See Restatement, \u00a7 304. Even though appellants might benefit from some of the promises made by the Redeveloper, those promises would not then make them intended beneficiaries. Rather, appellees are incidental beneficiaries, part of the public and the 16,000 residents of the Fort Lincoln community who might realize some benefit from implementation of the LDA. See Restatement, \u00a7 315 cmt. (a). Furthermore, as appellees emphasize, the LDA is a government contract. And, \u201ca promisor who contracts with a ... governmental agency to do an act or render a service to the public is not subject to contractual liability to a member of the public [or a member of the 16,000 person Fort Lincoln community] for consequential damages resulting from [any] ... failure to perform ...\u201d any promise reflected in the LDA. See Restatement, \u00a7 313(2).\nEven assuming, arguendo, that appellants are intended beneficiaries of the LDA, we cannot say that they have a right to enforce this government contract between a District of Columbia agency, and the Redeveloper, and a contract in which the United States has a clear interest, through HUD and through provisions within the LDA. Appellees highlight Article III of the LDA, especially \u00a7 3.3 which not only places the right to bring judicial enforcement action in the RLA and the Redeveloper, but also gives the RLA and the United States the task of \u201cprotecting the interests of the community and the other parties, public or private, in whose favor or for whose benefit [ ] agreements and covenants have been provided.\u201d They further emphasize \u00a7 3.4 which explicitly states that \u201cno person other than a party to the Agreement or a successor or assign, shall have any right to enforce the terms of this Agreement against a party, its successors or assigns.\u201d But appellants argue that the Article III provisions are limited to Article III, and do not preclude them from bringing this enforcement action. Article III of the LDA covers \u201crestrictions upon use of property,\u201d and therefore it is possible to interpret that Article as pertaining only to agreements and covenants related to or running with the land, and not to the entire LDA. Yet, the trial court concluded that by its plain words, particularly the explicit use of the term \u201cthis Agreement,\u201d meaning the entire LDA, \u00a7 3.4 shows that the contracting parties intended for the Article III enforcement provisions to apply to the entire LDA, and to prohibit the action brought by appellants.\nTo examine the arguments of the parties regarding the right to enforce the LDA, we turn to case law from the United States Claims Court or the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In 1984, the Claims Court articulated a two-part test to determine whether a contract \u201centitle[d] one to sue as a third-party beneficiary of a contract which he is not a party\u201d: \u201c[T]he contract must reflect the intent not merely to benefit the third-party but also to give him the direct right to compensation or to enforce that right against the promisor.\u201d Baudier Marine Elecs., Sales & Serv., Inc. v. United States, 6 Cl.Ct. 246, 249 (1984) (citations omitted). Ultimately, the Baudier test was rejected by Schuerman v. United States, 30 Fed.Cl. 420, 428-33 (1994), and replaced by one adopted in Montana v. United States, 124 F.3d 1269, 1273 (Fed.Cir.1997). See Flexfab, LLC v. United States, 62 Fed.Cl. 139, 147 (2004). Thus, \u201cthe appropriate test for intended third-party beneficiary status includes only the first prong of the Baudier test, that the contract must \u2018reflect[ ] the express or implied intention of the parties to benefit the third party.\u2019 \u201d Montana, supra, 124 F.3d at 1273 (quoting Schuerman, 30 Fed. Cl. at 433). Montana further declared that \u201c[o]ne way to ascertain such intent is to ask whether the beneficiary would be reasonable in relying on the promise as manifesting an intention to confer a right on him.\u201d Id. at 1273 & n. 7 (citing ReSTATEMENT (SECOND) OP CONTRACTS \u00a7 302(l)(b) cmt. (d)). Under this refined test concerning intended beneficiary status, our inquiry is whether appellants would be reasonable \u201cin relying on the promise[s] [of the LDA parties] as manifesting an intention to convey a right on them,\u201d specifically, the right to sue to enforce the contract. Dewakuku v. Martinez, 271 F.3d 1031, 1042 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citing U.S. Ecology, Inc. v. United States, 245 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed.Cir.2001); Montana, supra, 124 F.3d at 1273).\nBy focusing on Articles III and X in particular, we examine whether appellants here would be reasonable in relying on the LDA parties\u2019 promises as manifesting an intention to confer on appellants the right to sue to enforce the LDA contract. We set forth pertinent provisions of Article III earlier in this opinion, but Article. X governing remedies also is instructive concerning the right to enforce the LDA. Section 10.1(a) generally provides an enforcement process limited to the RLA and the Redeveloper. In the case of a default and a failure to cure, \u201can aggrieved party may, in addition to exercising any other rights specified in this Agreement, institute such proceedings as may be necessary or desirable in its opinion to cure and remedy such default or breach, including, but not limited to, proceedings to compel specific performance of its obligations by the party in default or breach where not inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement.\u201d Section 10.4 addresses \u201cdefaults by the Redeveloper with respect to this Agreement\u201d and alleged defaults, including those relating to Article VII, \u00a7\u00a7 7.5(b) (opportunities for minority business enterprises, and the creation of the Real Estate Company) and 7.8 (creation and funding of the Non-Profit Corporation or the Homeowners\u2019 Association). In the event of a failure of the Redeveloper to cure any alleged default in response to a written demand by the RLA, \u201cthe Agency at its option may terminate the Agreement,\u201d but the Redeveloper may elect to continue to develop \u201cParcels previously conveyed to [it].\u201d And, the Agency and the Redeveloper would retain the right \u201cto the benefits of, and to enforce, all rights, obligations, conditions, covenants and other provisions of the Agreement relating to or affecting the development of all Parcels which have been conveyed to the Redevel-oper or with respect to which the Redevel-oper has made the election to continue....\u201d Although Article X apparently does not include language identical to that appearing in \u00a7 3.4 which explicitly states that \u201cno person other than a party to the Agreement ... shall have any right to enforce the terms of the Agreement against a party ...,\u201d it contains no provision which suggests, even remotely, that the parties intended any third party to have the right to enforce the LDA. Nor do we see any implicit provision in the LDA which reasonably may be interpreted to reflect an intent on the part of the RLA and the Redeveloper to permit appellants such as those involved here to bring an action to enforce the LDA.\nIn light of the explicit language of \u00a7 3.4 (\u201cno person other than a party to this Agreement, or a successor or assign, shall have any right to enforce the terms of this Agreement against a party, its successors or assigns\u201d), and the lack of any express language in Article X on remedies which grants a third-party a right to file an enforcement action against the contracting parties, we conclude that appellants could not reasonably rely on the LDA as conveying the parties\u2019 intent to confer on them the right to file such an action. See U.S. Ecology, supra, 245 F.3d at 1357 (\u201cIf the federal government [or District government] had intended for the alleged contract to confer a right upon a third party, it could have expressly provided for such a right in the contract documents.\u201d); see also Dewakuku, supra, 271 F.3d at 1041-42 (explicit language in one section of the contract \u2014 \u201c[n]o third party contract rights conferred \u2014 ... extinguished] the rights of any third party under the [contract],\u201d precluded an enforcement action by a third-party, despite contention that \u201cwhen read within the broad context of the [contract], [that section] is anything but clear\u201d). In short, we are persuaded that appellants do not enjoy intended beneficiary status under the LDA, but are properly described as incidental beneficiaries. And, appellants could not reasonably rely on any promise made by the parties to the LDA as conveying on them the right to bring an action to enforce the LDA.\nAppellants\u2019 Other Non-statutory Claims\nWe now review the arguments pertaining to appellants\u2019 remaining non-statutory claims, which we can deal with summarily. Judge Rankin did not dismiss these claims since discovery had not been completed at the time of his decision. After discovery had been completed, Judge Dixon reviewed the evidence presented by the parties in support of and in opposition to the motions for summary judgment before granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The trial court determined that (1) \u201cplaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that their multiple claims are independent of the dismissed breach of contract claim\u201d; (2) these claims \u201csimply rely on alleged violations of the LDA, a contract\u201d; (3) \u201cplaintiffs have not established that the defendants owe any duty outside of a contract action based on the LDA\u201d; and (4) \u201c[p]laintiffs\u2019 remaining common law ... claims are an impermissible re-characterization of the breach of contract claim.\u201d\nAppellants contend that the trial court\u2019s ruling is incorrect. They argue that they have tort and equitable claims based on \u201ccommon-law duties, not contractual obligations.\u201d Appellees argue that \u201c[w]hile the [non-contract] claims may be based on the same conduct [as the breach of contract claim], the claims must be separate and distinct and supported by facts that support the separate and distinct claims.\u201d But, appellees maintain, \u201c[appellants] [] only presented facts that are consistent with an alleged breach of the LDA by [appellees].\u201d Further, they insist, appellants \u201cdid not present any evidence of a breach of duty owed to Plaintiffs by Defendants that is separate and distinct from the breach of contract claim that was dismissed by the trial court.\u201d\nCases in this court discussing separate claims or causes of action for assault and battery, and for negligence, \u201cdo not preclude separate causes of action where the plaintiff has pled and established separate and distinct claims.\u201d District of Columbia v. Chinn, 839 A.2d 701, 710 (D.C.2003). As we noted in Chinn, in a previous case, \u201cwe held that the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury on [separate] counts, but we made clear that the two claims were separate and distinct, even though \u2018related,\u2019 and that the two counts were supported by different evidence.\u201d Id. (citing District of Columbia v. Tinker, 691 A.2d 57, 63 n. 5 (D.C.1997)) (discussing Etheredge v. District of Columbia, 635 A.2d 908 (D.C.1993)). Where an \u201cappellant has ... merely recharacterizefd] her assault claim as one grounded in negligence,\u201d however, evidence is not sufficient to go to the jury on separate counts.\nHere, the record shows that appellants\u2019 breach of trust (count 2), conversion/misappropriation (count 3), breach of fiduciary duty/fraud/non-disclosure (count 4), and negligence (alternative count 7) claims all are based on Article VII of the LDA, and specifically \u00a7\u00a7 7.5(b) and 7.8, as was their breach of contract claim. In addition, the negligence claim is dependent upon the breach of fiduciary duty claim. Moreover, the exhibits cited as evidence in support of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment are substantially the same as those supporting the breach of contract claim, and the primary exhibit for all of these counts is Exhibit 1, the LDA. Under these circumstances and applying the principles enunciated in Chinn, supra, these non-statutory claims are not \u201cseparate and distinct claims\u201d \u201csupported by different evidence,\u201d 839 A.2d at 710. Hence, we agree with the trial court that these \u201cclaims are an impermissible re-characterization of the breach of contract claim.\u201d See Reaves-Bey, supra note 13, 840 A.2d at 704.\nAppellants\u2019 Statutory Claims\nThe trial court declared that \u201cas to the statutory claims, plaintiffs have failed to proffer sufficient evidence to support these causes of action,\u201d and that their \u201cstatutory claims are an impermissible re-characterization of the breach of contract claim.\u201d Appellants contend that this ruling is incorrect. They argue that \u201cthey have claims as consumers and condominium purchasers under District of Columbia law.\u201d\nFor their CPPA claim, appellants alleged a violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 28 \u2014 3904(e) and (f) (2001), relating to \u201cunfair trade practices.\u201d Paragraphs 80 through 82 of Count 5 of appellants\u2019 complaint stated, in pertinent part:\n80.Since Defendants began selling condominiums in Fort Lincoln and up to the present, defendants have failed to disclose in their Public Offering Statements any of their obligations under Article VII of the Land Disposition Agreement, including, inter alia, their obligation to establish and fund the Non-Profit Corporation which would be controlled by, and provide services for, the benefit of Fort Lincoln residents, their obligations to convey 25 percent ownership in defendant Realty Corporation so that the residents would have control over and profit from the sale and lease of properties in Fort Lincoln, and the Non-Profit Corporation\u2019s entitlement to a substantial percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale and lease of properties in Fort Lincoln by third parties. Instead, the Public Offering Statements indicated that it was the responsibility of the residents to form and fund a community or homeowners\u2019 organization, if they desired one. Defendants intentionally concealed their obligations under Article VII and intentionally misled the Fort Lincoln residents into believing it was their responsibility to establish and fund a community or homeowners\u2019 association.\n81. Defendants\u2019 obligations under Article VII of the Land Disposition Agreement constitute material information that any prospective owner or tenant would want to know.\n82. Defendants misrepresented material facts and failed to state material facts which had a tendency to mislead in violation of the Consumer Protection Procedures Act.\nAs for the Condominium Act, appellants\u2019 complaint alleged a violation of what is now codified as D.C.Code \u00a7 42-1904.04(a) (2001). Paragraph 88 of appellants\u2019 Complaint (relating to the alleged Condominium Act violation) was identical to Paragraph 80 pertaining to the alleged CPPA violation. Paragraphs 86 and 87 of the Complaint declared that \u201cDefendants\u2019 obligations under Article VII of the [LDA] constitute \u2018unusual and material circumstances or features\u2019 affecting the condominiums at Fort Lincoln\u201d; and that the LDA \u201cis a \u2018contract or agreement substantially affecting the use or maintenance of the condominiums at Fort Lincoln.\u2019 \u201d\nAppellees contend that appellants\u2019 CPPA claims were properly dismissed because appellants have not alleged that the information that appellees failed to disclose \u201cwas considered to be material or misleading to any decision made by any of the Plaintiffs.\u201d Yet, paragraph 80 of appellants\u2019 CPPA count alleges that appellees \u201cmisled, Fort Lincoln residents into believing that it was their responsibility to establish and fund a community or homeowners\u2019 organization\u201d (italics added). Although appellants\u2019 pleadings may not have used the word material, the claim that the information that appellees failed to disclose was material is unmistakably the theme of the Supplemental Affidavit of appellant Nora Faison, who states that if she had known about appellees\u2019 obligations under the LDA, she \u201cwould have tried to get the District of Columbia to enforce these obligations,\u201d that she would have felt that she and \u201call Fort Lincoln residents [ ] had leverage with [appellees] to make improvements in the Fort Lincoln community,\u201d such as improvements that Faison sought with respect to duct work in her condominium and improvements that residents have sought to improve security in the community; and that condominium owners could have avoided the expense they incurred, through their condominium fees, to build a fence around the site of a Civil War-era cannon located in Fort Lincoln to protect it from vandalism, because the Non-Profit Corporation that appellees had a contractual obligation to create and fund \u2014 and on whose Board Fort Lincoln residents would have sat \u2014 could have been asked to bear that expense.\nAppellees argue that appellants\u2019 Condominium Act claim was properly dismissed because that Act \u2014 specifically, D.C.Code \u00a7 42-1904.17 \u2014 gives the Attorney General of the District of Columbia exclusive authority to prosecute willful violations of the Act. Appellees\u2019 argument fails to address D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 42-1902.09 and -1904.02(d). Section 42-1902.09 states that \u201c[a]ny lack of compliance with this chapter ... shall be grounds for an action or suit to recover damages or injunctive relief, or for any other available remedy maintainable by the unit owners\u2019 association, the unit owners\u2019 association\u2019s executive board, any managing agent on behalf of the unit owners\u2019 association, an aggrieved person on his or her own behalf, or, in an otherwise proper case, as a class action.\u201d Section 1904.02(d) states in pertinent part that \u201c[a] declarant [offering a condominium unit for sale] shall be liable under this chapter for any false or misleading statement in a public offering statement or for any omission of a material fact with respect to the portion of the public offering statement that he or she prepared or caused to be prepared.\u201d These provisions clearly provide for a private cause of action by aggrieved condominium owners or owners\u2019 associations against persons who have sold condominiums without complying with the Act by providing, in their condominium public offering statements, the information about \u201call unusual and material circumstances or features affecting the condominium\u201d required by D.C.Code \u00a7 42-1904.04(a).\nNeither \u00a7\u00a7 28-3904(e)-(f) or - 3905(k)(l) of the CPPA, nor \u00a7\u00a7 42-1904.02(d) and -1902.09 of the Condominium Act, state that, to be actionable, an alleged misleading statement or omission must be willful or intentional. In Caulfield v. Stark, 893 A.2d 970 (D.C.2006), we observed that \u201cunintentional misrepresentation under the CPPA is still an open question\u201d; we did not decide the issue but \u201cassumed ... (without deciding) that unintentional misrepresentation claims are available under the CPPA.\u201d Id. at 977. In deciding the issue here, we take into account the requirement that we construe and apply the CPPA \u201cliberally to promote its purpose.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28-3901(c). We also note that, in enacting some paragraphs of \u00a7 28-3904 other than paragraphs (e) and (f) with which we are concerned, the Council of the District of Columbia specified that, to violate the statute, the acts described must be done with deceit or with knowledge of the probable adverse impact on the consumer. See, e.g., D.C.Code \u00a7 28-3904(r)(l)-(5), and (t). By contrast, \u00a7 28-3904(e) and (f) describe simple \u201cmisrepresentation] as to a material fact which has a tendency to mislead\u201d and \u201cfail[ure] to state a material fact if such failure tends to mislead.\u201d In light of the plain language of these sections, the ordinary meaning of the words used, and all of the foregoing considerations, we now hold that a condominium owner or condominium owners\u2019 association need not allege or prove intentional misrepresentation or failure to disclose to prevail on a claimed violation of \u00a7 28-3904(e) or (f) of the CPPA. See The Chelsea Condo. Unit Owners Ass\u2019n v. 1815 A St. Condo. Group, LLC, 468 F.Supp.2d 136, 142 n. 6 (D.D.C.2007) (distinguishing plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claims from their CPPA claims).\nSimilarly, under D.C.Code \u00a7 42-1904.04(a), consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used, a plaintiff may merely prove a failure to disclose material information. Once this is done, liability attaches and the plaintiff must prove damages. However, a plaintiff may also state a claim for common law fraud. In 313 Freemason v. Freemason Assocs., 59 Va. Cir. 407 (Va. Cir. Ct.2002), a Virginia trial court reasoned that Virginia\u2019s condominium disclosure statute, Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-79.90, \u201cmay have a basis in fraud,\u201d and therefore permitted plaintiffs association to sue officers of the condominium developer as well as the developer itself, since the individuals would be reachable in a suit for a common law tort. 59 Va. Cir. at 410. However, the court also observed that a violation of the statute \u201cmay take the form of fraudulent, and therefore tortious, conduct,\u201d id. (italics added), suggesting that \u00a7 55-79.90 permits but does not require the plaintiff to allege the elements of common law fraud. Thus, we conclude that a plaintiff condominium owner or owners\u2019 association that files a claim relating to the public offering statement under \u00a7 42-1904.04(a) may allege either mere failure of the developer to disclose in its public offering statement a material and unusual feature affecting the condominium or an intentional or fraudulent failure to disclose in its public offering statement a material and unusual feature affecting the condominium.\nIn both the CPPA and Condominium Act counts of their complaint, appellants alleged that appellees are liable for punitive damages because \u201ctheir conduct was willful, malicious and done in an intentional or reckless disregard for the known rights\u201d of appellants. Complaint, paragraphs 84 and 94. However, in both counts, appellants also alleged simple failure to disclose and misleading statements. In paragraph 2 of their Complaint, appellants alleged that appellees \u201cconcealed the existence [their obligations under the LDA] from the residents.\u201d Paragraphs 80 and 88 both assert that since appellees began selling condominiums in Fort Lincoln, they\nhave failed to disclose in their Public Offering Statements any of the obligations under Article VII of the Land Disposition Agreement, including, inter alia, their obligation to establish and fund the Non-profit Corporation which would be controlled by and provide services for the benefit of Fort Lincoln residents, their obligation to convey 25 percent ownership in defendant Realty corporation so that the residents would have control over and profit from the sale and lease of properties in Fort Lincoln, and the Non-Profit Corporation\u2019s entitlement to a substantial percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale and lease of properties in Fort Lincoln by third parties. Instead, the Public Offering Statements indicated that it was the responsibility of the residents to form and fund a community or homeowners\u2019 organization, if they desired one.\nComplaint, paragraphs 80 and 88. There is no dispute that appellees\u2019 public offering statements did not disclose information about the LDA or appellees\u2019 obligations under it. Under the CPPA the issue raised for the jury is whether appellees\u2019 statements about condominium purchasers\u2019 options with respect to a homeowners\u2019 organization and appellees\u2019 failure to disclose the pertinent provisions of the LDA were actually material and tended to mislead. See D.C.Code \u00a7 28-8904(e) and (f). Under the Condominium Act, the issue raised for the jury would be whether the omitted information was both an \u201cunusual and material\u201d circumstance or feature affecting the condominium. Thus, even if, in Judge Dixon\u2019s words, appellants \u201cfailed to proffer sufficient evidence to support\u201d their claims about intentional omissions and intentionally misleading statements, they were entitled to present to a jury their claim that information about the LDA was unusual and material. Hence, we remand the statutory claims to the trial court for further proceedings.\nThe Claims Against Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones\nAppellants contend that the trial court erred in ruling that their unjust enrichment claim against Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones, in their individual capacities, was barred, either \u201cas a re-characterization of the breach of contract claim and for lack of standing\u201d (Ms. Hagans), or due to the statute of limitations applicable to \u201cclaims against the Estate of Theodore T. Hagans, Jr.\u201d (Ms. Jones). Appellants alleged that Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones were unjustly enriched because 25% of the shares of the Realty Corporation were never transferred to the Non-Profit Corporation as required by Article VII of the LDA, and because they retained 100% of the shares of New Town, and Ms. Hagans wrongfully retains \u201c49 percent of the ownership interest in the Realty Corporation that was never transferred to the NonProfit Corporation as required by the LDA\u201d; therefore, a constructive trust should be imposed on those assets. We agree with the trial court that the discovery rule does not apply to the unjust claim against Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones, thereby tolling the statute of limitations. As the trial court found, \u201cthe notice of appointment of a personal representative of the Estate of [Mr. Hagans Jr.] was published in 1984\u201d and claims against the heirs and legatees of his estate had to be \u201cpresented within 6 months after the date of first publication of notice of the appointment of personal representative,\u201d under D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 20 \u2014 903(a)(1); and pursuant to \u00a7 20 \u2014 1303(b)(1), the right of a person to recover assets improperly distributed to a decedent\u2019s heirs \u201cshall be barred one year from the date of distribution of all assets of the estate and satisfaction of all known claims against the estate.\u201d\nThe trial court determined that there had been \u201cnotice through public discussion of the LDA\u201d; and the assets of Mr. Ha-gans\u2019 estate were distributed to his heirs in the early 1990s. The court also concluded that Ms. Hagans did not waive the statute of limitations defense. Therefore the applicable statute of limitations barred the unjust enrichment claims against Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones. The court also \u201cconclude[d] that the [unjust enrichment] claim against [Ms.] Hagans is barred as a re-characterization of the breach of contract claim and for lack of standing....\u201d\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the discovery rule applied to appellants\u2019 unjust enrichment claim, or that Ms. Hagans waived the statute of limitations\u2019 defense, as appellants argue, we agree with the trial court that the unjust enrichment and related constructive trust counts of appellants\u2019 complaint simply re-characterized appellants\u2019 breach of contract claim. \u201cUnjust enrichment occurs when: (1) the plaintiff conferred a benefit on the defendant; (2) the defendant retains the benefit; and (3) under the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s retention of the benefit is unjust.\u201d News World Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Thompson, 878 A.2d 1218, 1222 (D.C.2005) (citation omitted); see also Jordan Keys & Jessamy v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 870 A.2d 58, 63 (D.C.2005) (\u201cUnjust enrichment occurs when a person retains a benefit ... which in justice and equity belongs to another.\u201d). Here, appellants\u2019 theory of unjust enrichment is based on the premise that they are intended beneficiaries of the LDA, and in part on the assumption, as they argued in their motion for partial summary judgment, that \u201c[u]n-der the [LDA], Mr. Hagans, as a member of a minority group, should have held a maximum of 51 percent of the shares of the Realty Corp. and the profits from the remaining 49 percent of the shares should have gone to the Non-Profit Corporation\u201d for appellants\u2019 benefit. This is essentially the same theory behind part of their breach of contract claim.\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court, in part, but remand the statutory claims to the trial court for further proceedings.\nSo ordered.\n. See D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-803 and -804 (1981), recodified at D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-301.03 and 6-301.04 (2001). The RLA no longer exists. Its functions, duties, powers, and assets were transferred to the RLA Revitalization Corporation under D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-1219.31, et seq. (2007).\n. Article I of the Agreement defined the \"Private Development Property\u201d as \"Town Center Parcels of approximately 30 acres, three Community Mall parcels of approximately one acre each, and approximately 143 acres of Residential Parcels ...., all to be developed by the Redeveloper.\u201d The Private Development Property had been transferred from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\u201d) to the RLA on June 5, 1975.\n. Section 310.02, Urban Renewal Plan.\n. Section 310.04(a) through (e), Urban Renewal Plan.\n. Section 3.3 of the LDA stated, in part:\nThe Agency, in the event of any breach of any such agreement or covenant, and the United States, in the event of any breach of any agreement or covenant provided in subsections 3.1(b) [prohibition on discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in the sale, lease, rental, use or occupancy of the Private Development Property], and 3.1(c) [requiring that all advertising of sales or rental indicate that the Private Development Property is \"An Open Occupancy Building\u201d], shall have the right to exercise all of the rights and remedies, and to maintain any actions or suits at law or in equity or other proper proceedings to enforce the curing of such breach of agreement or covenant, to which it or any other beneficiary of such agreement or covenant may be entitled.\n.The relevant parts of \u00a7 7.5(b) mandated that:\nWithin 3 months after the date of this Agreement, the Redeveloper will create or cause the creation of a new real estate sales and management company (the \"Real Estate Company\u201d) with which the Redevelop-er shall contract for the sales, rental, management and maintenance (except to the extent such maintenance is handled by GSA) of all Private Improvements owned or held for sale or lease by the Redevelop-er.... The Real Estate Company may be owned by the Redeveloper or shareholders of the Redeveloper subject to the following:\n(i) At the time of creation of the Real Estate Company at least 25% of the ownership of the Real Estate Company shall be vested in the Non-Profit Corporation described in Section 7.8 or held by the Rede-veloper in trust for the Non-Profit Corporation pending its creation.\n. Section 7.5(c) stated, in pertinent part:\nThe Redeveloper shall afford minority group members equal opportunity to invest in Private Improvements in the Town Center by providing an opportunity to minority group members to acquire at least 25% of the ownership interest in the free standing retail and personal service shopping space in the Town Center (consisting of approximately 50,000 square feet).\n. Section l(y) of the LDA provided that:\n\" 'Project' shall have the meaning set forth in Recital 3 hereof.\u201d Recital 3, the third \"whereas\u201d clause of the LDA, referred to the entire \"urban renewal project known as the Fort Lincoln Urban Renewal Area\u201d as \u201cthe 'Project.' \u201d Section 7.8(b) stated:\nThe Redeveloper has commissioned a study of the alternative methods of ownership and operation of the physical infrastructure of the Project, including community facilities within the Project Property [defined in \u00a7 l(z) as \u201cboth the Private Development Property and the property to be owned by governmental agencies\u201d] which are not to be owned and operated by the government of the District of Columbia. Based upon the results of this study, the Redeveloper shall consider the possibility of establishing a homeowners' association or community corporation (The \"Homeowners\u2019 Association\u201d) for the purpose of owning and operating such facilities and shall determine the manner of funding the activities of such a Homeowners\u2019 Association.\n.The 2002 Complaint identified the Civic Association as a not-for-profit membership organization. Membership was limited to owners or residents of Fort Lincoln. The Civic Association\u2019s Executive Board included the presidents of five condominium associations and five rental associations. Ms. Faison has been a condo owner since 1976.\n. According to the 2003 Complaint, Ms. Griffin has been a condominium owner since 1976 and Ms. Hood-Mainor since 1978. Mr. Morgan was a condominium owner between 1976 and 1988.\n. For example, \u00a7 7.1(b) concerns \"training, employment, business and investment opportunities for minority group members\u201d; \u00a7 7.2(a) prohibits discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u201d; \u00a7 7.3 refers to \"opportunities for training and employment of residents of the District of Columbia, particularly minority group residents, in the planning, construction, management, sales or leasing, and maintenance of Private Improvements [constructed within Parcels conveyed to the Redeveloper] to be developed under [the LDA]\u201d; and \u00a7 7.4 pertains to \"opportunities for minority firms as contractors, subcontractors and suppliers in the construction and development of [private and public improvements].\u201d\n. Schuerman relied upon \u00a7 302 of the Restatement, and limited the court's third-party beneficiaiy test to Baudier\u2019s first prong, the so-called \"intention-to-benefit\u201d test. Flexfab, 62 Fed.Cl. at 147 (citing Schuerman, [30 Fed. Cl.] at 433).\n. Reaves-Bey v. Karr, 840 A.2d 701, 704 (D.C.2004).\n. Appellants maintain that:\n[New Town] violated the [CPPA] by failing to inform condominium buyers of the existence of the LDA and New Town's [] obligations under that Agreement when it offered condominiums for sale. This constituted a failure to state a material fact which tended to mislead. Even if only the parties to the LDA could enforce it, the benefit to Fort Lincoln residents conferred by the LDA was clearly a material fact for prospective residents. The Realty Corp.[] also violated the [CPPA] because it failed to disclose the material provisions of the LDA when it provided management services to the condominium associations and received commissions from condominium sales.\nWith respect to the Condominium Act, appellants assert that:\nNew Town\u2019s [] obligations under the LDA were \"unusual and material circumstances\u201d that substantially affected the use or maintenance of the condominiums. Therefore, under the Condominium Act, [] New Town [] was required to inform the purchasers of units in Condominiums 2-5 about the terms of Article VII and to attach a copy of the LDA to the public offering statements for the condominiums it built in Fort Lincoln and offered for sale.\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 28~3904(e) and (f) (2001) provide:\nIt shall be a violation of this chapter, whether or not any consumer is in fact misled, deceived or damaged thereby, for any person to: ...\n(e) misrepresent as to a material fact which has a tendency to mislead;\n(f) fail to state a material fact if such failure tends to mislead\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 42-1904.04(a)(7) states, in pertinent part:\n(a) A public offering statement shall disclose fully and accurately the characteristics of the condominium and the units therein offered and shall make known to prospective purchasers all unusual and material circumstances or features affecting the condominium. The proposed public offering statement submitted to the Mayor shall be in a form prescribed by his rules and shall include: ...\n(7) A copy of any management contract, lease of recreational areas, and any other contract or agreement substantially affecting the use or maintenance of, or access to all or any part of the condominium with a brief narrative statement of the effect of each such agreement upon a purchaser, the condominium unit owners and the condominium, and a statement of the relationship, if any, between the declarant and the managing agent or firm[.]\n. Faison\u2019s affidavit was filed in support of appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment rather than in opposition to appellees' (subsequent) motions for summary judgment, but should have been taken into account by the trial judge for purposes of determining whether appellants' allegations were sufficient to withstand summary judgment.\n. Section 1904.02(d) provides further that \"[i]f a declarant did not prepare or cause to be prepared any part of a public offering statement that he or she delivers, the declar-ant shall not be liable for any false or misleading statement or any omission of a material fact unless he or she had actual knowledge of the statement or omission or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the statement or omission.\u201d\n. We are aware of no reason why claims under the Condominium Act should be limited to claims about the physical features of a condominium.\n. This is not surprising because State consumer protection statutes were also intended to overcome the pleadings problem associated with common law fraud claims by eliminating the requirement of proving certain elements such as intent to deceive and scienter. See Bob Cohen, Annotation, Right to Private Action Under State Consumer Protection Act\u2014 Equitable Relief Available, 115 A.L.R.5th 709, 726-27 (2004); see also Stuart M. Speiser, Charles F. Krause & Alfred W. Gans, 9 American Law of Torts 628-41 (1992).\n. As we recognized in Caulfield, \"in Osbourne v. Capital City Mortgage Corp., 727 A.2d 322, 326 (D.C. 1999), we held that 'the clear and convincing evidence standard applies to claims of intentional misrepresentation under the CPPA,\u2019 but we did not address whether the CPPA also embraces claims of unintentional misrepresentation.\u201d 893 A.2d at 976; see also Virginia Acad. of Clinical Psychologists v. Group Hospitalization & Med. Servs., 878 A.2d 1226, 1241 (D.C.2005) (citing Osbourne ).\n. \"The essential elements of common law fraud are: (1) a false representation (2) in reference to material fact, (3) made with knowledge of its falsity, (4) with the intent to deceive, and (5) action is taken in reliance upon the representation.\u201d Bennett v. Kiggins, 377 A.2d 57, 59-60 (D.C.1977).\nThe Council of the District of Columbia modeled the District\u2019s Condominium Act on the Virginia Condominium Act. See Council of the District of Columbia, Committee on Housing and Urban Development, Report on Bill 1-179, \"Condominium Act of 1976,\u201d June 16, 1976, Amended June 18, 1976, at 2. The Council Report states, in part:\nTo continue and expand the policy of consumer protection ...., [t]he Act: ...\n\u2014requires a public offering statement for residential condominium offerings giving essential information to prospective purchasers, as well as requiring supplemental information to be made available to the purchaser to ensure full and fair disclosure (Sec 404 \u2014 -Public Offering Statement).\nId. at 4.\n. As appellants note in their Brief, the \"Condominium Act only applies to Condominiums 2 through 5 because they were built after March 29, 1977, [and] Condominium 1 was built prior to the effective date\u201d of the Condominium Act.\n. In Count IV, appellants also alleged fraudulent non-disclosure.\n. See also paragraph 50 (\"Defendant Rede-veloper never even informed the residents about its obligation to form [the Non-profit Corporation]....\u201d)\n. In addition, the Complaint seeks not only-punitive damages for allegedly intentional acts by appellees, but also compensatory damages. Complaint, paragraphs 3, 99(a).\n. Appellees argue that the damages that appellants allege are \"speculative at best\u201d because the injuries that appellants allege were proximately caused not by appellees\u2019 non-disclosure, but by appellees\u2019 alleged failure to satisfy the obligations of the LDA; and because, to avoid the alleged injury, appellants would have had to \"put pressure on [appel-lees] and the District [to] make sure that the terms of the LDA were enforced,\u201d an effort whose results may not have been successful even if appellants had been fully informed about the LDA. We leave these issues, and any others relating to damages, to the trial court on remand. We also note that appellee has not raised on this appeal any question about the applicability of the CPPA to this condominium project. See Owens v. Curtis, 432 A.2d 737 (D.C.1981); D.C.Code \u00a7 29-3901(a)(7) (2001) (as amended).\n.D.C.Code \u00a7 20-903(a)(l) (2001) specifies:\n(a) Requirement of presentation; time; limitation. \u2014 Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute with respect to claims of the United States and the District of Columbia, (1) all claims against a decedent\u2019s estate, whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract or other legal basis, shall be barred against the estate, the personal representative, and the heirs and legatees, unless presented within 6 months after the date of the first publication of notice of the appointment of a personal representative....\nD.C.Code \u00a7 20-1303(b)(l) provides:\n(b)(1) Claims against heirs and legatees.\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in section 20-1302, the right of any person seeking to recover improperly distributed property or its value from any person to whom property has been distributed shall be barred one year from the date of distribution of all the assets of the estate and satisfaction of all known claims against the estate.\n. Ms. Jones maintained during summary judgment that although she had a right to receive shares of the Realty Corp., she in fact never owned any such shares because she sold her right to them as an heir to Ms. Hagans. She also asserted that she never received any dividends, enrichment or benefits from her ownership of shares in New Town.",
