        "text": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nIn the proceeding under review, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d) sought enforcement by the Commonwealth Court of the court\u2019s previous decision sustaining the carrier\u2019s challenge to one aspect of the methodology utilized by the Public Utility Commission (the \u201cPUC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d) in allocating the agency\u2019s regulatory expenses among utilities for assessment purposes as provided by statute. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order pertaining to the enforcement phase of the proceedings.\nAs a national motor carrier of property, certain of UPS\u2019s operations in Pennsylvania are conducted pursuant to Commission authority and subject to its jurisdiction. With the substantial deregulation of the motor carrier industry beginning in 1995, however, the PUC\u2019s regulatory role in relation to such carriers was reduced, see generally Application of S. Penn Gas Co., A-122900F0003, slip op., 1994 WL 932389 (Pa.P.U.C. Jul.26, 1994) (referencing \u201cthe considerable relaxation of motor carrier regulation\u201d), resulting in decreases in at least some of the expenditures by the Commission pertaining to UPS\u2019s regulation.\nPursuant to Section 510(b) of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(b), the PUC is authorized to charge its regulatory expenses to the utilities subject to its jurisdiction. The statute also directs how those expenses are to be allocated among the utilities. As a threshold matter, the Commission segregates its overall expenses into two general components of \u201cdirect expenses\u201d and \u201cindirect expenses,\u201d with direct expenses comprised of expenditures that are specifically attributable to regulation of a given subset of utilities, see 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(b)(1), and indirect expenses representing the balance of the Commission\u2019s regulatory expenses. See 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(b)(2). With respect to direct expenses, the statute requires proportional allocation among groupings of \u201cutilities furnishing the same kind of service.\u201d 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(b)(1). In implementing the statute with respect to all utilities that it assessed during all relevant time periods, the Commission employed twelve groupings of utilities furnishing the same kind of services: Airplanes, Boats & Ferries, Electric, Electric Generators, Gas, Motor Carriers of Property, Motor Common Carriers, Pipelines, Railroad, Steam Heat, Telephone, and Water & Sewer (the \u201cUtility Groups\u201d). Prior to the underlying litigation, UPS was assigned to the \u201cMotor Carriers of Property\u201d group.\nThe allocation of \u201cindirect expenses\u201d is to be made among groups of utilities \u201cin the proportion which the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group for that year bear to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all groups for that year.\u201d 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(b)(2). In implementing this provision, however, the PUC did not simply apportion its gross indirect expenses among the Utility Groups according to the percentage of gross revenues attributable to each group. Instead, before undertaking such an allocation, the PUC first divided its total indirect expenses into four more general and overlapping subcategories: expenses pertaining to \u201cMotor Carriers,\u201d \u201cTransportation,\u201d \u201cFixed Utility,\u201d or \u201cAll Utilities\u201d (collectively, the \u201cIndirect Expense Subcategories\u201d), essentially bunching expenses attributable to different and intersecting subsets of the Utility Groups. Only then did the PUC allocate the indirect expenses among the Utility Groups to which each Indirect Expense Subcategory or Subcategories attached. Since each of the Indirect Expense Subcategories \u201cMotor Carriers,\u201d \u201cTransportation,\u201d and \u201cAll Utilities\u201d attached to the \u201cMotor Carriers of Property\u201d Utility Group, indirect expenses from three of the four subcategories were allocated to UPS.\nUPS took the position that Section 510(b)(2) required the PUC to allocate \u201cthe balance of its expenditures,\u201d 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(b)(2), or its gross indirect expenses, among the Utility Groups according to proportionate gross revenues calculations only, and that the Commission\u2019s use of intervening and overlapping Indirect Expense Subcategories was therefore contrary to law. According to UPS, the insertion of the Indirect Expense Subcategories into the apportionment methodology resulted in members of the Motor Carriers of Property Utility Group shouldering an unduly large share of the Commission\u2019s indirect expenses. UPS claimed that the net effect in its case for three of its fiscal years spanning 1997 through 2000 was an unlawful overcharge of $563,683. It also argued that the assessments to it during this period were grossly disproportionate to UPS-related regulation expenses incurred by the Commission (particularly in light of the substantial deregulation of the carrier\u2019s business activities), thus violating Section 510(f)\u2019s prescription that each utility is to contribute only its \u201creasonable share of the cost of administering\u201d the Public Utility Code. 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(f).\nOn these grounds (and others that are not relevant here), UPS filed objections to the assessments pursuant to Section 510(d) of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(d). The PUC\u2019s Fiscal Office responded, taking the position that the Commission\u2019s methodology was consistent with the statutory framework, and its interpretation was entitled to deference. After consolidated discovery and hearings, an administrative law judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d) agreed with UPS that the Commission\u2019s use of the Indirect Expense Subcategories was inconsistent with Section 510(b)(2), and he therefore recommended that the relevant objections be sustained. See ALJ\u2019s Recommended Decision at 29-31, R.R. at 389-91 (\u201cSection 510(b)(2) of the Code is explicit that there is to be only one category of indirect charges \u2014 the \u2018balance of its expenditures\u2019 \u2014 which \u2018balance\u2019 is to be allocated on the basis of one separate \u2018proportion\u2019 for each utility group to which direct expenses were allocated under Section 510(b)(1).\u201d).\nIn its exceptions, the Fiscal Office maintained the argument that the Commission\u2019s administrative interpretation was valid. Further, it suggested that if the PUC endorsed the ALJ\u2019s construction of the statute, for purposes of UPS\u2019s contested assessments, the members of the Utility Groups should be reorganized into eight groups by combining the five transportation-related Utility Groups (Motor Carriers of Property, Motor Common Carrier, Railroad, Boats & Ferries, and Airplanes). The Fiscal Office indicated that this was necessary to fairly allocate the expenses among relevant subsets of utilities in light of corresponding regulatory activities of the PUC. This position corresponded to testimony from a Fiscal Office witness to the effect that the Indirect Expense Subcategories were akin to hybrid direct expense categories essential to fair apportionment.\nOn consideration of the ALJ\u2019s recommendation in these regards, the PUC rejected it, concluding that the Commission\u2019s methodology conformed with Section 510(b) in all material respects, since the statutory language was sufficiently broad to accommodate use of the Indirect Expense Subcategories. See Opinion and Order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, M-00981098, et al., slip op. at 18 (Mar. 9, 2001) (\u201cSubsection (b)(2) ... does not so delimit the group referenced there to those utilities furnishing the same type of service.\u201d). The Commission, however, also rejected its Fiscal Office\u2019s alternative proposal for realignment of the members of the Utility Groups, based on UPS\u2019s argument that the matter was not properly presented for decision since it had not been raised in the responses to UPS\u2019s objections or before the ALJ. See id. at 17 n. 9.\nUPS then initiated proceedings in the Commonwealth Court via a petition for review seeking an order compelling a refund, and the court treated the matter as filed within its original jurisdiction. See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 789 A.2d 353, 357 (Pa. Cmwlth.2001) (citing to 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(e)) (\u201cUPS 7\u201d). The Commonwealth Court framed UPS\u2019s argument as follows:\n[UPS] contends that the PUC erred in 'its interpretation of Section 510(b) of the Code when calculating the allocation of its indirect expenses by dividing the total indirect expenses for the Common Carrier of Property group into four subcategories.\nId. at 357-58 (emphasis added). As further discussed below, unfortunately the Commonwealth Court\u2019s use of the \u201cCommon Carrier of Property group\u201d terminology, and later use of the shorthand \u201cCommon Carrier,\u201d did not align with the nomenclature utilized by the Commission, thus generating uncertainty. This problem was compounded, because, contrary to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s assertion, UPS had not argued that the Commission improperly subdivided any discrete grouping of utilities; rather, as explained above, UPS complained that the Commission had inappropriately subdivided its overall indirect expenses (ie., those attributable to all utilities) into the four Indirect Expense Subcategories.\nNevertheless, the analysis offered by the Commonwealth Court tracked UPS\u2019s position fairly closely:\nSection 510(b)(1) is clear that the PUC shall determine the amount of its expenditures directly attributable to the regulation of each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service and debit the amount determined to such group. In the paragraph immediately following, Section 510(b)(2) provides that the PUC shall also determine the balance of its expenditures and allocate that balance to each group. This can only mean that the PUC must allocate its balance to each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service because no other types of groups are mentioned, and there is no support or rationalization for the PUC\u2019s allegation that subsection (b)(2) means it can allocate balances to subeategories of the individual group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service .... [F]or the PUC to interpret that \u201cgroup\u201d [a]s defined differently in subsection (b)(2) from all of the other subsections is incongruous.\nId. at 359 (emphasis in original). Additionally, the Commonwealth Court found the PUC\u2019s arguments to be \u201cdisingenuous and [to] ... conjure[ ] up an ambiguity where none exists in order to achieve an outcome it desires.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of UPS and directed the PUC to recalculate UPS\u2019s assessments for the fiscal years in question in accordance with the court\u2019s opinion. See id. More specifically, and perpetuating the ambiguity arising from its use of the term \u201cCommon Carriers,\u201d the Commonwealth Court indicated that \u201c[t]he calculations are to be based on the PUC\u2019s balance of expenditures only utilizing the group of Common Carriers once and not dividing its total indirect expenses into four subcategories.\u201d Id. Finally, the Commonwealth Court noted that UPS had raised a number of other issues, including its claim that the assessments were unreasonably high in violation of Section 510(f); in light of the court\u2019s disposition, however, the court found it unnecessary to reach such issues. Neither party filed a direct appeal to this Court.\nOn remand, the Commission recalculated UPS\u2019s assessments, but it did so by employing an entirely new assessment methodology akin to that which had been previously recommended by the PUC\u2019s Fiscal Office but which was rejected by the Commission. The PUC reordered the members of the twelve primary Utility Groups utilized for direct expense allocation into eight groupings by combining the transportation-related utility groups (Airplanes, Boats & Ferries, Motor Carriers of Property, Motor Common Carriers, and Railroads) into a single group that it denominated \u201cCommon Carriers.\u201d The Commission took the position that it was required to implement this realignment as a consequence of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s directive to \u201cutiliz[e] the group of Common Carriers once.\u201d Id. The effect was to fundamentally alter base figures used in the Commission\u2019s subsequent calculations \u2014 UPS was grouped with a broader segment of utilities than the former Motor Carriers of Property Utility Group, and several of the former subcategories of indirect expenses were recharacterized as direct expenses attaching the newly combined group. The PUC thus eliminated the Motor Carrier, Transportation, and Fixed Utility subcategorizations of indirect expenses, leaving only the \u201cAll Utilities\u201d designation as the repository for indirect expenses, to be divided proportionately (according to revenues) among the eight new groupings. Using this new methodology, the Commission determined that UPS was not entitled to a refund as it claimed, but rather, had in fact been undercharged by $595,290. The Commission, however, advised that it would forego supplemental payment by UPS due to its defense of the previous assessments.\nUPS then filed an application to enforce the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 2591(b), asserting that the PUC\u2019s actions in restructuring the foundational Utility Groups contravened the clear terms of the court\u2019s remand order. UPS emphasized that the Utility Group methodology, particularly with respect to direct expenses, had never been challenged in the case, was never addressed by the Commonwealth Court, and was a matter that should have been treated as settled for the three fiscal years at issue by virtue of various stipulations on the part of the Commission, as well as the Commission\u2019s own rejection of the Fiscal Office\u2019s proposal to combine the transportation-related utilities that was made during the administrative proceedings. Moreover, UPS noted that the Commission applied its methodology solely to obviate UPS\u2019s objections; obviously, the Commission could not and did not reassess the thousands of other utilities to which it had applied its original methodology pertaining to the applicable fiscal years.\nIn an unpublished decision, the Commonwealth Court (via single-judge memorandum) denied UPS\u2019s application. United Parcel, Inc. v. PUC, No. 822 C.D.2001, slip op. (Pa.Cmwlth.Apr. 3, 2002) (\u201cUPS II\u201d) Again, the court erroneously articulated UPS\u2019s claim as positing \u201cthe Commission impermissibly subdivided the group \u2018Motor Common Carriers\u2019 into four subgroups[.]\u201d Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court compounded this mistake by providing an explanation of its prior decision arising out of its misstatement of UPS\u2019s claim rather than from the reasoning of its prior opinion:\nWe only disagreed with the Commission\u2019s previous allocation of its expenses because it had divided the Motor Common Carrier into four sub-groups that not only included the transportation utilities (the Motor Carrier Group and the Transportation Group) but also included a \u201cFixed Utility Group\u201d consisting of all utility groups not within the transportation group and a fourth sub-group consisting of \u201cAll Utility Groups.\u201d Because two of those sub-groups contained utilities that were not related in any way to transportation, we ordered the Commission to recalculate UPS\u2019 allocation without subdividing the Motor Common Carrier group and grouping the utilities that provide the same kind of service together. That is what the Commission has now done.\nSince the PUC had never divided the Motor Carriers of Property Utility Group into four subgroups, or otherwise improperly associated it with fixed utilities in any of the Indirect Expense Subcategories eliminated by the PUC on remand, this reasoning is foundationless. Further, the explanation seems to convey that, whatever the Commonwealth Court had intended by its first order, when it used the term \u201cCommon Carrier\u201d in that opinion, it was referring to the Motor Carriers of Property Utility Group (which is the grouping that UPS\u2019s arguments implicated), and not some broader category of \u201cCommon Carriers\u201d as the Commission concluded and upon which it based its reassessments. Nevertheless, based on the analysis quoted above, the Commonwealth Court indicated that it could \u201cfind no fault\u201d with the Commission\u2019s regrouping of utilities on remand, since the members of the new \u201cCommon Carriers\u201d group all provided the same kind of services (transportation).\nIn UPS\u2019s present direct appeal, it notes that it filed an action for a refund on the ground that the Commission had assessed it amounts that were calculated in violation of the Public Utility Code; the Commonwealth Court entered judgment in its favor, holding that the Commission had in fact calculated the assessments in violation of the Code; and the matter was remanded for a recalculation in accordance with the court\u2019s reasoning which mirrored UPS\u2019s arguments. UPS contends that the Commission lacked the ability to change its method of calculating a judgment-winning utility\u2019s assessment, to alter aspects of the calculation method that were never at issue in the litigation, or to employ a calculation methodology inconsistent with that which was used to assess all other utilities for the same fiscal years. In support of its position, UPS invokes legal theories of waiver, judicial and collateral estoppel, and law of the case, predicated upon the Commission\u2019s: stipulation to the Utility Group categories; express rejection during the course of the litigation of a reordering of the Utility Groups based on its Fiscal Office\u2019s proposal; failure to give notice throughout that it sought to change the groupings; and failure to establish as of record the similarity of services provided by members of each new grouping. UPS also points out that, in fight of the prior ruling of the Commonwealth Court, which was ostensibly in its favor, the Commonwealth Court had declined to consider UPS\u2019s other claims (including its assertion that under Section 510(f) the Commission\u2019s methodology produced an unreasonably high assessment). Thus, UPS posits that the Commonwealth Court could not have intended the adverse result that was visited on UPS on remand. Finally, UPS contends that it is statutorily entitled to a refund under Section 510(d) of the Public Utility Code, which, as noted, provides that \u201c[i]f it is finally determined ... that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant.\u201d 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(d). The PUC relies largely on the contention that its actions on remand merely implemented the express directives of the Commonwealth Court. The Commission also faults UPS for failing to appeal the Commonwealth Court\u2019s initial-remand order.\nWe tend to agree with many of UPS\u2019s arguments. Although we are uncertain whether the Commonwealth Court was correct on the merits of the underlying matter, the fact of the matter is that UPS prevailed, and the PUC did not file a direct appeal. The Commission\u2019s assertion that UPS should have filed an appeal is without merit, since, as the prevailing party, UPS had no standing to appeal. See Pa.R.A.P. 501; Fierro v. Fierro, 434 Pa. 131, 132, 252 A.2d 652, 653 (1969) (explaining that an appealing party must be aggrieved, i.e., adversely affected, by order in order to have standing to appeal). While the Commonwealth Court\u2019s initial opinion was ambiguous and incorrect in several material respects, it simply did not foreshadow the adverse result that was visited upon UPS by the Commission on remand.\nEven putting these points aside, UPS is due relief, since the Commonwealth Court\u2019s central reasoning supporting its disposition in the enforcement phase of the proceedings was invalid. See supra pp. 9-10. Thus, it committed both errors of law and an abuse of discretion (since discretion cannot be properly invoked in an unreasoned framework). There is simply no account available for the discrepancy between UPS IPs explanation of UPS I\u2019s outcome (namely, that it was predicated entirely on an inappropriate division by the PUC of the Motor Carrier Group into subcategories, see supra pp. 9-10), and UPS Ps actual, expressed rationale (based on the PUC\u2019s failure to allocate its gross indirect expenses among the Utility Groups according to gross revenue calculations only and without reference to the four Indirect Expense Subcategories, see supra p. 7 (citing UPS I, 789 A.2d at 359)). Further, the Commonwealth Court has improperly deprived UPS of requested judicial review of several of its claims \u2014 this is particularly troubling since it was done on the ostensible basis that UPS had prevailed in the litigation. Finally, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s treatment would appear to divest UPS of any opportunity to challenge on its merits the new apportionment methodology that has been interjected upon it at a late stage of the proceedings.\nUPS Ps mandate was for recalculation of assessments to UPS during the relevant time period in accordance with the terms of the opinion. Based on the above, we conclude that the decision\u2019s core reasoning, read in light of the issues that were properly before the court, required both the elimination of the Indirect Expense Subcategories and reallocation of gross indirect expenses among the stipulated, twelve Utility Groups according to proportionate gross revenues. Again, we acknowledge the ambiguity arising from UPS Ps additional directive that \u201c[t]he calculations are to be based on the PUC\u2019s balance of expenditures only utilizing the group of Common Carriers once and not dividing its total indirect expenses into four subcategories.\u201d Nevertheless, we find that the only reasoned interpretation of this language in its context is that it merely clarifies the PUC\u2019s obligation on remand to allocate a single, revenue-based share of its gross indirect expenses to the Motor Carriers of Property Utility Group.\nFor these reasons, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order pertaining to the enforcement phase of the proceedings is vacated, and the case is remanded for recalculations of the relevant assessments. For purposes of these calculations, the direct expense portions of the relevant assessments are to be restored to their original form, i.e., allocated among the Utility Groups as defined in this opinion (eleven or twelve, depending upon the fiscal year of the assessment). The Commission\u2019s gross indirect expenses are to be allocated among the same Utility Groups for each assessment year, per Section 510(b)(2), in the proportion that the gross intrastate operating revenue for each Utility Group bears to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all Utility Groups for that year.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a dissenting opinion in which Justice NEWMAN joins.\nChief Justice CAPPY, dissenting.\nIn my view, the majority decides this appeal on issues that the appellant, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), did not raise, and grants UPS relief that UPS did not request. I must, therefore, respectfully dissent.\nThis appeal arises out of the Application to Enforce Unappealed Final Decision (\u201cApplication to Enforce\u201d) that UPS filed in the Commonwealth Court. In the Application to Enforce, UPS asserted that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (\u201cPUC\u201d) failed to comply with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s prior order in United Parcel Service, Inc. v. PUC, 789 A.2d 353 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) (\u201cUPS I\u201d), in re-calculating UPS\u2019 expense assessments. The Commonwealth Court, however, rejected UPS\u2019 assertion, and concluded in its memorandum and order dated April 3, 2002 (\u201cUPS II\u201d), that the PUC followed its order in UPS I to the letter. That is, the Commonwealth Court held that the PUC utilized the group of Common Carriers once and did not divide its total indirect expenses into four subcategories when recalculating UPS\u2019 assessments, as it had been ordered to do in UPS I. It is this ruling, in UPS II, and no other, that is currently before us.\nAccording to the majority, this case must be remanded to the Commonwealth Court \u201csince the Commonwealth Court\u2019s central reasoning supporting its disposition in the enforcement phase of the proceedings was invalid. Thus, it committed both errors of law and an abuse of discretion (since discretion cannot be properly invoked in an unreasoned framework).\u201d (Majority Opinion at -, 830 A.2d at 948). I cannot agree. In its memorandum opinion, the Commonwealth Court explained what it meant in the order it issued in UPS I; explained why it concluded that the PUC complied with that order; and explained how the PUC did not repeat the errors in recalculating UPS\u2019 assessments that had led to that order in the first place. Whether this court agrees with the Commonwealth Court or not, I am at a loss to understand the majority\u2019s characterization of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision as \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cunreasoned\u201d or to discern what more the majority is directing the Commonwealth Court to do on remand when it re-evaluates its ruling.\nIn its opinion, the majority focuses on the ambiguities and references to the Common Carrier grouping that, as the majority points out, appear throughout the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion and order in UPS I. This is because those ambiguities and references are what led to the PUC\u2019s manner of recalculation and are what caused UPS not to receive a refund.\nI can, however, find no authority for the majority\u2019s willingness to reach back and discuss questions that arise out of the language the Commonwealth Court used in UPS I. Nor can I find any support for the majority\u2019s apparent decision to have the Commonwealth Court re-visit its opinion and order in UPS I on remand. In its Application to Enforce, UPS did not urge the Commonwealth Court to reconsider or modify the language that appears in either the opinion or order in UPS I. All that UPS asked the Commonwealth Court to do was to enforce that order as written.\nTherefore, in the present appeal, it is the majority, not UPS, that raises these matters. In doing so, the majority ignores Pa.R.A.P. 302 which states that \u201c[ijssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal[,]\u201d and violates a cardinal rule of appellate jurisprudence, and one which this court has repeatedly upheld \u2014 namely, that an appellate court will refrain from raising issues sua sponte. See Danville Area School District v. Danville Area Educ. Ass\u2019n, 562 Pa. 238, 754 A.2d 1255, 1259 (2000).\nAccordingly, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order that denied UPS\u2019 Application to Enforce.\nJustice NEWMAN joins this dissenting opinion.\n. The Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c), prohibits a state from enacting or enforcing any law or regulation related to price, route, or service of any interstate motor carrier of property, except carriers of household goods.\n. The parties dispute the degree to which the deregulation of the motor carrier industry has impacted upon the Commission\u2019s expenses.\n. Once this allocation is accomplished, the PUC assesses individual members of each group based on the proportion that each member\u2019s gross intrastate operating revenues bears to the revenues of the combined members of such group.\n.At some point, the PUC decreased the total number of Utility Groups to eleven, combining Electric and Electric Generators into a single group, apparently for reasons unrelated to this matter. For convenience, the Utility Groups are referred to throughout as numbering twelve.\n. The \"Motor Carrier\u201d Indirect Expense Subcategory attached to the Motor Carriers of Property and Motor Common Carriers Utility Groups; the \"Transportation\u201d subcategoiy attached to Motor Carriers of Property, Motor Common Carriers, Railroads, Boats & Ferries, and Aircraft; the \"Fixed Utility\u201d subcategory attached to the remaining Utility Groups not within the \"Transportation\u201d subcategory; and the \"All Utility\u201d subcategory included all twelve Utility Groups.\n. It did so by apportioning the gross indirect expenses for each Indirect Expense Subcategory among the Utility Groups attached to the Indirect Expense Subcategory according to the percentage of gross revenues attributable to each group.\n. Once the indirect expenses were assigned to the Utility Groups, they were apportioned among individual members of each group (along with the direct expenses), based on the proportion that each member\u2019s gross intrastate operating revenue bears to the revenues of the combined members of such group. See supra note 3.\n. Section 510(d) provides that \"[i]f it is finally determined ... that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant.\u201d 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(d).\n. Presumably, at this juncture in its opinion, the Commonwealth Court meant to refer to the \"Motor Carrier of Property\u201d Utility Group.\n. The PUC docket nonetheless reflects that the Commission recently notified UPS that it intends to apply the new formula to UPS\u2019s assessments in future years that are the subject of separate administrative proceedings before the Commission.\n. As noted, UPS has consistently maintained that the Commission erroneously segregated its total indirect expenses (those attributable to all utilities) into the four subcategories. See supra.\n. Because the case proceeded within the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction pursuant to 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 510(d), UPS\u2019s current appeal from the denial of its application to enforce the order resulting from that original action at law is properly before this Court.\n. See generally Riedel v. Human Relations Comm'n of City of Reading, 559 Pa. 34, 41, 739 A.2d 121, 125 (1999) (holding that the Commonwealth Court lacked authority to reverse on the basis of a waived issue that the court raised sua sponte); Wing v. Commonwealth, Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, 496 Pa. 113, 118, 436 A.2d 179, 181 (1981) (\"It is difficult to imagine what could be more prejudicial to claimants than if, after nearly two years of litigation and appeals, they find themselves before the lower tribunal and again forced to litigate issues long since waived, and uncertain if yet other, novel theories will be thrust upon them[.]\u201d); Commonwealth v. Tick, Inc., 431 Pa. 420, 425, 246 A.2d 424, 426 (1968) (recognizing the obligation of a subordinate tribunal to strictly comply with the mandate of a reviewing court without modifying, altering, amending, setting aside or in any manner disturbing or departing from the judgment of that court); 46 South 52nd St. Corp. v. Manlin, 404 Pa. 159, 160, 172 A.2d 154, 155-56 (1961) (explaining that the failure to adhere to a reviewing court\u2019s order \"gives proper consideration neither to the rights of the successful litigant nor to the mandate of our court\u201d); Haefele v. Davis, 380 Pa. 94, 98, 110 A.2d 233, 235 (1955).\n. The dissent posits that the above addresses issues not raised and preserved by UPS. See Dissenting Opinion, op. at -, --, 830 A.2d at 949, 950. As noted, however, UPS has consistently maintained its central claim that the PUC's interpretation of UPS I reached well beyond the potential scope of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s remand order in light of UPS I's reasoning and the limited claims that were put before the court there. Our decision is based on a fundamental endorsement of such position. That UPS I contained ambiguities did not authorize the implementation of an unreasonable interpretation beyond the scope of the proceedings.\n. Given the limited scope of these proceedings, our determination here pertains solely to assessments to UPS during the periods under review; we offer no opinion concerning assessment methodology that may be available to the Commission within the confines of the guiding statute on a prospective basis.\n. The Commonwealth Court entered the following order in UPS I:\nBecause the PUC misinterpreted Section 510(b) of the Code and, therefore, miscalculated UPS\u2019 assessments as well as those of all other utilities furnishing the same kind of service, the case is remanded to the PUC for a recalculation of UPS\u2019 assessments. The calculations are to be based on the PUC\u2019s balance of expenditures only utilizing the group of Common Carriers once and not dividing its total indirect expenses into four subcategories.\nId. at 359-60 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).\n. In support of the relief it gives to UPS, the majority opinion states that UPS as the \"prevailing party\u201d in UPS I was precluded under Pa.R.A.P. 501 from filing an appeal from the order entered therein. (Majority Opinion at -, 830 A.2d at 948). Assuming for argument's sake that UPS would not have been authorized to appeal from, that order based on the assertion that the order as written aggrieved it and harmed its interests, my disagreement with the majority remains. UPS could have raised the questions the majority raises about the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion and order in UPS I in its Application to Enforce. UPS, however, did not do so.",
