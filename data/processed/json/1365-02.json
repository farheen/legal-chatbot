Although we believe that the defendant\u2019s appeal was interlocutory, we have decided that the interests of both parties require us to address the matter of subject matter jurisdiction on the merits.\nConsequently, the defendant\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed. The case is remanded to the Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this order.\nFAY, C.J., and SHEA, J., did not participate.",
