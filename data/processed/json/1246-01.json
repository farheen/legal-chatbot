        "text": "GLICKMAN, Associate Judge:\nThe question presented in this appeal is whether a defendant tortfeasor whose liability insurer is insolvent has the right to require the plaintiff to exhaust his potentially applicable uninsured motorist insurance before the plaintiff enforces his judgment against the defendant, where the District of Columbia Insurance Guaranty Association has elected to honor the insolvent insurer\u2019s coverage obligations to the defendant without requiring such exhaustion. We hold that the defendant does not have that right.\nI.\nWhile driving his taxi cab on June 23, 1994, Ellec Mosley struck Ronald Welch, a pedestrian, injuring Welch\u2019s right leg. Three years later, Welch brought a personal injury action in Superior Court against Mosley and his employer, Capital Cab Cooperative Association, Inc. At the time, Mosley had available up to $25,000 in motor vehicle insurance coverage from Capital Casualty Insurance Company, Inc. (\u201cCCIC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Cab.\nCapital Cab successfully moved for summary judgment and was dismissed from the action in mid-1998. Not long thereafter, in a separate proceeding, the court declared CCIC insolvent and ordered that it be liquidated. As a result, Welch\u2019s action against Mosley was stayed for six months to permit the District of Columbia Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cDCI-GA\u201d) to assume CCIC\u2019s defense and other obligations in accordance with the Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act of 1993 (\u201cthe IGA Act\u201d), now codified as D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 31-5501 to 31-5515 (2001).\nAfter the stay was lifted, the case proceeded to trial in April 2000 with Mosley as the sole defendant. The jury found Mosley liable and awarded Welch $75,000 in damages. Mosley then filed a post-trial motion for partial relief from the judgment. Mosley argued that because the DCIGA had replaced CCIC as his insurer, the IGA Act applied to Welch\u2019s claim and required Welch to exhaust whatever rights he had to uninsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage under his own motor vehicle insurance policy as a precondition to enforcing his judgment against Mosley. Mosley asked the court to stay Welch\u2019s collection efforts against him \u201con any sum the equivalent amount of which is found to be available in an alternative source of insurance, presumably, the uninsured motorists provision of plaintiffs automobile insurance policy.\u201d Welch opposed Mosley\u2019s motion on various grounds. Welch acknowledged-that he had his own motor vehicle insurance policy in 1994, when Mosley injured him. Among other things, however, Welch argued that by 1998, when CCIC became insolvent, it would have been too late for him to make a claim under his 1994 policy. Welch further claimed that he no longer could identify the insurance carrier that had issued that policy. Most important, Welch argued that the Act did not afford Mosley any rights against him and did not oblige Welch to exhaust his own insurance coverage before he could enforce his judgment by levying on Mosley\u2019s assets.\nNo stay was in effect while Mosley\u2019s post-trial motion was pending. During that time, Welch obtained writs of fieri facias on Mosley\u2019s real and personal property and writs of attachment against his wages and savings; and the court entered judgment of condemnation for Welch against $ 27,488.08 in Mosley\u2019s bank account. In August 2000, the trial court denied Mosley\u2019s post-trial motion on the ground that it was \u201cnot supported by the evidentiary record of the case.\u201d Thereafter, counsel have informed us, Welch collected the balance of his judgment from Mosley\u2019s assets while DCIGA honored CCIC\u2019s coverage obligation to Mosley and paid him $25,000.\nII.\nMosley appeals only the denial of his post-trial motion. He renews his contention that the IGA Act required Welch to exhaust his own UM insurance coverage before he could levy on Mosley\u2019s assets. We reject this contention and affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nThe IGA Act provides a mechanism for the DCIGA to pay claims against insurers that become insolvent. See generally Zhou v. Jennifer Mall Rest., Inc., 699 A.2d 348, 351-54 (D.C.1997); District of Columbia Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 721 F.Supp. 1378, 1380 (D.D.C. 1989), aff'd, 288 U.S.App.D.C. 257, 925 F.2d 488 (1991). If an insurer becomes insolvent, \u201cthe DCIGA steps in to act as if it were the insolvent insurer.\u201d Id. The DCIGA assumes \u201call rights, duties and obligations of the insolvent insurer,\u201d including the obligation to pay \u201ccovered claims.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5505(a)(2) (2001). A \u201ccovered claim\u201d includes- \u201can unpaid claim ... submitted by a claimant, which arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy\u201d issued by the insolvent -insurer. D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5501(6) (2001). Thus, in the present case, the DCIGA assumed CCIC\u2019s obligation to insure Mosley up to the policy limit of $25,000.\nThe IGA Act also contains a provision that is designed to avoid duplicate insurance recoveries and protect the funds of the DCIGA by requiring claimants to exhaust other sources of insurance for covered claims. In pertinent part, the provision states:\nAny person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy, other than a policy of an insolvent insurer which is also a covered claim, shall be required to exhaust first his or her right under such a policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such an insurance policy.\nD.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a) (2001). This provision therefore requires: \u201c1) that a claimant with an alternative source of insurance coverage for a covered claim must first exhaust that alternative source[] before seeking compensation from the DCIGA, and 2) that the DCIGA\u2019s obligation be reduced by the amount of duplicate coverage of the covered claim from alternative sources of insurance.\u201d Zhou, 699 A.2d at 352. These requirements prevent claimants from obtaining \u201cdouble recovery or windfall by virtue of an insurance company\u2019s insolvency.\u201d Id.\nAs we explained in Zhou, these non-duplication requirements of the .IGA Act may be triggered when UM coverage is available for a claim against the DCIGA:\nThis situation typically arises in the following circumstances: driver A, who has uninsured motorists insurance, is involved in an accident with driver B, the tortfeasor. When driver B\u2019s insurance is declared insolvent, driver A recovers from his or her own uninsured motorists policy. Driver A then attempts to recover from the [DCIGA] which has stepped into the shoes of the tortfeasor\u2019s insolvent insurer. Because the claim against driver A\u2019s uninsured motorists policy is the same claim as the one brought against driver B\u2019s insolvent insurer, the [DCIGA] can deduct the amount recovered from the injured party\u2019s uninsured motorists policy from the amount it is statutorily obligated to pay to the injured party.\nId. at 354. If it were otherwise, and the DCIGA received no credit for UM insurance payments, more insurance coverage would be available for the claim than if the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer had remained solvent.\nIn the present case, therefore, before it paid CCIC\u2019s coverage obligation to Mosley itself, the DCIGA presumably could have insisted that Welch make a claim against his own motor vehicle insurer under the UM provisions of his policy. The DCIGA would have been entitled to a credit for any UM payments that Welch received. Alternatively, even after it paid Mosley, the DCIGA perhaps might have pursued reimbursement by invoking its rights under D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a). But the DCI-GA has not asserted its statutory rights to exhaustion and set-off in any manner.\nMosley nonetheless argues that D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a) gives policy holders of insolvent insurers the same rights it gives the DCIGA to require prior exhaustion and set-off. In other words, even though the DCIGA honored CCIC\u2019s coverage obligation to Mosley, he argues that he is entitled as well to a credit for any UM insurance that Welch could have obtained. This would further the IGA Act\u2019s goal, Mosley suggests, of avoiding financial loss to policy holders from insurer insolvencies.\nWe do not think that Mosley\u2019s argument is correct. The purpose of D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a) is to avoid duplicate insurance recoveries and protect the funds of the DCIGA, not to reduce the liability of insureds or provide them with more asset protection than if their insurers had not become insolvent. When he received the payment from the DCIGA, Mosley received all the protection that the IGA Act was supposed to provide. If, in addition to the DCIGA\u2019s payment, Mosley were to receive a credit in the amount of Welch\u2019s available UM insurance, Mosley would be better off than if CCIC had remained solvent. He would be the beneficiary of a windfall. That is not what the IGA Act was meant to accomplish. The statute does not leave room for doubt on this point. The last sentence of D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a) states that \u201c[a]ny amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such an insurance policy.\u201d This sentence refers only to amounts payable by the DCIGA, because only the DCIGA has the obligation under \u201cthis chapter\u201d to pay a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Only the DCIGA itself, we conclude, has the right provided by D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a) to require a claimant to exhaust other insurance coverage and to reduce its own exposure to the extent of such other coverage. The DCIGA has not asserted that right in this case. The trial court therefore did not err in denying Mosley\u2019s post-trial motion, and we affirm the judgment on appeal.\nSo ordered.\n. Formerly codified as D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-3901 to 35-3915 (1997). For convenience this opinion will cite to the current statutory codification.\n. Motor vehicle insurance policies sold in the District of Columbia must provide a minimum of UM coverage for insureds who are entitled to damages from owners or operators of \"uninsured motor vehicles,\u201d a term that includes vehicles whose insurers become insolvent. See D.C.Code \u00a7 31-2406(f)(l)(B) (2001).\n. There is an another important implication of the principle that \"where an injured plaintiff has alternative sources of insurance covering the same claim as the claim against the insolvent insurer, ... the nonduplication provision [requires] the plaintiff to exhaust the solvent policy and deduct the amount recovered from the obligation due by the [DCI-GA].\u201d Id. That implication is that the plaintiff's solvent insurer is stuck with the loss up to the limit of the insolvent insurer's coverage obligation and is not subrogated to the plaintiff's claim against the tortfeasor whose insurer became insolvent (except insofar as the solvent insurer\u2019s payments exceed the insolvent insurer\u2019s obligation). If the plaintiff\u2019s insurer could turn around and recover its payments to the plaintiff by suing the tortfea-sor, then the protection afforded the tortfea-sor by the IGA Act would be reduced or even nullified.\n. The trial court denied Mosley\u2019s post-trial motion without a hearing, and thus without resolving whether Welch in fact could have made a claim under the UM provisions of his insurance policy. If D.C.Code \u00a7 31-5509(a) entitled Mosley to require Welch to exhaust his own insurance coverage, further fact-finding as to the availability and amount of that coverage would be necessary.",
