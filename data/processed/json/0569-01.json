        "text": "SCHWELB, Associate Judge,\nconcurring:\nWinters appeals from an order of the trial court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He contended below, and continues to maintain on appeal, that by declining to credit him with \u201cgood time,\u201d the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (DOC) has unlawfully prolonged the term that he must serve pursuant to his \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence for first degree murder. A majority of the division votes to affirm. I concur and state my reasons for doing so in this opinion. Judge Ferren concurs separately. Judge Mack dissents.\nI\nTHE LEGISLATION\nThis case involves the interplay between the District of Columbia\u2019s first degree murder statute, which was designed to ensure that those convicted of premeditated murder be adequately punished for their crimes, and its \u201cgood time credit\u201d legislation, which was intended to relieve prison overcrowding, to encourage prisoners to rehabilitate themselves, and, implicitly, to temper justice with mercy in those cases in which such tempering is appropriate.\nOn or about December 6, 1977, following a jury trial, Winters was convicted of murder in the first degree and of robbery. In conformity with the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d provisions of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2404(b), he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of twenty years to life on the murder count. He received a concurrent sentence of five to fifteen years for robbery. He remains incarcerated pursuant to his sentence for murder.\nThe statute under which Winters was sentenced provides that persons convicted of murder in the first degree must serve at least twenty years in prison without parole. It reads as follows:\n\u00a7 22-2404 Penalty for murder in first and second degrees.\n(a) The punishment of murder in the first degree shall be life imprisonment.\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person convicted of first-degree murder and upon whom a sentence of life imprisonment is imposed shall be eligible for parole only after the expiration of 20 years from the date he commences to serve his sentence.\n(c) Whoever is guilty of murder in the second degree shall be imprisoned for life or not less than 20 years.\nThe District of Columbia Good Time Credits Act of 1986 (GTCA), D.C.Code \u00a7 24-428 et seq. (1989) became effective on April 11, 1987. Section 24-428(a) provides in pertinent part that\n[ejvery person who is convicted of a violation of a District of Columbia (\u201cDistrict\u201d) criminal law by a court in the District of Columbia, imprisoned in a District correctional facility, and whose conduct is in conformity with all applicable institutional rules is entitled to institutional good time credits in accordance with the provisions of this section.\nPrior to the enactment of the GTCA, good time credit was allowed only against the maximum sentence, and the prisoner was required to serve his entire minimum sentence. See Solomon v. United States, 569 A.2d 1185, 1186 (D.C.1990). The GTCA liberalized the law by allowing good time credit to reduce a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence. Id. A defendant serving a sentence of ten years or more may earn ten days good time credit for each month of his sentence. D.C.Code \u00a7 24-428(a)(5).\nThe GTCA tempers mercy with justice, and contains certain explicit exceptions from the benefits which it confers. Section 24-434 states that\n[\u00a1Institutional and educational good time credits shall not be applied to the minimum terms of persons sentenced under the District of Columbia Mandatory-Minimum Sentences Initiative of 1981, effective March 9, 1982 (D.C. Law 4-166, \u00a7\u00a7 22-3202, 33-501 and 33-541).\nIn the 1981 initiative to which \u00a7 24-434 alludes, the voters of this jurisdiction adopted mandatory minimum sentences for persons convicted of certain armed crimes, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3202 (1989), or of distribution of controlled substances and related offenses, D.C.Code \u00a7 33-541 (1988). See generally Lemon v. United States, 564 A.2d 1368, 1379 (D.C.1989).\nPersons imprisoned in the District of Columbia are placed in the custody of the District\u2019s Department of Corrections (DOC), which administers the sentence imposed by the court. In May 1987, one month after the effective date of the GTCA, the Director of the DOC issued a departmental order specifying that the Act does not apply to inmates serving twenty-year mandatory minimum sentences for first degree murder pursuant to \u00a7 22-2404(b). See DOC Order No. 4340.2, at para. 10 (1987). Several months later, the Director adopted formal rules to the same effect. 35 D.C.Reg. 1077 (February 9, 1988). The effect of the order and of the subsequent rules was that defendants convicted of first degree murder would continue to serve the full twenty-year minimum term without parole, notwithstanding the enactment of the GTCA.\nOn May 15, 1989, however, Honorable Joyce Hens Green held in Cunningham v. Williams, 711 F.Supp. 644 (D.D.C.1989), app. pending Nos. 89-1571, 89-5203 (U.S.App.D.C.), that a prisoner who had been convicted of first degree murder was entitled to receive the benefits of the GTCA. Rejecting the District\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d in \u00a7 22-2404(b), when coupled with the policy disfavoring repeals by implication, supported the DOC\u2019s construction of the Act, Judge Green wrote that\nthe natural meaning of the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law is law existing at the time \u00a7 22-2404(b) was passed. The Good Time Credits Act was passed subsequent to \u00a7 22-2404(b). Accepting the position urged by inter-venor would mean that the Council could never modify former law. The Court refuses to endorse such a patently untenable position. Furthermore, as stated above, the D.C.. Council spoke in no uncertain terms when it enacted the Good Time Credits Act. Had it desired to exclude \u00a7 22-2404(b) from the Act\u2019s reach, it clearly knew how to do so and it could have done so, but it did not do so. The Act\u2019s language is clear.\n711 F.Supp. at 646 (emphasis in original).\nThe Council\u2019s reaction to Judge Green\u2019s decision was swift and emphatic. On May 30, 1989, fifteen days after the Cunningham opinion was issued, the Council unanimously passed the District of Columbia Good Time Credits Amendment Emergency Act of 1989, D.C. Act 8-41, which proscribed the application of the GTCA to persons convicted of first degree murder. The Council also passed the cumbersomely styled \u201cGood Time Credits Amendment Act of 1989 Emergency Declaration Resolution of 1989,\u201d the operative sections of which read as follows:\nSec. 2. (a) There exists an immediate crisis regarding the application of good time credits to the minimum sentence of persons convicted for first degree murder.\n(b) On May 15, 1989, U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Hens Green rendered a decision in the case of Eugene Jerome Cunningham v. Hallem H. Williams [711 F.Supp. 644] (Civil Action No. 88-3732) in which she decided that the District of Columbia Good Time Credits Act of 1989, effective April 11, 1987 (D.C.Law 6-218; D.C.Code, sec. 24-428 et seq.) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), must be applied to persons convicted of first degree murder under section 801 of An Act To establish a code of law for the District of Columbia, approved March 3, 1901 (31 Stat. 1321; D.C.Code, sec. 22-2404(b)) (\u201cCriminal Code\u201d).\n(c) The application of the Act to persons convicted of first degree murder would reduce the minimum term for persons convicted after the effective date of the Act by approximately one third'and reduce the minimum sentence of persons convicted before the effective date of the act to a period of less than 20 years.\n(d) The Council of the District of Columbia never intended the Act to apply to persons convicted for first degree murder.\n(e) The Council of the District of Columbia believed that the \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d language of section 801 of the Criminal Code (D.C.Code, sec. 22-2404(b)) would exclude first degree murder from coverage of the Act as it applies to minimum sentences.\n(f) The enactment of the proposed emergency legislation will clarify the Council\u2019s intent with regard to first degree murder by specifically excluding that crime from the coverage of the Act as it applies to minimum sentences.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances enumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the District of Columbia Good Time Credits Emergency Amendment Act of 1989 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n36 D.C.Reg. 4283-4284 (1989).\nIn order to assure that there would be no \u201cgap\u201d between the expiration of the Emergency Act and the enactment of permanent legislation, see United States v. Alston, 580 A.2d 587 (D.C.1990), the Council also enacted temporary legislation containing essentially the same language as the Emergency Act and excluding persons convicted of first degree murder from the benefits of the GTCA. 36 D.C.Reg. 4740 (1989). On July 11, 1989, the Council passed permanent legislation to the same effect. 36 D.C.Reg. 5761 (1989). Following the required period of Congressional review, the amendment became effective on January 30, 1990.\nThe District concedes, as it must, that Winters\u2019 case is governed by the GTCA as it read prior to its amendment in 1989. It is not contended that the 1989 amendment may be applied to Winters retroactively. The District maintains, however, that the Council\u2019s actions in 1989 provide persuasive evidence of its intent in 1986, and that persons convicted of first degree murder were never intended to benefit from the GTCA. Although the question is not free from difficulty, I am constrained to agree.\nII\nDISCUSSION\nIn interpreting two statutes which somewhat paradoxically appear to be nudging it in opposite directions, the court must look first of all to their language. If the words are not dispositive, then we should examine the legislative history and the administrative construction of the Act. In the present case, we also have before us a declaration by the Council which was in office in 1989 as to the meaning of legislation enacted by a prior Council in 1986. Utilizing all of these clues as guideposts, I embark on the search for the holy grail of legislative intent.\nA. The Statutory Language.\nAs this court recently had occasion to observe in Riggs National Bank v. District of Columbia, 581 A.2d 1229, 1235 (D.C.1990),\n\u201c[i]n interpreting a statute, we are mindful of the maxim that we must look first to its language; if the words are clear and unambiguous, we must give effect to its plain meaning.\u201d J Parreco & Son v. District of Columbia Rental Hous. Comm\u2019n, 567 A.2d 43, 45 (D.C.1989) (citations omitted). \u201cThe words used [in the statute], even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing.\u201d Id. at 46 (quoting Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.) (per Learned Hand, J.), aff'd, 326 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945)). Although \u201cit is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary,\u201d Parreco, supra, 567 A.2d at 46 (quoting Cabell, supra, 148 F.2d at 739), it is useful to have one around.\nThe \u201cplain language\u201d of the GTCA, when read in isolation, lends significant support to Winters\u2019 position. As Judge Green pointed out in Cunningham, supra, \u201cthe ordinary and natural reading of the D.C. Good Time Credits Act is that petitioner is entitled to institutional good time credits.\u201d 711 F.Supp. at 645. Section 24-428(a) provides that \u201cevery person who is convicted of a violation of District of Columbia law\u201d is entitled to the benefits of the Act. Judge Green emphasized that the Council had specified certain exceptions to the reach of the statute but had not included persons convicted of first degree murder among the exceptions so enumerated. Id. at 645-46. She concluded that the Council\u2019s enumeration of specific exceptions, coupled with its omission of any others,\nevinces a clear intent that the Act\u2019s provision for good time credits applies to every prisoner convicted and sentenced under a D.C. statute other than those specifically listed in D.C.Code \u00a7 24-434.\n(Emphasis in original.) Accord, Andrus v. Glover Construction Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17, 100 S.Ct. 1905, 1910-11, 64 L.Ed.2d 548 (1980) (\u201cwhere Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied in the absence of a contrary legislative intent\u201d).\nWe are dealing here, however, with two enactments, rather than with one, and must also consider the language of the first degree murder statute. Section 22-2404(b) provides that a person convicted of first degree murder must receive a life sentence and serve at least twenty years without parole, notwithstanding any other provision of law. This is strong stuff. Judge Green thought that the italicized phrase applies only to a law which was in effect at the time \u00a7 22-2404(b) was enacted, and that any other construction would imply that the Council could never modify its past actions. Cunningham, supra, 711 F.Supp. at 646. Although the legislature cannot make any statute unrepealable, however, I think the language at issue here should be construed less restrictively than Cunningham suggests. As the court stated in Illinois National Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 272 U.S.App.D.C. 187, 194, 854 F.2d 1396, 1403 (1988) (quoting New Jersey National Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 677 F.2d 276, 283 (3d Cir.1982)),\n[ljooking first to the statutory language, we immediately confront the preface to section 709(e) of the Technician Act, which explicitly provides that its terms apply \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ...\u201d [emphasis added]. A clearer statement is difficult to imagine; section 709(e) must be read to override any conflicting provision of law in existence at the time that the Technician Act was enacted. Application of this statement is less certain, however, with respect to a statute such as the Labor-Management Act, adopted after the Technician Act. The drafters of section 709(e) can hardly be said to have had the Labor-Management Act specifically within their contemplation. Even so, the preemptive language is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend any other, more general, legislation, whenever enacted, to qualify the authority of the state adjutants general as set out in the Technician Act. The language does not preclude a subsequent change of heart on the part of Congress, but it does suggest that any qualification of the terms of section 709(e) would be accepted by Congress only after some consideration of the factors requiring or permitting such a change.\n(Emphasis added to next-to-last sentence). See also post at 581-584 (Ferren, J. concurring). I agree with this approach, and conclude that the insertion of the words \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d means, at least, that any claim that a subsequent enactment was designed to reduce the mandatory minimum penalty for first degree murder must be analyzed with some caution before an intent to modify a well-entrenched policy may legitimately be inferred.\nRepeals by implication are not favored. Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 549, 94 5.Ct. 2474, 2482, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974); Speyer v. Barry, 588 A.2d 1147, 1164-66 (D.C.1991); Simon v. Simon, 58 App.D.C. 158, 159-60, 26 F.2d 530, 531-32 (1928). As Judge (now Justice) Scalia wrote for the court in United States v. Hansen, 249 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 26, 772 F.2d 940, 944 (1985),\n[i]t will not do to give this principle of statutory interpretation mere lip service and vacillating practical application. A steady adherence to it is important, primarily to facilitate not the task of judging but the task of legislating. It is one of the fundamental ground rules under which laws are framed. Without it, determining the effect of a bill upon the body of preexisting law would be inordinately difficult, and the legislative process would become distorted by a sort of blind gamesmanship, in which Members of Congress vote for or against a particular measure according to their varying estimations of whether its implications will be held to suspend the effects of an earlier law that they favor or oppose.\nSee also Speyer, supra, 588 A.2d at 1165 (quoting Hansen with approval).\nMoreover, the GTCA deals with punishment for crimes generally, while \u00a7 22-2404(b) addresses the narrower and more specific subject of the penalty for first degree murder. \u201cThe force of [the doctrine that repeals by implication are not favored] is greater still when it is urged that a specific statute has been superseded by a later but more general one.\u201d Illinois National Guard, supra, 272 U.S.App.D.C. at 196, 854 F.2d at 1405.\nAlthough the Council exempted certain mandatory minimum offenses from the reach of the GTCA, but did not include persons convicted of first degree murder in the exempted category, it did not expressly repeal the twenty-year mandatory minimum in \u00a7 22-2404(b). If the Council had explicitly addressed the language of the first degree murder statute and expressly stated that the mandatory minimum there established was no longer in effect, then we ought to have no hesitation in giving effect to such a declaration. It does not appear, however, that the Council wrestled with this particular question and, although the literal meaning of the GTCA is unquestionably helpful to Winters, it is not as conclusive as a specific allusion would have been. I am therefore of the opinion that if the two statutes are read side by side, the Council\u2019s intent is not sufficiently clear to obviate the need for inquiry into other sources from which such intent can be discerned.\nB. The Legislative History.\nThe District and Winters both rely in some measure on the legislative history of the 1986 version of the GTCA to support their respective interpretations. In my judgment, however, that history is inconclusive.\nThe parties have not brought to our attention any discussion by the members of the Council of the precise issue here presented. My own examination has likewise uncovered none. Two of the members who supported the legislation, Mrs. Polly Shackleton and Mr. John Ray, apparently assumed that it would not affect mandatory minimum sentences, and they did not differentiate between those imposed under the 1981 sentencing initiative and those for first degree murder. No member of the Council challenged the interpretation offered by Mrs. Shackleton and Mr. Ray.\nWinters relies heavily on a lengthy letter to the Chairman of the Council from Joseph E. DiGenova, Esq., who was then United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, and who was strongly opposed to the passage of the bill. Mr. DiGenova claimed that the proposed legislation \u201cwould allow a person sentenced to a mandatory minimum, pursuant to several of the provisions of the District of Columbia Code, to be released before serving the required minimum simply by adhering to the rules of the institution.\u201d He argued specifically that first degree murder \u201cwas not exempt from the bill\u2019s good time provisions.\u201d\nBut \u201cthe fears and doubts of the opposition are no authoritative guide to the construction of legislation.\u201d Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue, 488 U.S. 19, 29, 109 S.Ct. 278, 284, 102 L.Ed.2d 186 (1988) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has often\ncautioned against the danger, when interpreting a statute, of reliance upon the views of its legislative opponents. In their zeal to defeat a bill, they understandably tend to overstate its reach.\nN.L.R.B. v. Fruit & Vegetable Packers & Warehousemen, Local 760, 377 U.S. 58, 66, 84 S.Ct. 1063, 1068, 12 L.Ed.2d 129 (1964). \u201cAn unsuccessful [opponent] cannot put words into the mouths of the majority and thus, indirectly, amend a bill.\u201d Mastro Plastics Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 350 U.S. 270, 288, 76 S.Ct. 349, 361, 100 L.Ed. 309 (1956). \u201cIt is the sponsors that we look to when the meaning of the statutory words is in doubt.\u201d Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394-95, 71 S.Ct. 745, 750-51, 95 L.Ed. 1035 (1951). In the present case, we have nothing definitive from the sponsors, and the remarks of Mrs. Shackleton and Mr. Ray tend, if anything, to support the District\u2019s position.\nWinters also contends that a report by Kathryn R. Monaco, a corrections official from New Mexico who was appointed to advise the District\u2019s Department of Corrections as to how best to comply with court orders regarding conditions at its facilities, supports his construction of the GTCA. Ms. Monaco recommended that \u201cgood time\u201d be credited to minimum sentences, and noted that while in the District a person convicted of first degree murder must serve twenty years without good time, a person convicted of that offense in Virginia receives life imprisonment, which usually amounts to fifteen years, and which may be reduced by \u201cgood time\u201d to slightly more than ten years. Winters maintains that since the Monaco Report was presented to the Council, and since much of it was adopted, the Council must have intended to conform its law to that of Virginia in regard to first degree murder.\nI am unable to agree with Winters\u2019 argument, however, because Virginia\u2019s statutory law is fundamentally different from the District\u2019s in critical respects. Virginia has a category of homicide known as capital murder, for which the penalty is death or imprisonment for life. Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31, 18.2-10(a) (1990). First degree murder, the second most severe form of homicide, carries a penalty of imprisonment for life or for a period of no less than twenty years. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-32, 18.2-10(b). One cannot fairly draw an analogy between the most serious homicides in the District and the second most serious ones in Virginia. Virginia defendants convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to death obviously cannot receive credit for good time.\nC. Administrative Construction.\nThe District urges that in construing the GTCA, the court should give substantial weight to its administrative construction by the Department of Corrections. Almost immediately after the enactment of the statute, as I have noted, the Director of the DOC interpreted it as having no application to persons convicted of first degree murder. The Department subsequently issued formal rules to the same effect.\nCourts accord great weight to any reasonable interpretation given to a statute by an agency charged with its administration or enforcement. Winchester Van Buren Tenants Ass\u2019n v. District of Columbia Rental Hous. Comm\u2019n, 550 A.2d 51, 55 (D.C.1988). This is particularly true where, as here, we have a \u201ccontemporaneous construction of a statute by the men [and women] charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion and making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.\u201d Id., (quoting Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 358, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933) (per Cardozo, J.)).\nThe District argues that deference is especially appropriate in this case. It says that the Council\u2019s failure to repeal or revise the GTCA in the face of its administrative construction constitutes persuasive evidence that this construction was the one which the Council intended. See, e.g., Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1, 11, 85 S.Ct. 1271, 1278, 14 L.Ed.2d 179 (1965). Winters responds that there is no evidence that the Council was aware of the DOC\u2019s construction of the Act. \u201cLegislative silence cannot mean ratification unless, as a minimum, the existence of the administrative practice is brought home to the legislature.\u201d Thompson v. Clifford, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 361, 408 F.2d 154, 164 (1968). Nevertheless, there is a striking and arguably meaningful contrast between the Council\u2019s silence for more than two years in face of the administrative construction and the alacrity and vehemence with which that body reacted when confronted with Judge Green's contrary interpretation of the GTCA in Cunningham. The force of the Council\u2019s expression of displeasure with the view that first degree murderers are entitled to good time suggests that even if the members of the Council did not know of DOC\u2019s interpretation, they would have been pleased with it if they had known.\nDOC\u2019s order and rule, however, can only take us so far in this case. The issue before us is one of statutory construction, and the record contains no analysis by the Department of Corrections of the statutory language, nor is there any other indication of the agency\u2019s reasoning. The interplay between two different statutes enacted many years apart may not present the kind of problem in which administrative expertise is especially helpful. Moreover, there is no claim here that DOC officials helped to prepare or write the GTCA, and the weight accorded to an agency\u2019s construction is at its zenith \u201cwhen the administrators participated in drafting and directly made known their views to [the legislature] in committee hearings.\u201d Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 192, 90 S.Ct. 314, 327-28, 24 L.Ed.2d 345 (1969). Finally, Winters has made a reasonably persuasive textual argument with respect to the GTCA, and this court has not hesitated to override an administrative interpretation which apparently runs afoul of statutory language. See, e.g., Parreco, supra, 567 A.2d at 48-49 and authorities there cited. All in all, we think that the administrative construction tilts in the District\u2019s favor, but not very much.\nD. The 1989 Legislation and Resolution.\nThe District relies heavily on the Council\u2019s explicit declaration in 1989 with respect to what the GTCA of 1986 was intended to mean. The present case is somewhat unusual, in that the 1989 Council not only amended the statute, apparently for purposes of clarification, but also passed a resolution explaining exactly what the 1986 Council had on its mind. In Section 2(d) of the Emergency Declaration Resolution of 1989, the Council declared that the 1986 Council \u201cnever intended the Act to apply to persons convicted of first degree murder.\" In Section 2(e), the 1989 Council explained that the 1986 Council had believed that the \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d language in \u00a7 22-2404(b) \u201cwould exclude first degree murder from coverage of the Act as it applies to minimum sentences.\u201d\nTen of the thirteen members of the 1986 Council, including the three who co-introduced the original GTCA \u2014 Chairman Clarke and Councilmembers Rolark and Mason \u2014 were members of the 1989 Council. The 1989 legislation and resolution passed unanimously. In the absence of evidence that the members of the Council were mistaken, or worse, about what they initially intended \u2014 and I emphasize that there is no such evidence \u2014 the 1989 legislation and resolution are surely revealing as to what the 1986 Council intended to accomplish.\nA note of caution is in order. Retroactive interpretation by legislators of their past enactments should be approached with a measure of circumspection. \u201cThe views of a subsequent Congress[] form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d McIntosh v. Washington, 395 A.2d 744, 750 (D.C.1978) (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S.Ct. 326, 332, 4 L.Ed.2d 334 (I960)). See also Holt v. United States, 565 A.2d 970, 975 (D.C.1989) (en banc). The interpretation of statutes is, in the final analysis, the responsibility of courts, not of subsequently elected legislative bodies. Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 566, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550-51, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988).\nIn the present instance, the Council expressed in no uncertain terms its view that the trial court\u2019s decision in a pending case {Cunningham) had misconstrued the legislative intent. The Cunningham decision either had been, or was about to be, appealed. In fact, the appeal remains pending as of the time of this writing. The Council\u2019s intervention could have the consequence of altering the result in a case which was still in litigation in the federal courts. The problems presented are therefore sensitive ones. They implicate the doctrine of separation of powers, and they are not at all easy.\nBut \u201c[subsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statutory construction.\u201d Red Mon Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 380-81, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801-02, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). This principle is a \u201cvenerable one.\u201d Id. at 381 n. 8, 89 S.Ct. at 1801-02 n. 8. Almost a century and a half ago, the Supreme Court declared that \u201cif it can be gathered from a subsequent statute in pari materia, what meaning the legislature attached to the words of a former statute, they will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute.\u201d United States v. Freeman, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 556, 564-65, 11 L.Ed. 724 (1845). This is especially true where, as here, \u201c[t]his enactment was evidently intended to remove any doubt previously existing as to the meaning of the statute and declare its true construction and meaning.\u201d Bailey v. Clark, 88 U.S. 284, 288, 22 L.Ed. 651 (1874). The views of a subsequent legislature are not conclusive as to the intent of an earlier one, but they carry \u201cconsiderable retrospective weight.\u201d Heckler v. Turner, 470 U.S. 184, 211, 105 S.Ct. 1138, 1152, 84 L.Ed.2d 138 (1985); see also Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 444 U.S. 572, 597, 100 S.Ct. 800, 814, 63 L.Ed.2d 36 (1980); Federal Housing Administration v. The Darlington, Inc., 358 U.S. 84, 90, 79 S.Ct. 141, 145-46, 3 L.Ed.2d 132 (1958); 2A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, \u00a7 49.11, at 414 (Sands 4th ed.1984).\nThat the 1989 Council\u2019s interpretation of the GTCA of 1986 was contained in a legislative resolution does not invalidate it. Since the Mayor plays no role in the passage of a resolution, a resolution cannot amend a statute. 1A Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 22.14, at 216. Prior legislation may, however, be interpreted or construed by a resolution. Id. Moreover, the resolution in this case is altogether consistent with emergency, temporary and permanent legislation which was enacted by the Council, signed by the Mayor, and permitted by Congress to go into force. The views of the 1989 Council on the issue before us are not in doubt.\nIn the present case, considerable weight should be given to the 1989 legislation and resolution. Relatively little time elapsed between the enactment of the GTCA and the Council\u2019s actions in 1989. Most of the legislators were members of the Council at both relevant times. The Council responded swiftly, unambiguously and unanimously to the decision in Cunningham. The Councilmembers provided specific and relevant details of their intent in 1986 and of what they understood existing legislation to mean. The Council\u2019s reliance on the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d whether correct or not, was certainly not unreasonable. See Illinois National Guard, supra, and the discussion at pp. 573 to 574. The question whether persons convicted of first degree murder were entitled to good time credits was not a one-sided one. The trial judge in this case and at least two judges of the United States District Court reached a result contrary to that in Cunningham. See Davis v. Williams, No. 88-2896 (D.D.C. June 8, 1990) (Lamberth, J.); Caldwell v. Barry, No. 88-1394 (D.D.C. May 25, 1989) (Rever-comb, J.). Under these circumstances, I think it incumbent upon us to treat the declarations in the 1989 resolution as presumptively accurate and credible; we simply have no reason to disbelieve the members of the Council when they expressly and unambiguously describe their initial intent.\nIll\nCONCLUSION\nI do not think it necessary to decide precisely how much weight the court would accord to the 1989 resolution if the statutory language, the legislative history and the administrative construction tilted forcefully towards Winters. I am of the opinion that they do not. Without the events of 1989, this would be a very close case. In light of those events, and the closeness of the question otherwise, I vote to credit the 1989 Council and sustain the judgment of the trial court.\n. Habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy. See Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh, 274 U.S.App.D.C. 398, 404 n. 5, 864 F.2d 804, 810 n. 5 (1987).\n. At least two members of the Council invoked biblical principles in this regard. In the words of Mrs. Wilhelmina Rolark, who chaired the Judiciary Committee, the GTCA\nhas, I think a laudable purpose which is to address the prison situation. I know that there has been misbehavior. There have been violations of our laws, but after all it is part of the Christian ethic that a man or a woman can reform.\nMrs. Nadine Winter, however, expressed \u201cdeep concerns\" about reducing the minimum sentence when \u201ca little old lady ... has been robbed or beaten.\u201d\nI agree wholeheartedly, it's a part of the Christian ethics. But I also use the Old Testament. Her reference was, presumably, to the notion of an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d or \"tooth for a tooth.\" See Exodus 21:24.\n. Resolutions may be used, inter alia, \"to express simple determinations, decisions, or directions of the Council of a special or temporary character.\" D.C.Code \u00a7 1-229 (1987).\n. The permanent legislation provides in pertinent part that\n[^Institutional and educational good time credits shall not be applied to the minimum terms of persons sentenced under the District of Columbia Mandatory-Minimum Sentences Initiative of 1981 ... or section 4(b) of an Act ... approved July 8, 1932 (47 Stat. 650; D.C.Code sec. 22-3204(b)).\n. Judge Green\u2019s analysis finds further support in the rule of lenity. \"In case of doubt concerning the penalty prescribed by a statute, construction will favor a milder penalty over a harsher one.\u201d Riggs, supra, 581 A.2d at 1262 (quoting 3 N. Singer, Sutherland, Statutory Construction, \u00a7 59.-03, at 11 (4th ed. 1986) (hereinafter Sutherland)); see also Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980); Lemon, supra, 564 A.2d at 1381. \u201cThis policy embodies the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should.\" United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522-23, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting H. Friendly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes, In Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967)). Mandatory minimum statutes restrict a judge's traditional sentencing discretion, and the application of the rule of lenity is especially appropriate to resolve ambiguities in legislation of this kind. See Du-pree v. United States, 583 A.2d 1000, 1004 n. 5 (D.C. 1990), and the concurring opinion, id. at 1004-05 (D.C. 1990); see also United States v. Stokes, 365 A.2d 615, 619 (D.C.1976) (applying rule of lenity and holding that youthful defendant convicted of first degree murder may be sentenced under former Federal Youth Corrections Act). To be sure, the rule of lenity is a secondary canon of construction, and is to be invoked only where the statutory language, structure, purpose and history leave the intent of the legislature in genuine doubt. Lemon, supra, 564 A.2d at 1381. The significance of the doctrine in this case, however, is that it tends to confirm the ordinary meaning of the language of one of the statutes under consideration.\n. In her dissenting opinion, Judge Mack refers to the \"plain language\" of the GTCA. In my view, however, the language of the two statutes, read together, is not at all plain.\n. The United States contended at argument, and the District also maintains, that it is unreasonable to ascribe to the 1986 Council the intention to allow good time for first degree murderers but not for armed offenders sentenced pursuant to the 1981 initiative. Since the mandatory minimum for a second armed offense is ten years with no parole and no good time, see Lemon, supra, 564 A.2d at 1379-81, and since as much as ten days per month can be subtracted from a prisoner\u2019s sentence under the GTCA, the two sovereigns suggest that the Council could not have intended that defendants convicted of offenses so disparate in seriousness receive comparable periods of imprisonment.\nWinters counters that the Council might well have been reluctant to override mandatory minimum sentencing provisions overwhelmingly ratified by the voters in the 1981 initiative, but less hesitant to reduce the punishment for first degree murder, which was fixed by the legislature, not by the electorate. Winters also correctly notes that several members of the Council emphasized that eligibility for good time credits would not automatically result in the early release of first degree murderers; the parole board is not required to grant parole as soon as a prisoner becomes eligible.\nNeither side\u2019s argument clearly refutes that of its adversary. Common sense does suggest that the Council might not have intended what Winters claims it intended, but the statutory text points, at least in some measure, in an opposite direction. This court has been reluctant \"to invoke too readily the \u2018absurd result\u2019 doctrine, or related notions which are said to justify the disregard of statutory language,\u201d for a due respect for the principle of separation of powers counsels us not to substitute the judicial will for that of the legislature as expressed in that body\u2019s words. Parreco, supra, 567 A.2d at 46.\n. Defending the legislation against the contention that it would result in the release of dangerous criminals, Mrs. Shackleton stated that\n[t]his is not mandatory to the Parole Board. It also does not affect mandatory sentences.\nMr. Ray concurred:\nAs Mrs. Shackleton pointed out, this law does not apply to the mandatory minimum sentencing. It impacts upon that in no way.\n. The parties have extracted several other nuggets from the legislative history and have attempted to turn them to their own advantage. We find none of the nuggets to be either golden or conclusive.\n. Citing INS v. Cardoza Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1221, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) and Amalgamated Transit Union v. Skinner, 282 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 328, 894 F.2d 1362, 1368 (1990), Winters argues that the issue before us is a \"pure\u201d question of statutory construction and that deference to the DOC\u2019s interpretation is not warranted. This overstates the holdings in these cases. Both stand for the familiar proposition that the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory interpretation and that courts must reject an administrative construction which is contrary to the clear legislative intent.\n. Winters relies on United States v. Stokes, discussed at page 572 n. 4, supra, in which this court, in a 2:1 decision, sustained the authority of the trial judge to sentence a defendant convicted of first degree murder pursuant to the former Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 (1970), thus exempting him from the mandatory minimum penalty. In Stokes, this court followed the lead of the United States Court of Appeals in United States v. Howard, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 10, 449 F.2d 1086 (1971), also a 2:1 decision. The decisive distinction between the present case on the one hand and Stokes and Howard on the other is that there was no aroused legislative reaction to the earlier decisions, while Cunningham precipitated an instant firestorm. Moreover, Stokes and Howard would have exempted only youthful first degree murderers from the mandatory minimum sentence, whereas the result for which Winters contends would apply to all of those who were sentenced prior to the 1989 amendment.\n. Or Council.\n. With due respect to Judge Ferren, I do not see how the Council\u2019s swift and emphatic negative reaction to the Cunningham decision could possibly \"undermine\" my conclusion that the court in that case had misinterpreted the 1986 statute. As soon as they learned of it, all ten remaining Councilmembers said in no uncertain terms that the judge\u2019s interpretation of the original GTCA was not in conformity with their intent when they enacted the statute. Surely Judge Ferren does not think that a hesitant and long-delayed declaration would be more probative of the Council\u2019s original intent than a forceful and prompt one.",

FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 380-81, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). But many, if not most, canons of statutory construction are offset by equally forceful counter-canons. Thus, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court often has said \u201cthe views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S.Ct. 326, 331-32, 4 L.Ed.2d 334 (1960), quoted in McIntosh v. Washington, 395 A.2d 744, 750 n. 12 (D.C.1978). Depending on the circumstances, therefore, a reviewing court may \u2014 or may not \u2014 find significance in the postenactment views of legislators who purport to express the understanding of an earlier legislature that enacted the statute at issue.\nJudge SCHWELB justifies reliance on the Council\u2019s 1989 resolution to reveal the 1986 Council\u2019s intent underlying the Time Credits Act for three reasons: \u201c[Relatively little time elapsed between the enactment of the GTCA and the Council\u2019s actions in 1989,\u201d \u201c[m]ost of the legislators were members of the Council at both relevant times,\u201d and \u201c[t]he Council responded swiftly, unambiguously and unanimously to the decision in Cunningham.\u201d Ante at 578. Although Judge SCHWELB\u2019S first two reasons tend to support his argument, the third \u2014 the Council\u2019s swift, negative reaction to Cunningham \u2014 substantially undermines it.\nI believe a postenactment declaration of legislative intent, clearly intended to affect pending litigation, is inherently suspect. Even if the declaration truly reflects earlier legislative intent, (which may or may not reflect the intent of the Mayor in signing, and the Congress in not vetoing the legislation), it appears to be intended to affect judicial review. I have no reason to believe that the motives behind the 1989 Council declaration were not entirely honorable. It is not difficult, however, to imagine that a legislative body on some other occasion\u2014 confronted by a public outcry against a trial court decision interpreting ambiguous legislation to create a very unpopular right \u2014 could conveniently, and retroactively, find an intent that had never been thought of, let alone declared, at the time of enactment, and thereby cause erasure of what the reviewing court otherwise, using appropriate interpretive tools, might have found to be a newly established right. The analysis Judge SCHWELB employs here could apply to that kind of situation as well. From that perspective, a speedy postenactment reaction by a legislature comprised mostly of members who had voted on the earlier enactment could appear to be primarily an effort to protect the legislators\u2019 own interests at the polls, rather than to reflect their earlier intention \u2014 or more likely their earlier lack of intention \u2014 applicable to the issue later presented.\nI do not go so far as to say that posten-actment legislative views should never be accorded weight; clearly the caselaw permits this on occasion. Compare supra note 1 with supra note 8. I express concern here only about legislative declarations clearly intended to affect pending litigation \u2014 a situation that may present temptation to compromise honesty with expediency. Accordingly, rather than make a postenactment declaration, such as the 1989 resolution, determinative \u2014 as Judge SCHWELB does \u2014 I would relegate it to corroborative or derogative evidence at best after resolving the matter on the basis of the statutory language, aided as necessary by legislative history and applicable canons of statutory construction.\nII.\nIn this case we have two statutes to review. The District of Columbia Good Time Credits Act of 1986, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 24-428(a) and -434 (1989), provides:\n(a) Every person who is convicted of a violation of a District of Columbia (\u201cDistrict\u201d) criminal law by a court in the District of Columbia, imprisoned in a District correctional facility, and whose conduct is in conformity with all applicable institutional rules is entitled to institutional good time credits in accordance with the provisions of this section.... [Emphasis added.]\n* * * * * *\nInstitutional and educational good time credits shall not be applied to the minimum terms of persons sentenced under the District of Columbia Mandatory-Minimum Sentences Initiative of 1981, effective March 9, 1982 (D.C.Law 4-166, \u00a7\u00a7 22-3202, 33-501 and 33-541).\nThe first degree murder statute adopted many years earlier, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-2404(a) and (b) (1989), provides:\n(a) The punishment of murder in the first degree shall be life imprisonment.\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person convicted of first-degree murder and upon whom a sentence of life imprisonment is imposed shall be eligible for parole only after the expiration of 20 years from the date he commences to serve his sentence. [Emphasis added.]\nThese two statutes, each containing a provision limiting early release from prison, arguably conflict with each other as applied to first degree murder. Absent \u00a7 22-2404(b), the 1986 Act, \u00a7\u00a7 24-428(a) and -434, would make good time credits available to \u201c[e]very person\u201d convicted of first degree murder; and, absent the 1986 Act, no good time credits could possibly reduce the 20 year minimum sentence for first degree murder. Accordingly, because either statute would cause a different result without the other, we must construe them together. See Holt v. United States, 565 A.2d 970, 975 (D.C.1989) (statutory provisions having same purpose or subject matter are in pari materia and should be construed together). More specifically, according to the Supreme Court:\nThe correct rule of interpretation is, that if divers statutes relate to the same thing, they ought all to be taken into consideration in construing any one of them, and it is an established rule of law, that all acts in pari materia are to be taken together, as if they were one law.\nUnited States v. Freeman, 44 U.S. 556, (3 How.), 564-65, 11 L.Ed. 724 (1845) (citations omitted).\nSuperficially, we could apply Freeman\u2014 viewing the statutes as \u201cone law,\u201d id. at 564 \u2014 and quickly conclude that \u201c[e]very person\u201d convicted of a District of Columbia criminal law \u201cis entitled to institutional good time credits,\u201d provided that [1] such credits \u201cshall not be applied to the minimum terms of persons sentenced under the District of Columbia Mandatory-Minimum Sentences Initiative of 1981,\u201d and that [2] \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person convicted of first degree murder\u201d and sentenced to life imprisonment \u201cshall be eligible for parole only after the expiration of 20 years from the date he commences to serve his sentence.\u201d The very structure of the statute fashioned by tacking together the two provisions at issue reflects a general rule subject to two compatible exceptions.\nGiven, however, that these statutes were enacted many years apart and that the Cunningham court has construed the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 22-2404(b) as applying only to \u201claw existing at the time \u00a7 22-2404(b) was passed,\u201d we have to inquire further into how these statutes should be deemed to relate, absent illuminating legislative history. See ante at 575-576.\nFirst, I find no basis for the Cunningham court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d language of \u00a7 22-2404(b) was intended to apply only to laws in effect at the time of its enactment. It is true that \u00a7 22-2404(b) was adopted to make clear that someone convicted of first-degree murder, in contrast with second-degree murder, could not have a life imprisonment term reduced below 20 years by reference to the Indeterminate Sentences Act, D.C.Code \u00a7 24-203(a) (1989) (where maximum sentence is life imprisonment, \u201ca minimum sentence shall be imposed which shall not exceed 15 years of imprisonment\u201d). See H.R.Rep. No. 677, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1961). But this is not to say that Congress had no intention whatsoever of protecting the 20-year minimum under \u00a7 22-2404(b) against later, more generally stated legislation that arguably could affect the penalty for first degree murder. Literally, the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 22-2404(b) applies to subsequent, as well as to existing, laws \u2014 although with an uncertain reach.\nRecently, in Illinois Nat\u2019l Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., 272 U.S.App. D.C. 187, 854 F.2d 1396 (1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dealt with a similar issue. The court considered whether the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 (current version at 32 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 709, 715 (1988)), exempted the National Guards of Illinois, Wyoming, and California from the later-enacted bargaining requirements of the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982 (current version at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6101, 6130(a) (1988)). The Technician Act provision at issue committed \u201cestablishment of work schedules to the unfettered discretion of the Secretary\u201d of the Army, whereas the later Schedules Act required \u201cbargaining over work schedules.\u201d 272 U.S.App.D.C. at 193, 854 F.2d at 1402. The Technician Act, however, explicitly provided that its terms were to apply \u201c[Notwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d Id. at 192, 854 F.2d at 1401. Quoting with approval from a Third Circuit case construing a similar provision of the Technician Act with reference to an arguably preemptive provision of the later Labor-Management Relations Chapter of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (current version at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135 (1988)), the court wrote:\nLooking first to the statutory language, we immediately confront the preface to section 709(e) of the Technician Act, which explicitly provides that its terms apply \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ...\u201d [emphasis added]. A clearer statement is difficult to imagine: section 709(e) must be read to override any conflicting provision of law in existence at the time that the Technician Act was enacted. Application of this statement is less certain, however, with respect to a statute such as the Labor-Management Act, adopted after the Technician Act. The drafters of section 709(e) can hardly be said to have had the Labor-Management Act specifically within their contemplation. Even so, the preemptive language is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend any other, more general, legislation, whenever enacted, to qualify the authority of the state adjutants general as set out in the Technician Act. The language does not preclude a subsequent change of heart on the part of Congress, but it does suggest that any qualification of the terms of section 709(e) would be accepted by Congress only after some consideration of the factors requiring or permitting such a change.\nId. at 194, 854 F.2d at 1403 (quoting New Jersey Air Nat\u2019l Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., 677 F.2d 276, 283 (3d Cir.) (emphasis in original), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 988, 103 S.Ct. 343, 74 L.Ed.2d 384 (1982)).\nAccordingly, the D.C. Circuit has interpreted a \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause identical to the one at issue here not merely to protect a statute against automatic repeal by subsequently enacted legislation covering the same field, but also to mean that a subsequent law, in order to preempt the earlier one, must reflect legislative \u201cconsideration of the factors requiring or permitting\u201d the alleged change. Id.\nIn adopting and applying this analysis, the Circuit Court found no legislative history that indicated Congress had intended the bargaining provisions of the 1982 Schedules Act to trump the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause of the 1968 Technician Act. The court then concluded that the earlier Technician Act provision had to apply because, according to applicable canons of statutory construction, \u201crepeals by implication are not favored\u201d and \u201ca specific statute controls over a general one without regard to priority of enactment.\u201d Id. 272 U.S.App. D.C. at 195, 196, 854 F.2d at 1404, 1405 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nIt is unclear how much the court in Illinois National Guard relied on the \u201cpowerful evidence\u201d of the \u201cpreemptive language\u201d in the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause and how much the court premised its analysis, more generally, on canons of statutory construction absent clarifying language or legislative history. See id. at 194, 854 F.2d at 1403. My sense is that the court relied primarily on interpretive canons with the result made easier by the force of the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause language in the earlier statute. I believe this approach is applicable here. Whether we focus on the subject of good time credits or more narrowly on the subject of mandatory minimum sentences, the later-enacted Good Time Credits Act is more general \u2014 more broadly applicable \u2014 than the first-degree murder statute. According to the Supreme Court:\nIt is a basic principle of statutory construction that a statute dealing with a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum. \u201cWhere there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of the priority of enactment.\u201d Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550-551, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2483, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 [1974].\nRadzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 153, 96 S.Ct. 1989, 1992-93, 48 L.Ed.2d 540 (1976) (footnote omitted); see Rodgers v. United States, 185 U.S. 83, 87, 22 S.Ct. 582, 583, 46 L.Ed. 816 (1902) (\u201cIt is a canon of statutory construction that a later statute, general in its terms and not expressly repealing a prior special statute, will ordinarily not affect the special provisions of such earlier statute\u201d).\nIn Radzanower, the Court held that the \u201cnarrowly drawn, specific venue provision of the National Bank Act must prevail over the broader, more generally applicable venue provision of the Securities Exchange Act.\u201d Id. at 158, 96 S.Ct. at 1995. The Court elaborated on the Canon that \u201crepeals by implication are not favored,\u201d acknowledging there are\n\u201ctwo well-settled categories of repeals by implication \u2014 (1) where provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one; and (2) if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier act. But, in either case, the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest_\u201d Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S.Ct. 349, 352, 80 L.Ed. 351 [1936].\nId. 426 U.S. at 154, 96 S.Ct. at 1993. The Court then noted:\nThe statutory provisions at issue here cannot be said to be in \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d in the sense that there is a positive repugnancy between them or that they cannot mutually coexist. It is not enough to show that the two statutes produce differing results when applied to the same factual situation, for that no more than states the problem. Rather, \u201cwhen two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the court ... to regard each as effective.\u201d Morton v. Mancan, [417 U.S.] at 551, 94 S.Ct. at 2483.\nId. 426 U.S. at 155, 96 S.Ct. at 1993. The Court concluded that nothing in the legislative history of the Securities Exchange Act supported \u201cthe view that Congress in enacting it gave the slightest consideration to the pro tanto repeal of \u00a7 94 [of the National Bank Act], let alone to indicate \u2018that Congress consciously abandoned its [prior] policy,\u2019 or that its intent to repeal \u00a7 94 pro tanto was \u2018 \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 158, 96 S.Ct. at 1995 (citations omitted).\nThis analysis in Radzanower applies a fortiori in cases such as Illinois National Guard and the instant one where a \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause warns against easy repeal by subsequent, general legislation. As indicated earlier, both the mandatory m\u00ednimums in the first-degree murder statute, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2404(b), and in the Good Time Credits Act, id. \u00a7 24-434, can mutually coexist as exceptions to the \u201cEvery person\u201d language of the latter Act, id. \u00a7 24-428(a); there is no \u201cirreconcilable conflict.\u201d Radzanower, 426 U.S. at 155, 96 S.Ct. at 1992-93. There is \u201cno clear intention,\u201d express or otherwise, that the Good Time Credits Act supersede the first-degree murder statute. Id. at 153, 96 S.Ct. at 1992-93. Thus, this court has a duty \u201cto regard each as effective.\u201d Id. at 155, 96 S.Ct. at 1993 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn short, Radzanower and Illinois National Guard dictate the result here; I see no reason even to get into, let alone rely on, the 1989 Council declaration of the 1986 Council\u2019s intent. Accordingly, for reasons that differ from Judge SCHWELB\u2019S analysis, I, too, would affirm.\n. See, e.g., Heckler v. Turner, 470 U.S. 184, 211, 105 S.Ct. 1138, 1152-53, 84 L.Ed.2d 138 (1985) (1984 legislation intended to clarify current law leaves no doubt as to prospective interpretation of statute but \"carries in addition considerable retrospective weight\u2019\u2019); Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v.

        "text": "MACK, Senior Judge,\ndissenting:\nI am in complete accord with the reasoning of Judge Green in Cunningham v. Williams, 711 P.Supp. 644 (D.D.C.1989), that the plain language and the purpose of the Good Time Credits Act of 1986, coupled with the rules of \u201clenity\u201d and logic, compel the conclusion that every person then convicted and imprisoned in the District of Columbia who engaged in conforming conduct, was entitled to receive the benefits of that legislation (with one specifically noted exception). Indeed, I find much of the analysis employed by my colleague, Judge Schwelb, to add further support to, rather than to detract from, the result reached by Judge Green.\nLike both of my colleagues, Judge Schwelb and Judge Ferren, I recognize that, in discerning legislative intent, it is a hazardous process to rely upon the views of a subsequent legislature to identify the intent of an earlier one. I agree with Judge Ferren, therefore, that in the circumstances of this case, it would be judicially inappropriate for us to credit the 1989 Council declaration of the 1986 Council\u2019s intent. We can no more determine the \u201csubjective\u201d intent of an earlier legislature than can a subsequent legislature. That is why Judge Green in Cunningham was correct in starting with the fundamental canon of the plain language of the GTC Act of 1986 and giving conclusive weight to that language.\nMoreover, because we are here dealing with legislation which affects the length of criminal sentences, I believe it is also (constitutionally speaking) hazardous to \u201cborrow\u201d (as Judge Ferren has done) from the \u201cgeneral and specific\u201d canons of civil statutory construction to here make the Murder I statute uniquely paramount. The question is not whether there is a \u201ccounter-canon\u201d of statutory construction that would prevent the application of Judge Fer-ren\u2019s approach, but whether the approach can be lawfully applied to these penal provisions. Through the ex post facto prohibition of the Constitution, \u201cthe Framers sought to assure that legislative Acts give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed.\u201d Two critical elements identify an ex post facto law: it must be retrospective and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. Id. at 580. The alteration of credits given as a matter of grace to prison inmates who abide by prison rules may fall within its prohibition.\nIn my view all persons serving sentences in the District of Columbia on April 11, 1987, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 22-2404(b) are entitled to earn \u201cgood-time\u201d credits for any conforming conduct during the two year period between April 11, 1987 and May 30, 1989, which could advance the time of their eligibility to apply for parole.\nI respectfully dissent.\n. See the District of Columbia Mandatory-Minimum Sentences Initiative of 1981 (D.C.
