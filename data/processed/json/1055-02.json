Connors v. Gasbarro, 448 A.2d 756, 759 (R.I.1982). Our review of the evidence supports the decision of the trial justice. The jury\u2019s verdict was not clearly wrong, and the trial justice was within his discretion to uphold their decision.\nConsequently, we deny and dismiss the appeal, and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.\nWEISBERGER, Acting C.J., did not participate.",
