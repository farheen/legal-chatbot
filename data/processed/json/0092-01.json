        "text": "GORMAN, J.\n[\u00b6 1] Aubert A. and Christiane Godb-out appeal from a judgment entered in the Superior Court (Cumberland County, Nivison, J.) dismissing as time-barred their products liability complaint against WLB Holding, Inc., fik/a W.L. Blake & Co. The Godbouts contend that the court\u2019s application of the Maine Business Corporation Act\u2019s statute of repose to their complaint violates the purposes of the Act and the \u201copen courts\u201d provision of the Maine Constitution. Alternatively, the Godbouts contend that they should be allowed to file a direct action against WLB\u2019s insurer to afford them their right to redress. We affirm the judgment.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n[\u00b6 2] On February 14, 2008, the Godb-outs instituted proceedings in the Superior Court against W.L. Blake & Co. and WLB Holding, Inc. f/k/a W.L. Blake & Co. (WLB), asserting several asbestos-related causes of action in connection with Au-bert\u2019s diagnosis of mesothelioma. There is no dispute that WLB dissolved by notice published on May 22, 2004, pursuant to 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1410 (2009).\n[\u00b6 3] On WLB\u2019s motion, the court dismissed the Godbouts\u2019 complaint after concluding that the three-year statute of repose applicable to dissolved corporations barred the Godbouts\u2019 claims against WLB. See 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7 1408(3)(C). The Godb-outs appealed.\nII. DISCUSSION\n[\u00b6 4] The Maine Business Corporation Act, 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101-1702 (2009) contains a subset of provisions regulating the voluntary dissolution of corporations. See 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1410. Among these provisions, the Act requires that a voluntarily dissolved corporation complete various steps to dispose of claims, both known and unknown at the time of dissolution, against the dissolved corporation. 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1407-1408. As to claims unknown at the time of the dissolution, the corporation must publish notice of its dissolution and request that claimants present their claims to the corporation. 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7 1408(1), (2). Section 1408 requires that any claims against dissolved corporations be filed within three years after the corporation published notice of its dissolution:\n3. Claim barred. If the dissolved corporation publishes a newspaper notice in accordance with subsection 2, the claim of each of the following claimants is barred unless the claimant commences a proceeding to enforce the claim against the dissolved corporation within 3 years after the publication date of the newspaper notice:\nA. A claimant who was not given written notice under section 1407;\nB. A claimant whose claim was timely sent to the dissolved corporation but not acted on; or\nC. A claimant whose claim is contingent or is based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution.\n13-C M.R.S. \u00a7 1408(3).\n[\u00b6 5] The Godbouts do not dispute that section 1408(3) on its face bars their complaint, which was filed against WLB several months after the close of the three-year repose period. They contend, however, that application of section 1408 to their complaint violates the \u201copen courts\u201d provision of the Maine Constitution because it eliminates their right of redress. To prevail against the presumption that every statute is constitutional, the Godbouts, as the parties challenging the statute, must demonstrate \u201cconvincingly\u201d that the statute and the Constitution conflict. See Irish v. Gimbel, 1997 ME 50, \u00b6 6, 691 A.2d 664, 669. Further, \u201c[a]ll reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the statute.\u201d Id.\n[\u00b6 6] The \u201copen courts\u201d provision of the Maine Constitution states: \u201cEvery person, for an injury inflicted on the person or the person\u2019s reputation, property or immunities, shall have remedy by due course of law; and right and justice shall be administered freely and without sale, completely and without denial, promptly and without delay.\u201d Me. Const, art. I, \u00a7 19. We have interpreted the open courts clause to provide \u201cthat \u2018the courts must be accessible to all persons alike without discrimination, at times and places designated for their sitting, and afford a speedy remedy for every wrong recognized by law as remediable in a court.\u2019 \u201d State v. Bilynsky, 2008 ME 33, \u00b6 6, 942 A.2d 1234, 1236 (quoting Me. Med. Ctr. v. Cote, 577 A.2d 1173, 1176 (Me.1990)).\n[\u00b6 7] The Legislature may, however, \u201cerect reasonable procedural requirements for exercising the right to an adjudication,\u201d including statutes of repose. Irish, 1997 ME 50, \u00b6 16, 691 A.2d at 672. We have stated that \u201cthe power of the legislature to shorten the period of expiration ... has been too often recognized by courts of the highest respectability to be questioned now.\u201d Choroszy v. Tso, 647 A.2d 803, 807 (Me.1994) (quotation marks omitted). Indeed, \u201cMaine law is replete with relatively brief time periods in which a party is required to act or otherwise risk the loss of rights.\u201d Giberson v. Quinn, 445 A.2d 1007, 1009 (Me.1982).\n[\u00b6 8] We have already considered the application of the open courts requirement to statutes of limitations in similar contexts. In Cote, for example, we held that the open courts provision did not prohibit the Legislature from imposing a three-year limitations period on the initiation of medical malpractice claims. 577 A.2d at 1176. In Choroszy, we again concluded that the three-year professional negligence statute of limitations imposed a reasonable time within which plaintiffs were afforded meaningful access to the judicial process, even if the plaintiff reasonably failed to discover the injury within that period. 647 A.2d at 806-07; see Bangor Water Dist. v. Malcolm Pirnie Eng\u2019rs, 534 A.2d 1326, 1328-29 (Me.1988) (discussing the narrow application of a discovery rule in cases involving the existence of a confidential relationship and a \u201cvirtually undiscoverable tort\u201d). Although such statutes may cause \u201csome hardship\u201d to plaintiffs, that hardship is not one of constitutional dimension. Choroszy, 647 A.2d at 807.\n[\u00b6 9] We are also not persuaded by the Godbouts\u2019 contention that the possible availability of insurance proceeds from WLB\u2019s insurer requires a different result. Contrary to the Godbouts\u2019 suggestion, the plain language and legislative history of section 1408, as well as our prior decisions, support the conclusion that this three-year statute of repose was intended to provide an absolute bar to claims against a dissolved corporation, without regard to the availability of remaining insurance proceeds to satisfy a potential claim. See 13-C M.R.S. \u00a7 1408(3); Comm. Amend. A to L.D. 361, No. H-283, Summary (120th Legis. 2001) (stating that the Act is intended to follow the Model Business Corporation Act, with modifications as necessary to incorporate existing Maine practices and procedures); Model Bus. Corp. Act. Ann. \u00a7 14.07 cmt. at 14-66 to 14-67 (4th ed. 2008); Choroszy, 647 A.2d at 806-07; Cote, 577 A.2d at 1176. Furthermore, the Godb-outs provide us with no reason to reconsider the well-established principle that no action for negligence may be brought against a party\u2019s insurer before any judgment is obtained against the insured. Allen v. Pomroy, 277 A.2d 727, 730-31 (Me.1971). To the extent the Godbouts challenge the public policy underlying a three-year repose period against dissolved corporations, that challenge is better addressed to the Legislature. See Harding v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2001 ME 13, \u00b6 15, 765 A.2d 73, 76 (\u201cThe Legislature is the appropriate body for weighing the competing interests at stake.\u201d).\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\n. Although counsel for the Godbouts represented during oral argument that Aubert Godbout has died, no suggestion of death has been filed pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 25(a).\n. The Godbouts also named Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a defendant, but voluntarily dismissed their claims against Metropolitan Life while this appeal was pending.\n.Subsequent amendments to the voluntary dissolution statute do not affect this appeal. See P.L.2007, ch. 231, \u00a7 21; ch. 289, \u00a7 42; ch. 323, \u00a7\u00a7 C-18, C-19.",
