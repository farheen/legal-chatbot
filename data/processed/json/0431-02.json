Whitney objects to the conclu-sory nature of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit and to the manner in which the court computed the amount due under the agreement. Because the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits plus the defendant\u2019s responses to requested admissions preclude any genuine issue of material fact and because the amount due was directly derived from the figures set forth in the agreement, we conclude that Whitney has demonstrated no error entitling it to relief on appeal.\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.",
