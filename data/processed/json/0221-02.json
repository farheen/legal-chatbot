The case was tried before a jury in the Superior Court, and a verdict was rendered in favor of the defendants.\nAfter reviewing the memoranda filed by the parties and after hearing the arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown.\nWe are of the opinion that 1) the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence do not require reversal either individually or cumulatively; 2) the trial judge properly charged the jury with the applicable law (State v. D\u2019Alo, 435 A.2d 317 (R.I.1981), holding that a trial judge may charge the jury in his or her own words as long as the applicable law is stated); and 3) the exclusion of certain medical affidavits was not error in light of this court\u2019s holding in Cuddy v. Schiavonne, 568 A.2d 1387 (R.I.1990).\nFor these reasons, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed. The trial judge\u2019s order denying plaintiffs motion for a new trial is sustained.\nFAY, C.J., did not participate.",
