        "text": "OPINION BY BENDER, J:\n\u00b6 1 Robert L. Hornaman (Appellant) appeals from a judgment of sentence that imposed two consecutive sentences of 6 months\u2019 to 24 months\u2019 incarceration amounting to an aggregate sentence of one to four years\u2019 incarceration. After review of the briefs and record, we affirm.\n\u00b62 The charges arose from a domestic incident in which Appellant argued with the victim striking her in the eye. When the victim attempted to leave the residence, Appellant choked her and held a steak knife to her throat. See Criminal Complaint, Certified Record, No. 1. Appellant, who was originally charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats, unlawful restraint, and possessing instruments of crime, pled to terroristic threats and simple assault.\n\u00b6 3 Appellant was sentenced on August 11, 2006, after a pre-sentence report was prepared and reviewed by the sentencing judge. At the sentencing hearing, Appellant and his attorney spoke, as did the victim, and a witness on Appellant\u2019s behalf. Appellant\u2019s sentence on each count was the minimum standard range sentence called for by the sentencing guidelines.\n\u00b64 Appellant now challenges the sentence raising the following issue:\nDID THE LOWER COURT COMMIT REVERSIBLE ERROR BY HANDING DOWN A MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND CLEARLY UNREA-\nSONABLE SENTENCE BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCORRECT FACTS IN SENTENCING THE DEFENDANT?\nAppellant\u2019s brief at 3.\n\u00b6 5 An appellant who challenges the discretionary aspects of his sentence does not have an appeal as of right. See Commonwealth v. Petaccio, 764 A.2d 582 (Pa.Super.2000). In order for an appellant to challenge the discretionary aspects of his sentence, he must first \u201cset forth in his brief a concise statement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal with respect to the discretionary aspects of a sentence.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f). Second, the appellant must show \u201cthat there is a substantial question that the sentence is not appropriate under the Sentencing Code.\u201d Commonwealth v. Mouzon, 571 Pa. 419, 812 A.2d 617, 621 (2002). See also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9781(b). Moreover, \u201c[w]hether a substantial question has been raised is determined on a case by case basis.\u201d Petaccio, 764 A.2d at 586. Also, \u201cwe will be inclined to allow an appeal where an appellant advances a colorable argument that the trial judge\u2019s actions were: (1) inconsistent with a specific provision of the Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary to the fundamental norms which underlie the sentencing process.\u201d Commonwealth v. Andrews, 720 A.2d 764, 767 (Pa.Super.1998).\n\u00b6 6 We note that Appellant has included in his brief a concise statement of the reasons relied on for allowance of appeal as to the discretionary aspects of his sentence; thus, he has complied with the requirements of Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f).\n\u00b6 7 In his concise statement, Appellant baldly argues that the minimum standard range guideline sentence was \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d and \u201cclearly unreasonable.\u201d The use of those adjectives do not give rise to a substantial question when the sentence in question is at the low end of the standard range. The only fact in Appellant\u2019s 2119(f) statement that in any way relates to Appellant\u2019s case is the court\u2019s reliance on incorrect evidence that was not a part of the record in fashioning the sentence. The \u201cincorrect evidence\u201d referred to by Appellant is that Appellant detained the victim for several hours. Appellant claims there is no evidence of record to support such a claim. Appellant, however, ignores the criminal complaint which specifically states \u201cThe victim states this continued for 2-3 hours.\u201d Criminal Complaint at 2. Appellant also ignores the pre-sentence report that provides the same statement on the second page. Facts which are in the pre-sentence report, which the sentencing court is presumed to review, can be challenged at the time of sentencing. At the time of the sentencing hearing, the Appellant did not challenge the length of the incident when it was stated by the sentencing Judge to be \u201cover a period of several hours.\u201d Sentencing Transcript, 8/11/06 at 12. Appellant cannot now create a substantial factor by denying a fact which he accepted at the time of sentencing.\n\u00b6 8 Appellant fails to articulate in his 2119(b) statement, the manner in which the instant sentence violates a specific provision of the sentencing code or a particular norm underlying the sentencing process. See Mouzon, 812 A.2d at 627; Commonwealth v. Ladamus, 896 A.2d 592, 595 (Pa.Super.2006). Accordingly, review of the merits of Appellant\u2019s challenge to discretionary aspects of his sentence is unwarranted.\n\u00b6 9 Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(1).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2706(a)(1).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2902(a)(1).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(b).",
