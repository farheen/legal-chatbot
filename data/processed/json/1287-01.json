        "text": "OPINION BY\nSenior Judge KELLEY.\nEck Realty Co. (Developer) and the City Council of the City of Williamsport and the City of Williamsport (collectively, City) appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County (trial court) sustaining the appeal of James Van-derlin et al. (Objectors) from the enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849 which amended the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance by rezoning a 3-aere parcel of Developer\u2019s property (subject property) from R-2 (residential) to CC (commercial). We vacate the trial court\u2019s order and dismiss the appeals.\nDeveloper owns a parcel of property in the CC zoning district of the City on which it plans to construct a 14-screen theater complex. The subject property borders this parcel to the east and to the south, and fronts on the south side of West Fourth Street in the City. However, the subject property is located in the City\u2019s R-2 zoning district. Although the parcel in the CC zoning district is sufficient to construct the theater complex, Developer wishes to use the subject property in the R-2 district for parking for the theater complex. To this end, in 1999, Developer submitted a request for a variance to the City\u2019s Zoning Hearing Board (Board) which would permit him to tear down a number of homes on the subject property to construct the parking lot. On September 16, 1999, the Board granted the variance, and Objectors appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the trial court. On January 25, 2000, the trial court issued an opinion and order which sustained the Objectors\u2019 appeal, and reversed the Board\u2019s grant of the variance.\nOn May 11, 2000, the City\u2019s Council approved a land development plan submitted by Developer which included a commercial access-way from West Fourth Avenue and over the subject property to the proposed theater complex. Objectors appealed the Council\u2019s approval to the trial court, arguing that the access-way violated the R-2 zoning of the subject property. On October 11, 2000, the trial court issued an order and opinion sustaining Objectors\u2019 appeal, and reversing the Council\u2019s approval of the land development plan.\nOn May 17, 2000, Developer filed an application to rezone the subject property from R-2 (residential) to CC (commercial) with the Council. A public hearing was held on November 9, 2000, and Objectors appeared and voiced their objections to the rezoning. Following the hearing, the Council voted to deny the application to amend the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance by rezoning the subject property.\nOn March 14, 2001, Developer filed another application to rezone the subject property from R-2 (residential) to CC (commercial). On May 7, 2001, following a public hearing, the City\u2019s Planning Commission voted to approve Developer\u2019s application to rezone the subject property. On June 21, 2001, a public hearing was held before the City\u2019s Council, and Objectors again appeared and voiced their objections to the rezoning. Following the hearing, the Council voted to approve the petition to rezone, and amend the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance, by enacting City Ordinance No. 5849. On July 5, 2001, after public notice and consideration of the Objectors renewed objections, the Council again voted to grant Developer\u2019s petition to rezone the subject property, and enacted City Ordinance No. 5849 amending the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance. Objectors appealed the enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849 to the trial court.\nOn March 20, 2002, without taking additional evidence, the trial court issued an order and opinion reversing the Council\u2019s enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849 rezoning the subject property from R-2 (residential) to CC (commercial). Specifically, the trial court determined that the Council\u2019s enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849, amending the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance, constituted impermissible \u201cspot zoning\u201d. Developer and the City then filed the instant appeals.\nIn these appeals, Developer and the City claim: (1) the trial court erred in determining that the enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849, amending the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance, constituted impermissible \u201cspot zoning\u201d as it is nondiscriminatory; and (2) the trial court erred in determining that the enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849, amending the City\u2019s Zoning Ordinance, constituted impermissible \u201cspot zoning\u201d as it is nonarbitrary and reasonable.\nAlthough all of the parties in these appeals address the merits of the foregoing allegations of error, we will not reach the merits of these claims. Rather, we are compelled to vacate the trial court\u2019s order and dismiss the instant appeals as the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain Objectors\u2019 appeal from the enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849 in the first instance.\nIn this case, it is undisputed that the instant proceedings were initiated by Developer\u2019s application to rezone the subject property. City Council\u2019s enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849, which rezoned the subject property, is a legislative enactment that is not subject to direct judicial review. Section 909.1(b)(5) of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC); East Lampeter Township v. County of Lancaster, 744 A.2d 359 (Pa.Cmwlth.), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 564 Pa. 698, 764 A.2d 51 (2000); Baker; Sharp v. Zoning Hearing Board of the Township of Radnor, 157 Pa.Cmwlth. 50, 628 A.2d 1223, petition for allowance of appeal denied,, 536 Pa. 629, 637 A.2d 290 (1993); Associa,tion of Concerned Citizens of Butler Valley v. Butler Township Board of Supervisors, 135 Pa.Cmwlth. 262, 580 A.2d 470 (1990); Pheasant Run Civic Organization v. Board of Commissioners of Penn Township, 60 Pa.Cmwlth. 216, 430 A.2d 1231 (1981).\nHowever, once the application to rezone was granted, through the enactment of City Ordinance No. 5849, Objectors could have then proceeded with a validity challenge to the ordinance before the City\u2019s Zoning Hearing Board. See Sections 909.1(a)(1), (2) and 916.1(b) of the MPC; Baker, Sharp. In the alternative, Objectors could have challenged the subsequent grant of a zoning permit or an occupancy permit to Developer by filing an appeal with the City\u2019s Zoning Hearing Board. See Section 909.1(a)(3) of the MPC ; East Lampeter Township; Association of Concerned Citizens of Butler Valley. As the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain the Objectors\u2019 appeal in this case, its order must be vacated and the instant appeals dismissed. Association of Concerned Citizens of Butler Valley; Pheasant Run Civic Organization.\nAccordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s order and dismiss the instant appeals.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 30th day of April, 2003, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County, dated March 20, 2002 at No. 01-01232 is VACATED, and the above-captioned appeals are DISMISSED.\n. The subject property is comprised of 16 tracts. Developer has purchased 10 o\u00ed' the tracts, and has made arrangements to purchase the remaining 6 tracts.\n. As the project is presently designed, Developer could obtain parking that is closer to the theater complex by using the subject property for parking. In addition, by moving the parking area into the subject property, Developer could use land in the CC zoning district for restaurants and other commercial uses which would enhance the theater complex and increase its profitability, thereby assisting him in obtaining the necessary financing for the project.\n. Objectors are a group of citizens who reside in the area of the subject property and in other areas of the City.\n. In a letter dated April 24, 2001, the Executive Director of the Lycoming County Planning Commission stated that the Commission could not recommend the approval of the petition as it was inconsistent with the adopted Williamsport Comprehensive Plan.\n. Developer intervened in the proceedings before the trial court.\n. The parties to the proceedings before the trial court stipulated to the contents of the record to be considered by the court.\n. On April 12, 2002, Developer filed a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s order which was lodged at No. 959 C.D.2002. On April 19, 2002, the City filed another notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s order which was lodged at No. 1014 C.D.2002. This Court consolidated the appeals sua sponte by a per curiam order dated July 18, 2002.\n.It is well settled that questions of jurisdiction can never be waived, and they may be raised at any time by the parties or sua sponte by an appellate court. Pennhurst Medical Group v. Department of Public Welfare, 796 A.2d 423 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002).\n. Such an application \u201d[c]alls upon a local governing body, acting in its legislative role, to consider whether rezoning is in the best interest of the community.\u201d Baker v. Chartiers Township, 163 Pa.Cmwlth. 574, 641 A.2d 688, 689, petition for allowance of appeal denied, 539 Pa. 655, 651 A.2d 542 (1994) (citing Fretz v. Hilltown Township Board of Supervisors, 22 Pa.Cmwlth. 276, 348 A.2d 488 (1975)).\n.

Section 909.1(a)(1) and (2) provides, in pertinent part:\n(a) The zoning hearing board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render final adjudications in the following matters:\n(1) Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance, except those brought before the governing body pursuant to sections 609.1 [relating to a landowner\u2019s substantive challenge and curative amendment to an ordinance prohibiting or restricting a use or development of property in which he has an interest,] and 916.1(a)(2) [relating to an appeal from a determination relating to the administration of any flood plain or flood hazard ordinance, or such a provision in a land use ordinance, together with a curative amendment request under section 609.1].\n(2) Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after the effective date of such ordinance\n- 53 P.S. \u00a7 10916.1(b).

Such appeals shall be made in accordance with Article X-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code[, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 11001-A \u2014 11006-A] ...\n. 53 P.S. \u00a7 10909.1(a)(3), Section 909.1(a)(3) provides:\n(a) The zoning hearing board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render final adjudications in the following matters:\n(3) Appeals from the determination of the zoning officer, including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the application therefore, the issuance of any cease and desist order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or lot.\n.
