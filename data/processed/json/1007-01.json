        "text": "FLAHERTY, Judge.\nMountain Protection Alliance (MPA) appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County which granted the motion to quash filed by Amerikohl Mining Company, Inc. (Amerikohl) in response to MPA\u2019s appeal. We affirm.\nThe history of this case is as follows. Amerikohl applied for a special exception to conduct quarrying operations. Eight hearings were conducted before the Fay-ette County Zoning Hearing Board (Board). At its last hearing on October 23, 1996, the Board orally announced its approval of Amerikohl\u2019s application, with several conditions. The Board thereafter failed to issue a written decision within 45 days of the last hearing as is required by Section 908(9) of the Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L, 805, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10908(9).\nOn November 21,1996, 29 days after the last Board hearing, MPA filed an appeal to the trial court, acknowledging that the Board had yet to issue a written decision as required by the MPC, but nonetheless sought to reverse the oral grant of the special exception with conditions. The Board filed an answer. No other activity with regard to this appeal took place for two years.\nOn December 12, 1996, Amerikohl filed an action in mandamus in the trial court asserting a deemed approval of its special exception without conditions. On March 14, 1997, the trial court determined that Amerikohl\u2019s application for a special exception was deemed approved without conditions because the Board failed to render a written decision within 45 days of the last hearing and granted the mandamus. On appeal, this court affirmed, Amerikohl Mining Co. v. Fayette County Zoning Hearing Board (No. 1007 C.D.1997, filed March 19, 1998, Pa.Cmwlth.) and the Supreme Court thereafter denied MPA\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nOn December 21, 1998, MPA filed a pretrial praecipe to place the appeal filed by it on November 21, 1996 on the pre-trial docket. On February 4, 1999 Amerikohl filed a petition to intervene which the trial court granted. On April 12, 1999, Ameri-kohl filed a motion to quash MPA\u2019s November 21, 1996 appeal which the trial court granted finding that there was no written decision from the Board at the time MPA filed its November 21, 1996 appeal. Athough MPA could have chosen to pursue a statutory appeal of the deemed approval, it faded to do so. As such, the trial court determined that it was without jurisdiction to hear MPA\u2019s appeal. This appeal followed.\nThe first issue presented is whether the appeal filed by MPA on November 21, 1996 was premature because it was filed before the entry of a final order. MPA' points out that the merits of a deemed decision can be challenged on appeal. Gryshuk v. Kolb, 685 A.2d 629 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996). Athough we agree with this statement of the law, the -issue is whether MPA filed a timely appeal of the deemed decision thus warranting a review on the merits.\nIn this case, the Board failed to render a written decision within 30 days of its last hearing and when such occurs \u201cthe decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant....\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 10908(9). As such, Amerikohl filed a mandamus action. MPA concedes that the decision of the trial court issuing a writ of mandamus in favor of Amerikohl on March 14, 1997, granting its special exception without conditions was a final ruling. (MPA\u2019s brief at p. 8.) In accordance with 53 P.S. \u00a7 11002-A in the case of a deemed decision, an appeal must be filed within \u201c30 days after the date upon\u2019which notice of said deemed decision is given.... \u201d MPA maintains that because it filed an appeal of the Board\u2019s oral decision granting the special exception with conditions on November 21, 1996, less then 30 days after the rendering of the oral decision, this appeal is sufficient to act as an appeal of the trial court order of March 14, 1997 granting deemed approval of Amerikohl\u2019s special exception without conditions. MPA maintains that it did not file a late appeal but an early one and should not be denied its opportunity to be heard on the merits. We disagree.\nMPA did not have notice of the deemed decision on November 14, when it filed its appeal because such did not occur until December 7, 1996, 45 days after the Board\u2019s last hearing. Thus, the November 21 appeal was premature and did not fall within the 30 day appeal period provided for by 53 P.S. \u00a7 11002-A. Amerikohl maintains that a court lacks jurisdiction to hear a premature appeal just as it lacks jurisdiction to hear a late appeal. Galbreath v. Board of Supervisors of Northampton Township, 55 Pa.Cmwlth. 165, 423 A.2d 45 (1980)(where the lower tribunal has made no final disposition, appellate jurisdiction does not lie.).\nAmerikohl relies on Appeal of Foltz, 22 Pa.Cmwlth. 562, 349 A.2d 918 (1976), wherein a developer filed an appeal from the Board\u2019s decision, which was adverse to him, and issued 46 days after the last hearing. The developer also initiated a mandamus action to compel issuance of the requested permits, as the Board\u2019s decision was not issued within 45 days. This court agreed with developer that the Board\u2019s decision, having been recorded beyond the 45 day limit was deemed favorable to applicant. The developer sought to discontinue his precautionary appeal from the Board\u2019s seemingly adverse ruling, but objectors sought to press developer\u2019s precautionary appeal to obtain further review on the merits. This court stated that the decision in the mandamus action held as a matter of law that the Board\u2019s failure to render a decision within 45 days constituted a favorable decision for the developer. Hence, developer was not aggrieved by the decision of the Board and had no standing to initiate the precautionary appeal. Objectors were trying to breathe life into a moot appeal. Here, Amerikohl argues that MPA\u2019s premature appeal is a nullity; and we agree.\nThe next issue presented is whether the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate procedure, which permit the perfecting of a premature appeal, should be followed in zoning matters.\nAccording to Pa. R.A.P. 301(a) no order of a court shall be appealable until it has been entered upon the appropriate docket in the lower court. However, a notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a determination but before the entry of an appealable order shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof. Pa. R.A.P. 905(a). In Reuter v. Citizens & Northern Bank, 410 Pa.Super. 199, 599 A.2d 673 (1991) a verdict was entered in Bank\u2019s favor on January 26,1990 and Reu-ter\u2019s motion for post-trial relief was dismissed on September 7, 1990. On September 14, 1990 Reuter filed a notice of appeal; however, final judgment was not entered until October 29, 1990. The court treated the premature appeal as being filed \u201cafter and on the day the judgment was entered.\u201d Id. 599 A.2d at 675. Appellate jurisdiction may be perfected after notice of appeal has been filed upon docketing of a final judgment. Id. Here, MPA filed an appeal after the Board\u2019s oral decision. However because the Board failed to issue a timely written decision, Ameri-kohl was awarded a deemed decision. MPA maintains that the deemed decision which granted Amerikohl an unconditional permit perfected MPA\u2019s prior appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to grant Amerikohl a conditional permit.\nWe agree with Amerikohl that MPA\u2019s argument is misplaced as the provisions in the Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure for the reduction of decisions to judgment do not pertain to zoning appeals. Shattuck v. Zoning Hearing Board of Warren County, 93 Pa.Cmwlth. 209, 501 A.2d 319 (1985). The procedure to appeal the decision of a zoning hearing board is set forth in 53 P.S. \u00a7 11001-A which states that \u201c[t]he procedures set forth in this article shall constitute the exclusive method for securing review of any decision .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) This is also not a case where MPA appealed an adjudication awaiting docketing. Rather, MPA filed an appeal before the Board reached a decision. Moreover, we also observe that the deemed decision which granted Amerikohl an unconditional permit could not as MPA argues have perfected MPA\u2019s prior appeal of the Board\u2019s oral decision to grant the permit as that grant by the Board was for a conditional permit. As the appeal of a conditional permit is not the same as an appeal of a unconditional permit, one could not perfect the other.\nFinally, MPA argues that in the interest of judicial economy and speedy resolution this court should permit MPA to pursue its appeal of the deemed decision on the merits.\nMPA, again citing to the Rules of Appellate Procedure maintains that in the interest of just, speedy and inexpensive resolution, the court on its own motion may disregard the requirements of the rules. Pa. R.A.P. 105 and Pa. R.C.P. 126. MPA maintains that it should not have been required to refile its appeal because the trial court had jurisdiction to ignore the MPC\u2019s timelines requirements in favor of judicial economy and hold MPA\u2019s premature appeal perfected.\nHowever, as previously stated the Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure do not have \u201cany application to statutory zoning appeals-\u201d Id 501 A.2d at 322. Such matters are governed exclusively by the MPC.\nAccordingly, as MPA did not file a timely appeal from the deemed approval of Amerikohl\u2019s special exception, the merits of MPA\u2019s appeal are not properly before this court and the order of the trial court quashing MPA\u2019s appeal is affirmed.\nORDER\nNOW, August 10, 2000, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County at No. 2088 of 1996 G.D., dated June 1, 1999, is affirmed.\n. The deemed approval occurred December 7, 1996, 45 days after the Board\u2019s last hearing on October 23, 1996.\n. The lack of a timely Board decision leading to the deemed approval, not the substantive merits of the case, was the sole issue litigated in the mandamus case. A statutory appeal challenges the content of the decision rendered while the mandamus action brought under the statute assaults the inaction of the Board.",

        "text": "KELLEY, Judge,\nconcurring.\nI join in the majority\u2019s decision and write separately to point out how the events, which occurred in this case, have brought about the unfortunate result of the substantive merits in this matter never being addressed by the courts. As set forth by this Court in Amerikohl Mining Co. v. Fayette County Zoning Hearing Board (Pa.Cmwlth., No. 1007 C.D.1997, filed March 19, 1998), after a series of public hearings, the Fayette County Zoning Hearing Board (Board) orally announced its decision on October 23, 1996 approving Amerikohl\u2019s application seeking a special exception with several conditions. A representative of Amerikohl, counsel for Amerikohl, \u00bfis well as members of the press were in attendance. The following day, a newspaper of general circulation reported the Board\u2019s decision.\nOn November 29, 1996, Phyllis Jin, attorney and member of the Board, drafted a written decision granting conditional approval of Amerikohl\u2019s application. On December 2, 1996, the proposed decision was submitted to the Fayette County Office of Planning and Community Development (Planning Office). Pursuant to internal operating procedures, the Planning Office mailed the decision to Board Chair, Ross DiMarco, for his execution and return. DiMarco signed and dated the decision and hand delivered it to the Planning Office during the first week of December 1996. However, the decision was lost and never mailed to Amerikohl or any other party of record. Thus, the first in the series of unfortunate events occurred' \u2014 the decision was lost and a written decision by the Board was not rendered within the required 45 days.\nThereafter, on December 12, 1996, Am-erikohl filed an action in mandamus against the Board in the trial court. Am-erikohl\u2019s complaint requested that the trial court order the Board to issue a written decision approving Anerikohl\u2019s application for special exception without conditions. MPA intervened.\nA non-jury trial was held before the trial court on January 21, 1997, at which time the Board provided Amerikohl with a copy of the Board\u2019s decision that had been redrafted because the Board never located the original decision. By order filed March 18, 1997, the trial court held that Amerikohl\u2019s application was deemed approved without condition due to the Board\u2019s failure to render a written decision within 45 days of the last hearing as required by Section 908(9) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC).\nOn March 31, 1997, MPA filed a motion to reconsider with the trial court, which was opposed by Amerikohl. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration on April 11, 1997. No post trial motions were filed.\nOn April 17, 1997, MPA filed a notice of appeal with this Court and raised the issue of whether the trial court erred in determining that Amerikohl was entitled to deemed approval. However, this Court held that we were precluded from addressing the merits of MPA\u2019s appeal in the absence of a motion for post-trial relief. Hence, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order without reaching the substantive issue of whether the trial court correctly determined that Amerikohl was entitled to deemed approval of its application for special exception without conditions. Thus, another unfortunate event.\nAnother unfortunate event occurred when MPA or another interested party failed to timely appeal the deemed decision as permitted by Section 1002-A of the MPC, 53 P.S. \u00a7 11002-A. Consequently, the opportunity to have the merits of the deemed decision reviewed was lost. And now the majority holds in the current matter before this Court that MPA\u2019s appeal of the Board\u2019s decision must be quashed because MPA\u2019s November 21, 1996 appeal of the Board\u2019s oral decision was premature because it was filed before the entry of a final order. Accordingly, this Court affirms the trial court\u2019s order quashing MPA\u2019s appeal from the Board\u2019s oral decision and holds that since MPA did not file a timely appeal from the deemed approval of Amerikohl\u2019s application for special exception, the merits of MPA\u2019s appeal are not properly before this Court.\nWhile I agree with the majority\u2019s decision, I find it regrettable that the merits have not been reached in this matter due to the sequence of events which occurred starting with the administrative breakdown by the Board and ending with MPA\u2019s failure to follow the procedure set forth in the MPC for appealing a deemed decision. The procedures set forth in the MPC are to protect not only landowners, but also all interested parties and this case is a classic example of what happens when a party fails to take advantage of these protective procedures.\n.
