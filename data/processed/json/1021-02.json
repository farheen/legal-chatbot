The trial justice was correct in holding that there was no basis to reopen and modify a property settlement agreement merely because of a Superior Court judgment requiring payment of four promissory notes that had been in existence and known to the defendant for many years prior to the property settlement agreement.\nConsequently, the defendant\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed. The order of the Family Court declining to reopen and modify the property settlement agreement is affirmed.",
