        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nFollowing a jury trial defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property (11 Del.C. \u00a7 851), possession of a motor vehicle with a removed certification sticker (21 Del.C. \u00a7 6709) and possession of a motor vehicle with knowledge that vehicle identification number is falsified with intent to misrepresent identity (21 Del.C. \u00a7 6705(d)). Those convictions were appealed by defendant who assigns three errors to the proceedings below; viz:\n(1) The Trial Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a hearing to challenge the affidavit supporting the search warrant issued to search the vehicle in question was improper;\n(2) 21 Del.C. \u00a7 6709 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant; and\n(3) 21 Del.C. \u00a7 6705(d) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.\nDefendant raises specific challenges to. paragraphs (A) and (F) of the affidavit and asserts that under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978) (decided after the denial of his request for a suppression hearing) he has a' right to challenge the affidavit. We need not decide whether the rule of Franks requires retroactive application, since we are convinced that even with the challenged, portions of the affidavit excised, it is clear that the affidavit contains sufficient uncontested information to support a finding of probable cause. Franks v. State, Del.Supr., 398 A.2d 783 (1979).\nDefendant\u2019s second challenge is that the motor vehicle statutes under which he was charged and convicted, 21 Del.C. \u00a7 6705(d) and \u00a7 6709, are unconstitutionally vague. The standard for judging the certainty of a criminal statute is whether it is specific enough to give notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of the conduct prohibited. United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 74 S.Ct. 803, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954), State v. J.K., Del.Supr., 383 A.2d 283 (1977).\nDefendant\u2019s argument is without merit as to both of these sections. Section 6705(d) of Title 21 clearly comports with constitutional standards of specificity in that it unambiguously describes both the conduct prohibited and the requisite states of mind.\nDefendant\u2019s claim that 21 Del.C. \u00a7 6709 is so vague as to sweep into its ambit innocent parties is irrelevant, since we must only consider the vagueness challenge in the light of the facts of this case. Wright v. State, Del.Supr., 405 A.2d 685 (1979). In this case (a) the indictment charged that defendant knew of the altered vehicle identification numbers; (b) defendant was in the auto repair business and a former employee of a major automaker, giving rise to a fair inference that he was familiar with confidential vehicle identification numbers; and (c) defendant\u2019s knowledge that the VIN\u2019s had been altered was charged and proven. As applied to the facts of this case and this defendant, \u00a7 6709 is clearly specific enough to give notice of the proscribed conduct and is not unconstitutional.\nAffirmed.",
