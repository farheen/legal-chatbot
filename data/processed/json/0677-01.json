        "text": "STIFTEL, President Judge.\nPlaintiff was arrested and taken into custody by the Delaware State Police during a raid at the Tally Ho restaurant, owned by defendant, Tally Ho, Inc. Plaintiff claimed that he had innocently wandered into a gambling and girlie party. All criminal charges against him by the State were dropped. Plaintiff\u2019s name had appeared in several newspaper stories in connection with the illegal party and police raid. Plaintiff brought suit against Tally Ho for negligence in allowing such a party. He wants damages for lost commissions and injury to his reputation and business standing.\nDefendant Tally Ho requested its insurance carrier, Pennsylvania Manufacturers\u2019 Association Insurance Company (\u201cPMA\u201d), to defend the suit under the terms of its policy. PMA refused; whereupon, Tally Ho joined PMA as a third-party defendant and asked for attorney\u2019s fees to defend Johnston\u2019s suit against it. PMA moved for judgment, summary or on the pleadings.\nPMA\u2019s motion is based on two grounds. First, it argues that the damages complained of in Johnston\u2019s suit against Tally Ho do not fall within the coverage provisions of the insurance policy. Therefore, it claims PMA has no obligation to defend the suit or pay Tally Ho\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Second, PMA argues that Tally Ho failed to give PMA timely notice of Johnston\u2019s suit.\nGenerally, an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend a suit against an insured does not extend to suits based on claims not covered by the policy. 44 Am.Jur.2d, \u201cInsurance\u201d, \u00a7 1535, p. 415; Wilson v. Maryland Casualty Co., 377 Pa. 588, 105 A.2d 304, 50 A.L.R.2d 449. When an insurer bases its refusal to defend on the ground that the action is not covered by the policy, and it appears that the claim for damages against the insured really is outside the policy\u2019s coverage, then such refusal is justified. There is no breach of contract, and the insurer incurs no legal liability. 49 A. L.R.2d, \u201cLiability Insurer \u2014 Refusal to Defend\u201d, \u00a7 4, p. 703; 44 Am.Jur.2d, \u201cInsurance\u201d, \u00a7 1545, p. 425.\nThe controlling question is whether or not the damages claimed by Johnston fall within the coverage provision of the insurance policy. The coverage provision reads as follows:\n\u201cThe company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of\nCoverage A. Bodily injury or\nCoverage B. Property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent . . .\u201d\nIn his complaint, plaintiff requested money for damage to his reputation and business standing. Is this covered by the \u201cproperty damage\u201d clause in the policy?\n\u201cProperty damage is defined in the policy as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property\u201d. Clear and unambiguous words and phrases in insurance policies should be given their ordinary, usual meaning. See Couch On Insurance, \u00a7 15.-71, p. 671. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ctangible property\u201d as \u201cproperty having physical substance apparent to the senses.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, p. 1627 (Rev. 4th Ed.), defines \u201ctangible property\u201d as \u201cthat which may be felt or touched, and is necessarily corporeal . . .\u201d. \u201cProperty damage\u201d is a limiting term, designed to exclude from its province all property that is not tangible. To define it otherwise would not be its usual and ordinary meaning.\nLoss of reputation and business standing is not an \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property\u201d. It may be property in the broad sense of the word, but it is not \u201ctangible property\u201d. Plaintiff\u2019s claim under the property damage provision is not covered by the insurance policy.\nAt oral argument, counsel for Tally Ho suggested that a claim for damages due to bodily injury also is included in the complaint. Plaintiff alleges in his complaint that he was \u201c. . . set upon and arrested\u201d by the police. He does not say any bodily injury resulted. No damages for bodily injury are claimed by him in his complaint. The mere use of the words \u201cset upon and arrested\u201d does not convey the conclusion that plaintiff was physically injured. The complaint, therefore, does not present a claim for bodily injury damage under the policy.\nThe next question is whether PMA has a duty to defend against plaintiff\u2019s suit. The widely accepted rule is that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend an action against an insured is measured by the allegations in plaintiff\u2019s pleadings. If plaintiff\u2019s pleadings state facts bringing the injury within the coverage of the policy, the insurer must defend. 7A Appleman On Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4683, p. 436; Lee v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (D.C.N.Y.1949), 81 F.Supp. 1008, aff\u2019d (2 Cir.), 178 F.2d 750. As seen above, plaintiff has not stated facts in his pleadings that would bring the injury within the coverage of the policy. The duty to defend is limited by the terms of this policy to those suits \u201cseeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage .\u201d. There being no coverage of the damages alleged, there is no duty to defend.\nSince there is no coverage or duty to defend, PMA is not obligated to pay attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Tally Ho in defending plaintiff\u2019s action. United Pacific Ins. Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. (10 Cir., Utah), 185 F.2d 443. PMA has not breached the terms of its contract and has incurred no legal obligation to Tally Ho to defend.\nMy conclusion makes it unnecessary to determine the question of the timeliness of notice of injury to PMA.\nJudgment for defendant Pennsylvania Manufacturers\u2019 Association Insurance Company.\nIt is so ordered.",
