The case involved a real estate broker\u2019s claim for a commission and after a jury waived trial in Superior Court, the trial justice entered judgment for plaintiff. After hearing arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that the trial justice\u2019s decision was based on factual findings and was not clearly wrong. Accordingly the plaintiff\u2019s motion to affirm the Superior Court\u2019s judgment is granted and defendant\u2019s appeal is hereby denied and dismissed.\nDORIS, J., did not participate.",
