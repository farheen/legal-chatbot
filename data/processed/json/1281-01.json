        "text": "HOLLAND, Justice:\nThe defendant, Wayne Jackson, appeals from the Superior Court\u2019s final judgments of conviction on three counts of Burglary in the Second Degree and three counts of Felony Theft. On appeal, Jackson claims that the Superior Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to sever the charges and committed reversible error when it denied his motion to suppress evidence. First, Jackson argues that the Superior Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to sever the offenses, because the separate crimes for which he was indicted were not part of a common scheme or plan as required for joinder by Superior Court Criminal Rule 8(a). Second, Jackson contends that the Superior Court erred when it failed to grant his motion to suppress the evidence seized after his January 20, 2007, arrest. He claims that the arrest was pre-textual and not based on facts that he had committed or was about to commit a crime. He further claims that the police illegally apprehended, detained and searched him in violation of the Delaware and United States Constitutions and that the evidence seized should have been suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d\nWe conclude that the Superior Court properly exercised its discretion in denying the motion to sever the charges because it correctly found that joinder was not prejudicial. We also conclude that the Superior Court properly denied the motion to suppress because the record supports its determination that the evidence was either abandoned or seized incident to a lawful arrest. Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s convictions must be affirmed.\nFacts\nOn September 25, 2006, Thomas Dykes discovered that his home at 2010 North Broom Street in Wilmington had been burglarized. A cordless telephone, laptop computer, digital camera, DVD player, gold bracelet, leather bag, and jar of change were missing. Dykes called the police and Officer Gerald Nagowski of the Wilmington Police Department went to Dykes\u2019 home. The screen of a window in the back of the house had been cut near the latches, making that window the burglar\u2019s likely point of entry. Nagowski dusted the area for fingerprints and recovered two latent prints.\nOn October 10, 2006, Timothy Lewis discovered that his home at 2207 Van Bu-r\u00e9n Place in Wilmington had been burglarized. A cellular telephone, digital camera and one dollar were missing. Lewis called the police and Nagowski went to Lewis\u2019 home. Nagowski identified two adjacent windows in the back of the house where the screens had been cut as the likely point of entry. He dusted the area and recovered one latent fingerprint.\nOn December 20, 2006, Officer Joseph Sammons, supervisor of the Wilmington Police Department\u2019s Evidence Detection and Fingerprint Identification Unit, analyzed the latent prints recovered from the Broom Street and Van Bur\u00e9n Place homes. After comparing them to a known print in the department\u2019s records, Sammons determined that the latent prints from the Broom Street home matched Jackson\u2019s known prints, and that the latent print from the Van Bur\u00e9n Place home compared positively with Jackson\u2019s known print.\nOn January 20, 2007, New Castle County Police Officer Alan Herring made a traffic stop on Polk Drive in Edgemoor around 8 p.m. The driver of the car fled on foot and Herring chased him, but could not catch him. Herring radioed for assistance and broadcast a description of the driver as an African-American male, approximately six feet tall, thin build, medium dark to dark complexion, with facial hair, and wearing a golden-brown \u201cpuffy\u201d coat. A K-9 unit responded to the scene and the police dog tracked the suspect from the abandoned car, south through Edgemoor, and in the direction of Merchants Square Shopping Center on Governor Printz Boulevard, north of the city of Wilmington. Several police officers set up a cordon in the area where the driver was likely to flee. Officer Daniel Guzevieh stationed himself in the Merchants Square Shopping Center.\nAround 8:30 p.m., Guzevieh saw a man riding a bicycle enter the shopping center\u2019s nearly empty parking lot. The man on the bike resembled the suspect described by Herring. Guzevieh described the bicyclist as a tall, thin, African-American man, with facial hair and a dark complexion. The bicyclist was not wearing a \u201cpuffy\u201d coat, but Guzevieh discounted this difference, because the suspect had fled half an hour earlier and had time to change his clothes. Guzevieh decided to question the man and drove toward him.\nWhen the man noticed the police car approaching, he fled immediately. Guze-vich turned on the police car\u2019s emergency lights and followed him. The man crashed his bicycle into the curb, dropped the bag he was carrying and fled on foot. Guze-vich got out of the police car and chased the man on foot, eventually catching up, and physically subduing him and arresting him. The man Guzevieh arrested was later determined to be Wayne Jackson. The man who had abandoned his vehicle on Polk Drive was later determined to be Carr\u00f3n Moon. The abandoned vehicle was registered to Terrance Tonic.\nDuring the search of Jackson incident to his arrest, Guzevich found in Jackson\u2019s pockets an iPod, a Palm Pilot, a photo of a young girl, a University of Delaware class ring, and twenty dollars. In the bag Jackson had dropped, Guzevich found a laptop computer, another iPod, various cords for the iPod and computer, and a shattered glass coin bank with loose change. When Guzevich turned on the computer, it displayed the names of various members of the Callaghan family. The name \u201cEugene F. Callaghan\u201d was also inscribed on the inside of the University of Delaware class ring. The police determined that a Eugene F. Callaghan lived at 191 Brandywine Boulevard, about half a mile from where Jackson was arrested. The police went to the Callaghan residence.\nThe Callaghans were not home when the police arrived, but a neighbor called them and they returned home soon after. Eugene Callaghan identified the various items recovered from Jackson as the Callaghan family\u2019s computer, Eugene Callaghan\u2019s iPod, his daughter\u2019s iPod, the family\u2019s coin bank, and Eugene Callaghan\u2019s class ring. Callaghan also identified the bicycle Jackson was riding as belonging to Callaghan\u2019s son and the photo taken from Jackson\u2019s pocket as a picture of Callaghan\u2019s daughter.\nThe police later compared Jackson\u2019s fingerprints with the fingerprints found at several other homes that had been burglarized in September, October and December 2006. Jackson\u2019s prints matched those taken from four other homes that had been burglarized in North Wilmington.\nProcedural Background\nOn January 25, 2007, Jackson was charged with 34 offenses, including eight counts of Burglary in the Second Degree. Jackson was indicted by a grand jury on February 20, 2007, and was arraigned on March 13, 2007, at which time Jackson\u2019s trial counsel entered an appearance on his behalf.\nOn March 28, 2007, Jackson, pro se, filed a motion to sever his charges. His trial counsel filed a similar motion to sever on May 11, 2007. On June 5, 2007, Jackson\u2019s counsel filed a motion to suppress. A hearing on the motion was held on June 18, 2007. The Superior Court denied the motion to sever on June 29, 2007. A hearing on the motion to suppress was held on August 24, 2007. The Superior Court later denied that motion.\nThe State obtained a new indictment on September 4, 2007, and the case proceeded to trial on October 2, 2007. Before the jury was selected, the State entered a nolle prosequi on the charges relating to the four burglaries in North Wilmington. Following the trial, the jury convicted Jackson of three counts of Burglary in the Second Degree and three counts of Felony Theft, with one of each theft count corresponding to the items stolen from each of the Dykes, Lewis, and Callaghan homes.\nAfter Jackson\u2019s conviction, the State moved to declare him a habitual offender pursuant to title 11, section 4214(a) of the Delaware Code. On February 28, 2008, the Superior Court declared Jackson a habitual offender and sentenced him to twenty-four years imprisonment. Jackson timely appealed.\nBecause Jackson\u2019s appellate counsel concluded that Jackson\u2019s appeal lacked merit, his appellate counsel moved to withdraw under Supreme Court Rule 26(c). After reviewing the record, this Court concluded that \u201cJackson\u2019s appeal is [not] totally devoid of appealable issues\u201d and appointed substitute counsel to prosecute Jackson\u2019s appeal. This is Jackson\u2019s direct appeal of his convictions.\nIssues on Appeal\nJackson raises two arguments in this appeal. First, he claims that the Superior Court abused its discretion in denying his motion to sever, because trying all of the charged offenses in the same proceeding was unfairly prejudicial. Second, he claims that the Superior Court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the police did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop him on the evening he was arrested.\nThe two issues we must consider in this appeal are: first, whether the Superior Court properly exercised its discretion when it denied Jackson\u2019s motion to sever; and second, whether the items were seized incident to a valid arrest, or in the alternative, whether Jackson abandoned the bag so that its recovery does not constitute a search. We will address each argument in turn.\nNo Prejudice From Joinder Motion To Sever Properly Denied\nThe Superior Court denied Jackson\u2019s motion to sever the charges against him, because the court found that prosecuting all of the charges against Jackson in a single proceeding would not result in any unfair prejudice to Jackson. The Superior Court reasoned that \u201c[j]oinder was, and remains, appropriate\u201d because \u201c[t]here is no discernable prejudice or any appearance of prejudice that would run afoul of the applicable rules of evidence or law.\u201d\nWe review the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to sever for abuse of discretion. The trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to sever will be reversed only if the defendant establishes a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the joint trial created \u201csubstantial injustice.\u201d\nIn this appeal, Jackson argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to sever the charges, because there was no evidence of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d linking him to all three burglaries. Jackson asserts that without evidence of a common scheme or plan to support the joinder of his offenses, he was fatally prejudiced because the jury: (1) improperly cumulated the evidence against him; (2) improperly used evidence of one crime to infer a general pattern of criminal behavior or a general criminal disposition; and (3) was confused and therefore unable to follow the evidence introduced. In addition, Jackson argues that the different charges against him required different witnesses and different evidence, and, therefore, any judicial economy by trying the charges together was minimal. Lastly, Jackson implies that the State had no compelling interest to oppose his motion because he faced sentencing as a habitual offender and the possibility of life imprisonment if convicted of any one of the charges. Therefore, he claims, the State \u201cneeded\u201d only one conviction on one charge.\nThe State responds that evidence of each burglary would be admissible at the other trials to establish how and why the police came to suspect Jackson as the burglar. Therefore, the State argues, a joint trial could not have had any prejudicial effect. The State contends that Jackson\u2019s claim of prejudice is hypothetical and that the Superior Court properly rejected it.\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 8(a) permits the joinder of two or more offenses in the same indictment if the offenses are: \u201cof the same or similar character;\u201d or \u201cbased on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d Superior Court Criminal Rule 14 allows the trial court to sever offenses and hold separate trials if it appears that a defendant will be prejudiced by the joinder of offenses. This Court has described the following three types of prejudice to a defendant that will weigh against joinder, namely where:\n(1) the jury may cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered separately, it would not so find;\n(2) the jury may use the evidence of one of the crimes to infer a general criminal disposition of the defendant in order to find guilt of the other crime or crimes; and\n(3) the defendant may be subject to embarrassment or confusion in presenting different and separate defenses to different charges.\nThe rule of joinder is designed to promote judicial economy and efficiency, as long as the defendant\u2019s rights are not compromised. To determine whether the joinder of offenses is proper, Superior Court Criminal Rules 8 and 14 must be read together. Such a determination involves a two-part inquiry: First, were the charges properly joined under Rule 8(a)? Second, should the offenses have been severed as prejudicial under Rule 14? Accordingly, Jackson must establish that a violation of either Rule 8 or 14 occurred, and then must establish a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the joint trial created \u201csubstantial injustice.\u201d A hypothetical assertion of prejudice is not enough to meet the defendant\u2019s burden. If the defendant makes an unsubstantiated claim of prejudice, the defendant\u2019s interests are outweighed by the interest of judicial economy.\nJackson asserts that there was \u201cno common scheme or plan\u201d connecting the offenses with which he was charged. Rule 8(a) provides that joinder is proper if the \u201coffenses charged are of the same or similar character.\u201d The record reflects that the charges against Jackson arose from a series of residential burglaries that were, indisputably, of the same or similar character. Therefore, the State could have joined the charges against Jackson.\nWe next consider whether joinder would have created sufficient prejudice that the Superior Court should have severed the charges. Although Jackson recites the factors for determining prejudice under Wiest v. State, he has not articulated any specific reasons why joinder of the offenses caused him prejudice. The record does not reflect any specific prejudice to Jackson either. Where a defendant fails to show actual prejudice, this Court will not find an abuse of discretion based on \u201cmere hypothetical prejudice.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting joinder of the charges.\nJackson\u2019s final contention is that the State did not have a legitimate interest in judicial economy, because any one conviction would qualify him for a life sentence as a habitual offender. Judicial economy is a factor that the trial court may consider when deciding a motion to sever, provided that the defendant\u2019s rights are safeguarded. Because Jackson has not shown any prejudice from the joinder of his offenses, we need not address whether the State had a \u201clegitimate\u201d interest in maximizing judicial economy in this case.\nArrest and Search Valid Motion to Suppress Properly Denied\nThe Superior Court denied Jackson\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence, ruling that the evidence the police recovered had been either abandoned by Jackson or seized incident to his lawful arrest. The court explained its reasoning in denying the motion to suppress as follows:\n[The search] is reasonable. It is within a relatively close period of time from the original confrontation in the direction that the search was pushing \u2014 at least the police hoped \u2014 pushing the individual involved in the contact with Officer Herring. The items in question were either found on the defendant or he was observed discarding the same. They were secured incident to a lawful arrest and inventoried as well. And promptly identified as being contraband from the Brandywine [Boulevard home]....\nI will conclude, find or rule that [the bag] is abandoned property in the first instance, but even if it isn\u2019t, it was taken incident to a lawful arrest. It would have to be. It was dropped, [the defendant] ran across the street, [the] defendant [was] arrested, [then the] bag [was] picked up. It was part of the contraband. Either way or alternatively, I think the motion to suppress goes out. It should be denied as well as to the items that were found on his person.\nWe review the Superior Court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress for abuse of discretion. We examine the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo for errors in formulating or applying legal precepts. We will uphold the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are not supported by sufficient evidence and are clearly erroneous.\nJackson claims that his arrest and search were illegal and that the evidence obtained during the illegal arrest and search is \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d that should have been excluded. He asserts that the police lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop him because he was not engaged in any criminal conduct at the time. He argues that he was merely \u201criding a bicycle through a parking lot at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night and happened to be a thin, black man with facial hair.\u201d Although he recognizes that the police were searching for a suspect described as a \u201cblack male, thin, six feet tall, dark complexion and with facial hair,\u201d Jackson contends that the suspect had been wearing \u201ca puffy jacket, golden brown in color\u201d and was identified as Cor-ron Moon. Jackson argues that \u201c[h]is jacket did not match that worn by [the] original suspect, Moon.\u201d Therefore, he claims, his apprehension, detention and search violated the Delaware and United States Constitutions. However, he cites no authority for either contention.\nIn Ortiz v. State, we held that \u201cconclusory assertions that the Delaware Constitution has been violated will be considered to be waived on appeal.\u201d Accordingly, if an alleged violation of the Delaware Constitution is not fully and fairly presented to this Court, it will not be addressed on appeal. Jackson\u2019s brief makes only a general reference to \u201cthe law of search and seizure\u201d and his motion to suppress mentions only that he sought that \u201call evidence ... be suppressed as a result of his illegal arrest in violation of his federal and state constitutional protections.\u201d He cites no relevant constitutional provisions in his motion to suppress and cites no case law in his brief. Accordingly, Jackson has waived any claim that the evidence was seized in violation of the Delaware Constitution. We will consider only his claims under the United States Constitution.\nWe conclude that Jackson also has failed to assert a violation of the United States Constitution. With regard to the bicycle and bag Jackson discarded pri- or to his detention by Officer Guzevich, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection had not yet attached. The Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection from unlawful searches and seizures does not attach until an officer applies physical force to the suspect or the suspect submits to an officer\u2019s show of authority. In this case, Jackson was not seized until he was physically subdued by Officer Guzevich following the foot chase. Property discarded by a suspect who refuses to submit to an officer\u2019s authority and flees is deemed abandoned.\nThere is no legal basis under the Fourth Amendment to suppress that abandoned property. Therefore, the Superior Court properly denied the motion to suppress the bag Jackson threw away and the bicycle he left behind as he fled from the police. Under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Jackson was seized when he submitted to Officer Guze-vich\u2019s show of authority, ie., when he was physically subdued. He discarded the bag and bicycle before his seizure. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the motion for suppression of the bag and bicycle because they were abandoned and not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\nWith regard to the items recovered from Jackson\u2019s person after his arrest, we conclude that the police had probable cause to arrest Jackson and lawfully seized those items incident to Jackson\u2019s arrest. The Superior Court ruled that those items \u2014 the iPod, palm pilot, class ring, photo, and twenty dollars \u2014 were lawfully seized incident to Jackson\u2019s arrest. The State did not address the seizure of those items. Whether suppression was properly denied depends on whether the arrest was lawful. Therefore, we must consider whether the police had probable cause to arrest Jackson.\nWhether there was probable cause to arrest a defendant is determined under a totality of the circumstances test. Jackson argues that the police had no reason to stop him and implies that the police stopped him solely on the basis of race. Although a stop based solely on race is impermissible under the Fourth Amendment, the \u201cuse of race may be legitimate when it is one among several factors suggestive of criminality.\u201d\nJackson matched the description of the suspect given by Officer Herring. That description contained one racial element, but the other, racially neutral circumstances surrounding Jackson\u2019s arrest were amply sufficient to establish probable cause. Jackson was in a nearly deserted shopping center, in an area the police had cordoned off, shortly after a suspect of similar appearance had fled from Officer Herring. In addition, Jackson fled from Officer Guzevich immediately upon seeing the police car and discarded the bag he was carrying. Having considered the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the record reflects that the police had probable cause to lawfully arrest Jackson. Accordingly, the Superior Court properly denied the motion for suppression of the items the police discovered on Jackson\u2019s person during their search incident to his lawful arrest.\nConclusion\nThe judgments of the Superior Court are affirmed.\n.
