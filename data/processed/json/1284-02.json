Bar R. XI \u00a7 14(g), it is\nORDERED that David E. Parker, Esquire, is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for a period of five years with a fitness requirement.

It is\nFURTHER ORDERED that for purposes of reinstatement respondent\u2019s suspension will not begin to run until such time as he files an affidavit that fully complies with the requirements of D.C.Bar. R. XI \u00a7 14(g).",
