        "text": "OPINION\nPer Curiam:\nIn this appeal, we clarify that when an employer asserts that a former employee\u2019s misconduct disqualifies her from receiving unemployment benefits, the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that the employee\u2019s discharge was due to disqualifying misconduct. The employer may do this by making an initial showing of willful misconduct, related to the employment. To avoid being disqualified from receiving benefits, the former employee must then demonstrate that the nature of the misconduct was not of the type for which disqualification is warranted.\nIn this case, the administrative agency failed to appropriately determine whether the employer had met its burden to show that its former employee was discharged for willful misconduct with regard to her unauthorized absences. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order denying judicial review of the administrative decision awarding unemployment compensation, and we remand this matter to the district court with instructions that it, in turn, remand the matter to the administrative agency for further proceedings with regard to this issue.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nRespondent Harriet Bundley was discharged from her position with appellant Clark County School District as an \u201cin-house suspension\u2019 \u2019 teacher. According to the termination notice, Bundley was discharged for several general reasons and, specifically, for being \u201cabsent without leave\u201d on eight occasions \u2014 January 18, 19, and 20, 2005, and February 9, 10, 17, 18, and 24, 2005 \u2014 for a total of seven full days, despite having previously received relevant admonishments.\nThereafter, Bundley filed for unemployment benefits, which she was granted by respondent Employment Security Division of the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation. The school district challenged Bundley\u2019s right to receive those benefits, however, alleging that Bundley was discharged for misconduct in connection with her work. Specifically, the school district indicated that Bundley had \u201cexcessive attendance\u201d problems, of which she had been warned could lead to job loss.\nBefore and at the subsequent administrative hearing, the school district submitted as evidence four written admonishments that Bundley had received in the fall of 2004, reminding her that she (1) had been absent five days since the beginning of the school year, and late once; (2) had in some instances notified the wrong person of her absences, and was instead required to report any absences to, and obtain approval therefor from, the principal or assistant principal; and (3) had, apparently before May 26, 2004, experienced some problems with excessive absences and/or absences taken before a sufficient amount of leave had accrued. While the school\u2019s principal stated, during the hearing, that Bundley had been discharged for attendance problems, her testimony focused on one precipitating factor: Bundley\u2019s alleged failure to report her absences on February 17, 18, and 24, 2005. With regard to this issue, the principal relayed that neither herself, nor the assistant principal or school secretaries, recalled Bundley having called in on those three days.\nBundley, on the other hand, testified that she had called in to report those absences and had spoken once to the assistant principal and twice to the principal. She also testified that she was absent because she had to see a doctor about her broken foot and, on February 24th, to take care of her ill daughter, whose illness was apparently the result of a continuing medical condition of which the school was aware. Bundley averred that she had applied, or had planned to apply, for additional sick leave from the school\u2019s sick leave bank. Finally, she indicated that she was willing to submit documentation to support her claims as to having called the school on the days in question, broken her foot, and-applied for leave from the sick leave bank.\nAfter the hearing concluded, an appeals referee determined that the school principal\u2019s assertions that Bundley had not phoned to report her absences were more credible. The appeals referee thus concluded that Bundley was discharged because of attendance problems and her failure to notify her employer that she would be absent on February 17, 18, and 24, in contravention of the school\u2019s policy. According to the appeals referee, Bundley\u2019s failure to notify her employer of her inability to report to work on those three days constituted misconduct disqualifying her from receiving benefits under NRS 612.385, which provides that an employee who is discharged for work-related misconduct may not receive benefits. Bundley administratively appealed.\nAfter reviewing the evidence that had been presented to the appeals referee, the Board of Review reversed the appeals referee\u2019s decision, determining that Bundley had credibly testified that her absence on the days in question was due to her and her daughter\u2019s illnesses and that she had timely notified her supervisor of those absences. Noting that Bundley was admittedly absent without leave but that nothing appeared in the record to show that Bundley had failed to report her absences, the Board concluded that, for unemployment benefits purposes, mere absence resulting from illness is not disqualifying misconduct.\nThe school district\u2019s subsequent petition for judicial review was denied, and consequently, it appeals.\nDISCUSSION\nWhen reviewing an administrative unemployment compensation decision, this court, like the district court, examines the evidence in the administrative record to ascertain whether the Board acted arbitrarily or capriciously, thereby abusing its discretion. With regard to the Board\u2019s factual determinations, we note that the Board conducts de novo review of appeals referee decisions. Therefore, when considering the administrative record, the Board acts as \u201can independent trier of fact,\u201d and the Board\u2019s factual findings, when supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.\nAccordingly, we generally review the Board\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence, which is evidence that a reasonable mind could find adequately upholds a conclusion. In no case may we substitute our judgment for that of the Board as to the weight of the evidence. Thus, even though we review de novo any questions purely of law, the Board\u2019s fact-based legal conclusions with regard to whether a person is entitled to unemployment compensation are entitled to deference.\nDisqualifying misconduct carries an element of wrongfulness\nWe have recognized that the protective purpose behind Nevada\u2019s unemployment compensation system is to provide \u201ctemporary assistance and economic security to individuals who become involuntarily unemployed.\u201d To further this purpose, the unemployment compensation law, NRS Chapter 612, presumes that an employee is covered by the system and does not allow the employee to waive his or her rights under the system. Because the system is not designed to provide assistance to those persons who are deemed to have become voluntarily unemployed, however, NRS 612.385 disqualifies a person from receiving unemployment benefits \u201cif [she] was discharged from . . . employment for misconduct connected with [her] work.\u201d\nDisqualifying misconduct occurs when an employee deliberately and unjustifiably violates or disregards her employer\u2019s reasonable policy or standard, or otherwise acts in such a careless or negligent manner as to \u201c \u2018show a substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interests or the employee\u2019s duties and obligations to [her] employer.\u2019 \u201d As we have previously suggested, because disqualifying misconduct must involve an \u201celement of wrongfulness,\u201d an employee\u2019s termination, even if based on misconduct, does not necessarily require disqualification under the unemployment compensation law. Instead, determining whether misconduct disqualifies a person from receiving unemployment benefits \u201crequires a separate and distinct analysis\u201d: \u201c[w]hen analyzing the concept of misconduct, the trier of fact must consider the legal definition [of disqualifying misconduct] in context with the factual circumstances surrounding the conduct at issue.\u201d Generally, then, an employee\u2019s absence will constitute misconduct for unemployment compensation purposes only if the circumstances indicate that the absence was taken in willful violation or disregard of a reasonable employment policy (i.e., was unjustified and, if appropriate, unapproved), or lacked the appropriate accompanying notice.\nAs the determination of whether Bundley\u2019s acts constituted misconduct is, thus, a fact-based question of law, the Board\u2019s decision is entitled to deference. Nevertheless, the school district essentially argues that the Board overlooked two ways in which Bundley engaged in disqualifying misconduct: (1) she was admittedly absent eight times without available leave, and she failed to submit evidence documenting that her absences were justified or approved, or that she had even applied for additional leave; and (2) she failed to demonstrate that she had timely notified the school that she would be absent on February 17, 18, and 24, despite being aware of the school\u2019s policy that she do so.\nThe employer bears the burden of demonstrating disqualifying misconduct\nPreliminarily, we note that both of the school district\u2019s arguments arise from the same flawed premise \u2014 that Bundley was responsible for demonstrating that her absences did not constitute misconduct. Bundley, however, did not bear the burden to demonstrate that she had not committed disqualifying misconduct. Instead, the school district carried the burden to show that Bund-ley had engaged in conduct disqualifying her from receiving unemployment benefits under NRS 612.385.\nAs several other jurisdictions have noted in similar contexts, the discharged employee is not always aware of the circumstances surrounding her dismissal, but rather, the employer is in the \u201c \u2018unique position to know the reasons for [the] employee\u2019s discharge.\u2019\u201d Further, \u2018\u201caccess to the facts relating to that discharge will be more readily obtained by the employer than the employee.\u2019 \u201d The practical result is that the employer can usually more easily prove employee misconduct than the employee can disprove the employer\u2019s assertion that she engaged in such misconduct.\nFor these reasons, and in light of the unemployment compensation system\u2019s protective purposes, as described above, we conclude that in Nevada, if an employer asserts that a former employee is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because that employee was discharged due to misconduct, the employer bears the burden of so proving by a preponderance of the evidence. Once the employer makes an initial showing of willful misconduct, however, the burden shifts to the former employee to demonstrate that the conduct cannot be characterized as misconduct within the meaning of NRS 612.385, for example, by explaining the conduct and showing that it was reasonable and justified under the circumstances.\nMere absence without leave is not disqualifying misconduct, but an employer may meet its initial burden by demonstrating excessive unauthorized absences\nThe school district asserts that, because the Board recognized that absence without leave is misconduct leading to termination, it necessarily erred when it determined that no disqualifying misconduct occurred. But, as noted above, whether Bundley\u2019s absences disqualified her from receiving unemployment benefits requires a separate analysis in light of the definition of misconduct pertaining to the unemployment compensation law \u2014 Bundley\u2019s conduct must have been in willful violation or disregard of the school\u2019s standards.\nIn this vein, the school district argues that Bundley\u2019s seven days of absences were unauthorized and in direct contravention of school policy and prior school directives. With respect to the latter assertion, that Bundley\u2019s absences violated school policy and directives, the record does not contain the school district\u2019s absence policy, and the directives merely order Bundley to \u201c[c]ome to work as assigned,\u201d indicating that, in the past, she had improperly used leave that had not yet accrued and had not contacted the right person to report her absences. Accordingly, it is not clear that Bund-ley\u2019s 2005 absences violated any policy or directive.\nMoreover, even if Bundley\u2019s absences were in violation of school policy, the school district submitted no evidence to contradict Bundley\u2019s testimony as to the reasons for the three absences discussed during the hearing, which the Board concluded showed that the absences were justified. The school district failed to contradict this testimony even though it acknowledged that, at the time she was discharged, Bundley had informed the school authorities that at least some of the absences were the result of her daughter\u2019s illness. Accordingly, the school district failed to show that Bundley, whom the law presumes is an employee covered by the system, deliberately and unjustifiably violated any school absence policy, and the Board\u2019s decision with regard to the alleged policy violations is based on substantial evidence.\nWith respect to the school district\u2019s former assertion, that Bundley was absent without authorization eight times within approximately one month, however, it is unclear whether the school district met its initial burden. As recognized by the Supreme Court of Florida, when an employee is absent without authorization, that conduct is inherently detrimental to the employer\u2019s interests in efficiently operating its business. And if the unauthorized absences are many, their excessiveness tends to show a willful disregard of such interests. Accordingly, if an employer shows a clear pattern of unauthorized absenteeism, a presumption of willful misconduct arises, which can be rebutted only if the former employee shows that the absences did not constitute misconduct within the meaning of NRS 612.385.\nHere, the Board failed to consider whether Bundley\u2019s admitted-to unauthorized absences were excessive, and thus whether the school district met its initial burden to prove willful misconduct. Further, although Bundley then testified that as to the nonvoluntary nature of the three absences on which the school district based its arguments during the administrative hearing, it is unclear whether the other five absences in 2005 were justifiable, as they were not discussed during the administrative hearing. Since neither the appeals referee nor the Board adequately considered this issue, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand this matter with instructions that the court remand the matter to the Board for further proceedings with respect to this issue.\nWhen conflicting testimony exists, misconduct is not necessarily demonstrated by an alleged failure to report absences\nRegarding the allegation that Bundley failed to notify the school district of her last three absences, we recognize that even if Bundley\u2019s absences themselves do not constitute misconduct, any unreasonable failure on her part to notify the school that she was going to be absent could show a substantial disregard of her employer\u2019s interests so as to disqualify her from receiving unemployment benefits under NRS 612.385. The school district, however, did not show that Bundley failed to timely report her absences. Although the school\u2019s principal initially testified that Bundley had not called in on February 17, 18, and 24, she later testified that she could not recall whether Bundley had called, and that neither the assistant principal nor the school secretaries could remember any calls from Bundley on those days, either. Bundley, on the other hand, insisted that she had telephoned on each of the three days in question and had spoken once with the assistant principal and twice with the principal. Accordingly, as the Board was free to rely on Bundley\u2019s testimony, its determination that Bundley is not disqualified due to any failure to notify her employer is entitled to deference.\nCONCLUSION\nAs the employer challenging its former employee\u2019s right to receive unemployment benefits, under NRS 612.385\u2019s disqualification for misconduct provision, the school district bore the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bund-ley committed the alleged misconduct. As the school district did not show that Bundley engaged in misconduct disqualifying her from receiving unemployment benefits with regard to school policy and directive violations or with respect to non-notification, the Board\u2019s determination that Bundley was not disqualified from receiving benefits on these grounds is based on substantial evidence and is thus entitled to deference. Because the appeals referee and the Board failed to adequately consider the school district\u2019s assertion that disqualification was warranted based on Bundley\u2019s excessive unauthorized absences, however, we reverse the district court\u2019s order denying judicial review, and we remand this matter to the district court so that it may remand the matter to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nState, Emp.

For example, in the underlying matter, Bundley\u2019s termination notice indicated that she was discharged for being absent without leave. The hearing notice stated merely that the issue to be decided was whether Bundley was discharged for misconduct. Accordingly, Bundley was not fully aware that the school district would assert that her alleged failures to notify the school of her absences on February 17, 18, and 24 were causes for her discharge. We note, too, that NRS 233B.121(2)(d) requires the hearing notice to include \u201c[a] short and plain statement of the matters asserted\u201d and provides that, if the notice merely states the relevant issues, a party may obtain by request \u201ca more definite and detailed statement.\u201d See also NAC 612.225(3) (limiting the hearing\u2019s scope \u201cto issues identified in the notice of hearing, unless the parties are provided with proper notice and the opportunity to request a continuance with respect to other issues\u201d).\nBean, 965 P.2d at 261.\nSee Dalton Brick & Tile Company v.

Load King Mfg. Co., 758 So. 2d 649, 654 (Fla. 2000); Cargal v. Review Bd. of Ind. Empl. Sec. Div., 428 N.E.2d 85, 87 (Ind. Ct. App. 1981); Kelly v. Unemploy. Comp.

Ct. App. 1989).\nBundley, when testifying before the appeals referee, indicated that the school\u2019s policy was to allow up to five consecutive days\u2019 absence before any action to discharge the employee was taken, which did not occur here.\nSee Croy v. Division of Employment Security, 187 S.W.3d 888, 893 (Mo. Ct. App. 2006) (recognizing that absences due to illness or emergency are generally not considered willful misconduct, especially when reported, and that when the employer fails to provide evidence of its relevant policies and the alleged misconduct, including whether any claimed illness existed, no disqualification is warranted); Randolph M. James, P.C. v. Lemmons, 629 S.E.2d 324, 332 (N.C. Ct. App. 2006) (noting that an employee has little control over absences caused by illness, so that disqualification may not be warranted therefor). We note that the record contains no indication that the school district even requested documentation as to Bundley\u2019s or her daughter\u2019s illnesses and doctor\u2019s appointments. See generally NAC 612.225(2) (providing that, upon showing necessity, a party may obtain a subpoena).\nSee Wright v. State, Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 121 Nev. 122, 125, 110 P.3d 1066, 1068 (2005) (recognizing that substantial evidence can be \u201c \u2018inferentially shown by [a] lack of [certain] evidence\u2019 \u201d (quoting City of Reno v. Estate of Wells, 110 Nev. 1218, 1222, 885 P.2d 545, 548 (1994))).\nMason, 758 So. 2d at 653.\nId. at 654 (noting that, before the burden will be shifted to the former employee, the employer must present \u201csatisfactory proof... of a serious and identifiable pattern of excessive absenteeism\u201d); id. at 656 (pointing out that the employer\u2019s burden of proving excessive unauthorized absenteeism is a \u201cheavy\u201d one).\nWe note that Bundley submitted evidence showing that she joined the sick leave bank the following school year, and she indicated that she thought that she would be able to obtain additional leave therefrom to cover her January and February 2005 absences. In reviewing this issue on remand, these assertions should also be considered in determining whether the school district met its burden.\nSee, e.g., id. at 655-56 (concluding that the employer\u2019s proof that the former employee had four absences, four late arrivals, and one early quitting time was sufficient to show willful misconduct, but discussing, with approval, the trial court\u2019s conclusion in Blumetti v. Unemployment Appeals Com\u2019n, 675 So. 2d 689, 691 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998), that the employer failed to meet its initial burden of showing excessive absenteeism when some of the absences relied upon where not shown to be the former employee\u2019s fault); see also Tallahassee Primary Care v. Florida UAC, 930 So. 2d 824 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (concluding that the employer presented competent evidence of excessive and unauthorized absences, but that the former employee had rebutted the presumption of misconduct arising therefrom by showing that her absences were due, among other things, to her sick child).\nKraft, 102 Nev. at 194, 717 P.2d at 585.\nThe school district also argues that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because, even though it considered no additional evidence, it came to the opposite credibility determinations as did the appeals referee, without any grounds on which to do so. See Reno v. Estate of Wells, 110 Nev. 1218, 1222, 885 P.2d 545, 548 (1994) (recognizing that \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d have been defined, in the governmental action context, as \u201c \u2018an apparent absence of any grounds or reasons for the decision\u2019 \u201d (quoting Tighe v. Von Goerken, 108 Nev. 440, 442-43, 833 P.2d 1135, 1136 (1992))). As noted above, however, the Board is free, during its de novo review, to review the evidence without deferring to the appeals referee\u2019s conclusions. Further, the Board\u2019s decision to afford the school\u2019s principal\u2019s testimony less weight was not unreasonable; although Bundley asserted that she had phoned the school to report her absences, the principal merely could not recall whether she had received any calls, and the school district did not provide any additional evidence demonstrating that Bundley did not call. See, e.g., Hilton Hotels, 102 Nev. at 609, 729 P.2d at 499 (noting that the Board was free to assign probative values to testimony adduced during a hearing).",
