      {
        "text": "RUIZ, Associate Judge:\nThis case arises out of a plan to convert, by partially demolishing and adding new construction to, the former Italian Embassy (\u201cthe property\u201d), which is owned by petitioner, Embassy Real Estate Holdings, LLC, into condominium residences. After petitioner\u2019s construction team had applied for pre-construction and construction permits, the Historic Preservation Office (\u201cHPO\u201d) applied to designate the property an historic landmark under the Historic Landmark and Historic Protection Act of 1978 (\u201cthe Act\u201d). See D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1101 et seq. (2001). The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (\u201cDCRA\u201d) issued some of the requested permits before the Historic Preservation Review Board (\u201cHPRB\u201d) completed its review of the designation application, which ultimately resulted in designation of the property as an historic landmark. As a result, the HPRB determined, the construction permits had been issued in error by DCRA, because the development that petitioner proposed for the property was inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Petitioner appealed to the Mayor\u2019s Agent for Historic Preservation (\u201cMayor\u2019s Agent\u201d), who affirmed HPRB\u2019s determination that issuance of the permits was inconsistent with the property\u2019s designation as an historic landmark.\nBefore this court, petitioner challenges the decision of the Mayor\u2019s Agent on various grounds: that the permit applications are not subject to review under the Act because they were filed before the landmark designation, and, therefore, HPRB and the Mayor\u2019s Agent acted without jurisdiction; that the doctrines of estoppel and laches preclude application of the Act to the permit applications; that, even assuming that the Act applies, the Mayor\u2019s Agent acted arbitrarily and without substantial evidence in determining that the permits did not meet the Act\u2019s requirement that they be \u201cnecessary in the public interest;\u201d and that the Mayor\u2019s Agent applied the wrong standard and ignored undisputed evidence in determining that denial of the permits did not constitute \u201cunreasonable economic hardship\u201d amounting to an unconstitutional taking. We disagree with petitioner\u2019s contentions and affirm the decision of the Mayor\u2019s Agent as consistent with applicable legal principles and supported by substantial evidence of record.\nI.\nBACKGROUND\nThe property is a free-standing urban mansion, located at 2700 16th Street and 1651 Fuller Street, N.W., which consists of a main building containing the former Italian ambassador\u2019s residence, a chancery wing, and a courtyard. It is designed in Italian Renaissance Revival Style and \u201cis a primary and integral component of the boulevard of distinguished buildings that line 16th Street on Meridian Hill.\u201d The buildings and grounds are described in the HPRB\u2019s landmark designation:\nThe three-story hip-roofed main block contains the original ambassador\u2019s residence, with one-story flat-roofed wings enclosing three sides of an open-air courtyard at the rear. The fourth side of the court is formed by the side of the original chancery wing, originally a long two-story hip-roofed block with its short end facing onto Puller Street. A circa 1930s addition extends the original chancery in a similar two-story configuration along Puller Street, creating an L-Shaped footprint overall. The embassy is faced in limestone with a terra cotta tile roof and sculptural embellishment concentrated at window and door surrounds; the simpler chancery is stucco with limestone trim and tile roofs.\nIn 2001, Bruce Bradley purchased the property, planning to either sell it for continued use as an embassy or develop it as a residential property. He sought the advice of an architectural design team, Shalom Baranes and Patrick Burkhart. Mr. Baranes advised that, although the property was not in an historic district or designated as an historic landmark, it was \u201cclearly eligible for designation,\u201d and that, \u201cshould anyone file a designation application, it was our opinion that application would succeed.\u201d\nTo address this possibility, Mr. Baranes presented Mr. Bradley with two options. Under one option, Mr. Bradley would apply for the designation landmark and \u201cthen subject the whole property to the normal HPRB review,\u201d a course that would definitively establish whether the property would be designated an historic landmark and its development subject to review and, possibly, restrictions under the Act. The other option \u2014 which Mr. Baranes told Mr. Bradley would involve \u201csome risk\u201d \u2014 consisted of negotiating a private agreement with members of the preservation community most likely to file an application to designate the property as historic. Under such an agreement, the property owner typically offers certain concessions in the development plan in exchange for a promise not to file for historic designation of the property. Mr. Baranes explained that this option would be successful in \u201ca situation where there was no other interested party in proceeding with a designation.\u201d\nMr. Bradley\u2019s design team members testified that they first met with State [ie., D.C.] Historic Preservation Officer David Maloney to discuss the project in the fall of 2001. At the time, the plan for the property was to construct high-end condominium units in rooftop additions to the existing buildings. Mr. Maloney testified that, although he could not recall this meeting or design plan, the discussion might have been \u201ctacked onto\u201d an October 2001 meeting regarding a different project.\nAccording to Mr. Baranes, Mr. Maloney told the design team that the HPO had \u201cno intent at the time\u201d to file an application to designate the property as an historic landmark, but the team did not ask for an \u201cabsolute assurance that [the HPO] would never file a designation application;\u201d Mr. Burkhart testified that he left this meeting with the understanding that, although Mr. Maloney did not intend to file a landmark application on behalf of the HPO, some community groups might do so, and that they should contact these groups. While Mr. Maloney agreed that he likely told the design team to contact community organizations, he testified that he was \u201c100 percent certain\u201d that he had not suggested that they enter into private agreements with these groups in an effort to bypass formal HPRB review under the Act.\nIn the economic aftermath of September 11, 2001, plans to renovate the property were put on hold. In the spring of 2004, Mr. Bradley brought new investors into the project and created the petitioner, Embassy Real Estate Holdings, LLC. In August 2004, the design team met again with Mr. Maloney of the HPO, to discuss a different plan to renovate the property. This time, Mr. Maloney raised concerns about the negative impact that the new design, which included a ninety-foot tower, would have on existing views and the courtyard, as well as the significant demolition required for its construction. Mr. Burkhart testified that, notwithstanding these concerns, he left that meeting as well with the understanding that the \u201cHPO had no plans to designate the building.\u201d\nPetitioner had no further contact with the HPO regarding the project. On January 24, 2006, petitioner entered into an agreement with the D.C. Preservation League (\u201cDCPL\u201d), a private group dedicated to preserving and enhancing historic properties in the District of Columbia, in which certain changes were made to the design of the proposed renovation, and petitioner agreed to preserve some of the historic interior features of the property-the latter being matters beyond the protection of the Act. In exchange, DCPL agreed not to file for a landmark designation. Petitioner\u2019s negotiations also resulted in an April 26, 2006 resolution by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission IC (\u201cANC IC\u201d) supporting the project.\nOn January 26, 2005, petitioner applied for a permit to subdivide the property for sale as seventy-nine condominium units. The permit was issued, with the approval of the HPRB, on July 26, 2005. On September 14, 2005, petitioner filed applications with the D.C. Department of Regulatory and Consumer Affairs (\u201cDCRA\u201d) for permits to prepare the site for construction (including construction staging, excavation, sheeting, and shoring), to alter and renovate the existing buildings, and to build new structures. The permit for construction staging and sidewalk usage was issued on December 12, 2005. The HPO filed an application for historic landmark designation on January 6, 2006 \u2014 after the permit for construction staging and sidewalk usage was issued, but while the permits for excavation, sheeting, shoring, alteration/renovation and new construction were still pending. After the application for landmark designation was filed, the DCRA was notified immediately and petitioner was notified a few days later. Despite having been given notice of the landmark application in early January, the DCRA issued permits for excavation, sheeting and shoring on February 1 and for new construction on February 8, 2006. At a hearing held by the HPRB on February 2, 2006, on the application for landmark designation, petitioner \u201c[did] not question the historic merit of the building,\u201d but complained about the timing of the landmark application. On February 23, 2006, the HPRB voted to designate the property an historic landmark and further recommended its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. On March 1, 2006, the DCRA was notified of the landmark designation and was asked by the HPO to void the two permits (for excavation, sheeting and shoring, and for construction) that had been issued after the application for landmark designation was filed. Petitioner received notification, dated March 6, 2006, that the HPRB had designated the property an historic landmark.\nSpecifically, the HPRB determined that petitioner\u2019s construction permits had been issued in error by the DCRA due to the HPRB\u2019s designation of the property as an historic landmark, and should be voided, noting that: \u201cpermit applications related to this property cannot be issued without historic preservation review pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 6-1104 through 6-1108. That is the basis for this request for revocation.\u201d The HPRB also recommended that the petitioner\u2019s proposed development for the property was inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, and, therefore, the permits should not be issued.\nPetitioner requested a hearing before the Mayor\u2019s Agent to reject the HPRB\u2019s recommendation and uphold the validity of the permits that had been issued by DCRA. Intervenor, Committee of 100 of the Federal City, opposed the project; the DCPL and ANC IC, supported it. After the hearing, the Mayor\u2019s Agent, agreeing with the HPRB\u2019s recommendation, voided the permits that had been issued by DCRA after the landmark designation application had been filed, finding that:\nThe project as submitted requires the demolition of significant exterior historic features, including the chimneys and major portions of the building that are visible from the courtyard, all of which are otherwise protected by the Act. Such a demolition would hardly be contributory to efforts to retain or enhance the landmark, despite [petitioner\u2019s] assertion that its proposal would encourage the adaptation of the property for current use. HPRB, in adopting the staff [HPO] report, specifically found that, \u201c[^construction [sic] of the tower would require demolition of significant parts of the embassy and chancery. Most of the northwest quadrant of the landmark would be demolished [ ] on the north side of the courtyard, only the facade would be retained....\nHPRB determined that the proposed partial demolition was not consistent with the purposes of the Act. As May- or\u2019s Agent, I defer to and adopt HPRB\u2019s finding as the expert agency charged with reviewing proposed demolitions under the Act.\nEvaluating this project within the guidelines of the Act, the Mayor\u2019s Agent does not consider it to be one that qualifies as \u201cSpecial Merit\u201d, which is defined by the Act as, \u201ca plan or building having significant benefits to the District of Columbia or to the community by virtue of: 1) Exemplary architecture; 2) Specific features of land planning; or 3) Social or other benefits having a high priority for community services.\u201d....\nGiven the substantial economic value remaining in this multimillion dollar property, and [petitioner\u2019s] familiarity with and intentional action under the existing regulatory scheme, the Mayor\u2019s Agent concludes that [petitioner] has not show [sic] economic hardship amounting to a taking under these circumstances.\nThis petition for judicial review of the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s decision ensued.\nII.\nDISCUSSION\nA. The Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act, D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1101, et seq.\nUnder the Act, the HPRB is empowered to \u201c[designate and maintain a current inventory of historic landmarks.... \u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 6 \u2014 1103(c)(3). The HPRB has authority to \u201cinitiate a historic landmark or historic district designation by directing the staff to prepare an application.... \u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 207.1. The HPRB is also tasked with \u201c[a]dvis[ing] the Mayor on the compatibility with the purposes of [the Act] of the applications pursuant to \u00a7 6-1104 through 6-1108 [for demolition, alteration, division, new construction, and preliminary review].\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1103(e)(Z). The HPO is \u201cthe administrative staff of the ... Historic Preservation Review Board.\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 9901 (2007). The Mayor\u2019s Agent is the person appointed to exercise the Mayor\u2019s authority under the Act, to make \u201cthe final determination on the approval or denial of applications for demolition, alteration, new construction, and subdivision subject to the Historic Protection Act....\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 400.1. \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s Agent shall make these findings after having received and duly considered the recommendations from ... the [HPRB]_\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 400.2.\nB. Jurisdiction\nAs a preliminary matter, petitioner argues that the plain language of the Act bars the HPRB and the Mayor\u2019s Agent from asserting jurisdiction to review applications for permits that were already pending before the application for landmark designation was filed. It further suggests that allowing \u201clate-filed\u201d designation applications to apply to pending applications for building permits could result in indefinite delays, and would eviscerate the protection of the two ninety-day periods the statute mandates for a hearing and decision on applications for landmark designation. Petitioner relies primarily on the statutory language which provides that \u201c[b]efore the Mayor may issue a permit\u201d to demolish, alter, subdivide, or build new construction on the site of an \u201chistoric landmark,\u201d the \u201cMayor shall review\u201d the permit application in accordance with the Act. D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-1104(a) (demolitions), -1105(a) (alterations), -1106(a) (subdivisions), -1107(a) (new construction). This language implies, petitioner argues, that the site for which permits are sought has to be designated a historic landmark before the Mayor can base the issuance (or denial) of permits on a review pursuant to the Act. Therefore, according to petitioner, since the property in this case had not yet been designated an historic landmark when petitioner applied for the permits, the Act should not have played a role in the issuance of the permits.\nWe conclude that petitioner\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the Act\u2019s definition of \u201chistoric landmark,\u201d as implemented by regulations issued pursuant to the Act. The statute\u2019s definition of \u201chistoric landmark\u201d includes a \u201cbuilding ... and its site ... for which an application for [historic landmark designation] is pending\u201d with the HPRB. D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(6)(B). The regulations further provide that upon the \u201cofficial filing\u201d of an application for landmark designation, \u201cthe application is considered a pending application, and if the property is a proposed historic landmark, it is protected by the Act.\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 208.2. This includes properties for which permit applications have already been filed. See D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(6)(B) (providing that the HPRB \u201cwill determine within 90 days of receipt of an application pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 6-1104 to 6-1108 [referring to permits for demolition, alteration, subdivision and new construction] whether to list such property as an historic landmark.\u201d) (emphasis added). As the application was filed by HPO on January 6, 2006, and officially filed as of the same date, it was deemed a \u201cpending application\u201d and since the application was for historic landmark designation, the property was \u201cprotected by the Act\u201d as of that date.\nThe regulations seek to mitigate any potential unfairness from such interim protection by the requirement that when construction permits are pending, the HPRB must both hold a hearing and come to a final decision within ninety days of the application for landmark designation. See 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.5. (\u201cIf a historic landmark application is filed when a permit application subject to review under the Act is pending at DCRA, the ninety (90) day period for a determination on the designation shall be counted from the date the historic landmark application is filed.\u201d) (emphasis added). To meet this goal, the regulations provide that DCRA is to be notified \u201c[i]mmediately\u201d after an application is officially filed, and the owner of the property subject to an application for landmark designation is to be notified of same \u201c[wjithin ten days of an official filing.\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 209.1 & 209.2. Upon being notified of the application for landmark designation, the property owner is to advise the HPO within five days if there are any permit applications pending before DCRA, see 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.6, so as to trigger the HPRB\u2019s expedited consideration.\nPetitioner applied for its permits on September 14, 2005, and the HPO applied for landmark designation on January 6, 2006. Since the historic landmark application was filed \u201cwhen a permit application subject to review under the Act [was] pending at DCRA,\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.5, the Act\u2019s provisions applied to consideration of the permits, so long as HPRB made a decision concerning landmark designation within ninety days after the application was made. The HPRB did so; it designated the property an historic landmark on February 23, 2006, and communicated its decision to petitioner on March 6, 2006, well within the ninety-day deadline in the regulation.\nPetitioner has a different interpretation of the regulation, and argues that because its property had not yet been designated a landmark, the permit applications with respect to that property that were pending before DCRA could not yet \u201cbe subject to review under the Act.\u201d Id. We reject this literal reading of part of the language of \u00a7 209.5 of the regulation, as it contradicts other parts of the regulation, and renders it, as a whole, circular and nonsensical. The regulation contemplates that historic landmark applications might be filed after permit applications are filed, see id., otherwise, the language of the regulation (\u201cIf a historic landmark application is filed when a permit application subject to review under the Act is pending at DCRA,\u201d id. (emphasis added)), would have no meaning. Under petitioner\u2019s analysis, the property for which permits are sought would already have to be subject to the Act (by being in a historic district or already designated an historic landmark) before the permits are subject to review under the Act. But if that were so, there would be no need for \u201ca determination on the designation\u201d to be made within ninety days of the application for landmark designation, \u201c[i]f a historic landmark application is filed\u201d while permit applications are pending. Id. Read in context, and giving effect to the regulation as a whole, we interpret \u00a7 209.5 as requiring expedited (ninety-day) consideration to applications for landmark designation in those cases where there are applications for permits pending before DCRA. There is no basis, therefore, for petitioner\u2019s argument that the \u201clate-filing\u201d of a landmark application \u2014 after a permit application is filed\u2014 would result in indefinite delays, because the HPRB is constrained by this defined deadline. Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 209.5 does not take account of the statutory definition of \u201chistoric landmark,\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(6)(B), nor of another regulation, 10A DCMR \u00a7 208.2, both of which establish that the Act\u2019s protection extends to properties that are the subject of pending applications for historic designation. See District of Columbia v. Place, 892 A.2d 1108, 1113 (D.C.2006) (language in statutes and regulations to be interpreted to give intent to all provisions, if at all possible).\nAlthough petitioner\u2019s principal argument is that the Act does not apply to permit applications that were filed with DCRA before the application for landmark designation with the HPRB, petitioner raised in its reply brief and at oral argument that the ninety-day period for HPRB\u2019s decision began to run from the date it filed applications for permits with DCRA, and not, as \u00a7 209.5 provides, from the date the application for landmark designation was filed with the HPRB. Petitioner relies on the statutory language that, for a property to be considered an \u201chistoric landmark\u201d based on the filing of an application for designation, the HPRB must make the landmark designation within ninety days of \u201creceipt of an application pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 6-1104 to 6-1008,\u201d which refers to applications for permits. D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(6)(B). Read in isolation, the statutory language would support petitioner\u2019s argument, and, if applied in this case, the Embassy property would not have come within the statutory definition, because the HPRB\u2019s landmark designation in February 2005 was made more than ninety days after the permit applications were filed in September of 2004. But petitioner\u2019s interpretation is less persuasive when considered in the context of the other period designated in the same statutory definition, which provides that the HPRB shall schedule a hearing within ninety days of the fifing for landmark designation. See id. Although it is theoretically possible for the HPRB to both schedule a hearing within ninety days of an application for landmark designation and decide the issue on the merits within ninety days of permit applications, the timetable can become unrealistically tight if permit applications have been filed before the landmark application (as we have ruled the Act and regulations contemplate). This is particularly so if one considers the number of parties to be notified of a pending landmark designation. See note 11, supra. Moreover, as the District points out, the current statutory language reflects an amendment, enacted in 1998, see D.C. Law 12-86, \u00a7 503(a), 45 D.C.Reg. 1172 (April 29, 1998), that changed the previous statutory definition of \u201chistoric landmark\u201d that not only required the HPRB to determine \u201cwithin receipt of [permit] applications [reviewable under the Act] whether to fist such property\u201d as an historic landmark within ninety days of such applications, but also enjoined that \u201cany property not so fisted will not be considered an historic landmark\u201d within the Act. D.C.Code \u00a7 5-1002(6)(B) (1981). This latter provision was deleted, and is not contained in the current definition of \u201chistoric landmark.\u201d Subsequent to the 1998 amendment, the Mayor and the HPRB promulgated 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.5 to specifically address what the timetable should be in situations where an application for landmark designation is made after permit applications have been filed. See 51 D.C.Reg. 7447, 7470 (July 30, 2004).\nWe defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering unless it is unreasonable, plainly wrong or inconsistent with the purpose of the legislation. See D.C. Pres. League v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 711 A.2d 1273, 1275 (D.C. 1998). In light of the amendment to the statute\u2019s definition of \u201chistoric landmark,\u201d and the purpose of the Act, we cannot say that the agency\u2019s specification of the procedures to be followed, and the timetable to be applied, in the limited class of cases where a landmark application is filed after permit applications is unreasonable. At most, a property owner with pending permit applications will have to wait ninety days for a final decision on landmark designation. The agency\u2019s regulations create a logical continuum that balances the interest of property owners and the public interest in historic preservation: where there are no permit applications pending, the HPRB has ninety days to schedule a hearing on an application for landmark designation, but there is no prescribed deadline within which a decision must be made, see 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.4; where a landmark designation is filed followed by permit applications, the HPRB must hold a hearing within ninety days of the landmark application and come to a decision within ninety days of the permit application, see D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(b)(B); but where a landmark designation application is filed after permit applications, the HPRB must both hold a hearing and decide whether to make the designation within ninety days, counted from the date the designation application is official. See 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.5.\nAs the application for landmark designation brought the property within the purview of the Act, and HPRB acted to designate the property an historic landmark within the ninety-day period prescribed in the regulation, we conclude that the May- or\u2019s Agent and the HPRB had jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s construction permits for consistency with the purposes of the Act.\nC. Equitable Relief: Laches and Es-toppel\nPetitioner argues that, even if the Mayor\u2019s Agent had jurisdiction to review the pending permit applications under the Act, the doctrines of laches and estoppel apply to preclude denial of the permits. Specifically, petitioner argues that the application for landmark designation was filed too late-not only after design for the project was well underway (including issuance, after HPRB approval, of a subdivision permit), but after Mr. Maloney, the State Historic Preservation Officer, had impliedly given a green light so long as petitioner satisfied local preservation groups.\nWe agree with the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s analysis that the laches argument is irrelevant given that the scope of his authority is limited to review of permit applications under the standards set forth in the Act, and does not allow him to review the HPRB\u2019s landmark designation itself. \u201c[T]he limited task of the Mayor\u2019s Agent is to evaluate ... a [permit] application in accordance with the Preservation Act, and nothing more.\u201d D.C. Pres. League v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 646 A.2d 984, 990 (D.C.1994) (noting that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the Preservation Act that allows the Mayor\u2019s agent to engage in a balancing of interests which takes into account such factors as the cost of refurbishing the dilapidated structure and the threat it poses to the safety and welfare of the community\u201d); see 10A DCMR \u00a7 104.1 (\u201cThe Mayor\u2019s Agent reviews proposed work affecting historic properties, including demolition, alteration, subdivision, and new construction, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Historic Protection Act (D.C. Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-1104 through 6-1108).\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument for the application of laches is more appropriately directed against the HPRB\u2019s designation of the property as an historic landmark, but, as noted, petitioner participated in that proceeding and did not contest the property\u2019s historic value, nor did petitioner challenge the HPRB\u2019s action on the basis of untimeliness by seeking judicial review in Superior Court. See Metro. Baptist Church v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 718 A.2d 119, 123-24 (D.C.1998) (challenge to the HPRB\u2019s designation of property as historic landmark properly filed as an original action in the Superior Court because designation is not a contested case); see also note 13, supra (noting that contested case procedures \u2014 and consequent direct review by this court \u2014 do not apply to HPRB landmark designation proceeding).\nThe equitable doctrines of laches and estoppel are to be narrowly applied against the government. See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 419-24, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990); Rann v. Chao, 358 U.S.App. D.C. 122, 127, 346 F.3d 192, 197 (2003); Wieck v. D.C. Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 383 A.2d 7, 10 (D.C.1978). \u201cLaches is a species of estoppel, being defined as the omission to assert a right for an unreasonable and unsatisfactorily explained length of time under circumstances prejudicial to the party asserting laches.\u201d Wieck, 383 A.2d at 11 (quoting 3 Arden H. Rathkopf & Charles A. Rathkopf, Law of Zoning and Planning, at 67-1 (3d ed.1972)) (quotation marks omitted). Petitioner\u2019s reliance on Wieck, a zoning case, to support its claim that this court should rule on laches is misplaced. In Wieck, the court considered the application of laches in the first instance because the BZA itself could have considered the equitable argument in deciding whether to enforce its orders, and the record was sufficient to make that determination. Here, on the other hand, the Mayor\u2019s Agent had no discretion to review the timing of HPRB\u2019s landmark designation; nor do we, as our role is to determine whether the decision of the Mayor\u2019s Agent with respect to the permit applications was capricious or arbitrary, and supported by substantial evidence of record. For these reasons, we decline to entertain petitioner\u2019s arguments for equitable relief based on laches.\nWith respect to estoppel, petitioner points to the same underlying facts, its detrimental reliance on Mr. Maloney\u2019s \u201cassurances\u201d that no application for landmark designation would be made by expending significant funds to develop a project it thought would not be subject to scrutiny under the Act. As did the Mayor\u2019s Agent, we address this issue in the context of whether petitioner suffered unreasonable economic hardship \u2014 an unconstitutional takings argument \u2014 which we discuss below. We, therefore, turn to consider the petition for review on the merits of the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s decision to deny the permit applications.\nIII.\nThe Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s Decision that Petitioner Has not Demonstrated Compatibility with the Act, Special Merit, or Unreasonable Economic Hardship Sufficient to Warrant Issuance of the Permits\nThis court\u2019s review of the May- or\u2019s Agent\u2019s decision is \u201climited and narrow.\u201d Reneau v. District of Columbia, 676 A.2d 913, 917 (D.C.1996). \u2018We must uphold the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s decision if the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole and the conclusions of law flow rationally from these findings.\u201d Kalorama Heights Ltd. P\u2019ship v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 655 A.2d 865, 868 (D.C.1995). \u201cMoreover, when ... the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s [ ] decision is based on an \u2018interpretation of the statute and regulations it administers, that interpretation will be sustained unless shown to be unreasonable....\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nova Univ. v. Educ. Inst. Licensure Comm\u2019n, 483 A.2d 1172, 1190 (D.C.1984)).\nThe Act provides that no \u201csubdivision ... shall be admitted to record\u201d and \u201cno permit [to demolish or alter the exteri- or of an historic landmark] shall be issued\u201d unless the Mayor finds that it is \u201cnecessary in the public interest,\u201d or that failure to do so will result in \u201cunreasonable economic hardship\u201d to the owner. D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-1104(e), -1105(f), -1106(e). To be \u201cnecessary in the public interest,\u201d a permit must be \u201cconsistent with the purposes\u201d of the Act, or \u201cnecessary to allow the construction of a project of special merit.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-1102(10). In the case of application for permits for new construction, \u201c[t]he permit shall be issued unless the Mayor ... finds that the design of the building and the character of the ... historic landmark are incompatible.... \u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 6 \u2014 1107(f). We defer to the expertise of the Mayor\u2019s Agent (and the HPRB) as to what constitutes \u201cspecial merit\u201d sufficient to justify subdivision, demolition or alteration, and what is \u201cincompatible\u201d (in the case of new construction) related to historic properties. See Hotel Tabard Inn v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 747 A.2d 1168, 1175 (D.C.2000) (determination of special merit based on exemplary architecture \u201cis squarely within the expertise of the May- or\u2019s Agent.... On this record we see no reason why we should not defer to that expertise.\u201d).\nAs the Mayor\u2019s Agent noted, the demolition of a significant portion (which the Mayor\u2019s Agent found would be at least ten percent) of an historic property is fundamentally inconsistent (\u201cwould hardly be contributory\u201d) with the goal of historic preservation. To overcome that inconsistency, the project would have to be one of \u201cspecial merit,\u201d which the Act defines as one providing \u201csignificant benefits to the District of Columbia or to the community by virtue of exemplary architecture, specific features of land planning, or social or other benefits having a high priority for community services.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(11). As supported by the testimony of Charles J. Robertson, a representative for the Committee of 100, the mere use of fine materials, does not equate to \u201cexemplary architecture.\u201d Or, as explained by Mr. Maloney,\n[T]he contrast between the architectural design and features of the new tower and the original landmark [are not] a component of their compatibility.\nThe Beaux Art design and its development along this section of 16th Street, and the architectural and design features that characterized it, have made a dramatic impact, and should be preserved. This concept included impressive, stately, widely spaced buildings, each with breathing room, stressing symmetry in both elevation and primary design features.\n[Embassy\u2019s] efforts are to squeeze too big a structure upon too tight a sight [sic], directly conflicting what the Beaux Art design is all about, creating an infill and cluster that is not consistent with that design and style.\nContrasts between old and new structures that did not reflect or recognize the design principles of the original were not compatible.\nThe loss of symmetry in mass and design features and the loss of appropriate spacing simply were not acceptable contrasts from a preservation point of view as they were incompatible with the original.\nThe materials of the new structure, reflecting a machine-made modernism, conflicted with the natural stone and material of the original landmark, which contrast did not enhance the original, but detracted from and was incompatible with it.\nThe project was not characterized by an extremely high level of finish, design, or details that would make it exemplary\nThe project is not of the same exceptional quality as the original landmark.\nThere is also substantial evidence to support the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s finding that the project would not bring a significant social benefit which merited the destruction of a substantial part of this historic property. As the Mayor\u2019s Agent remarked:\n[Pjroposed production of 79 \u201chigh end\u201d condominium housing units .... to a few citizens, even though possibly providing some potential minimal general benefits to the public as a whole, [is] hardly sufficiently \u201cspecial\u201d enough to warrant a \u201cspecial merit\u201d status.\nWe have previously upheld this community-based interpretation of what constitutes \u201csocial or other benefits having a high priority for community services.\u201d Kalorama Heights Ltd. P\u2019ship, 655 A.2d 865 at 878 (noting that statutory definition requiring \u201c \u2018high priority for community services\u2019 .... makes clear that the offered benefits must be for the community at large, not primarily for a subset of privileged persons.\u201d (citation omitted)).\nPetitioner\u2019s principal argument is that the decision of the Mayor\u2019s Agent denying the permits resulted in \u201cunreasonable economic hardship,\u201d which the Act defines to mean \u201cthat failure to issue a permit would amount to a taking of the owner\u2019s property without just compensation....\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(14) (2001). The Act therefore incorporates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against the taking of property without fair compensation. See U.S. Const. amend. V, (\u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation\u201d). As the Supreme Court has recognized, its regulatory takings jurisprudence depends on \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries ... [that] have identified several factors that have particular significance.\u201d Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978) (hereinafter \u201cPenn Central \u201d). These factors generally include (1) the character of the government action; (2) the economic impact of government regulation on the property owner; and (3) the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations. See id. There is no single \u201ctest,\u201d however, based on meeting each of the three factors; rather these factors describe general considerations that have been considered by the Court in answering the only question at issue in any takings case: whether the government has gone too far through its regulations and arrogated property to itself without the payment of just compensation to the owner. See id. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646. Specifically in connection with landmark designations properly made pursuant to established laws and procedures, the takings inquiry focuses on \u201cwhether the interference with [petitioner\u2019s] property is of such a magnitude that \u2018there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain [it].\u2019 \u201d Id. at 136, 98 S.Ct. 2646 (quoting Pa. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 413, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922)). The question of the \u201cseverity of the impact\u201d of the designation \u201crequires a careful assessment of the impact of the regulation\u201d on the property, including whether application of landmark laws interferes in any way with the owner\u2019s current uses of the property at the time of designation and primary expectations concerning the use of the land. Id. at 136, 98 S.Ct. 2646.\nConsistent with the Court\u2019s framework for analysis, the Mayor\u2019s Agent determined that for there to be \u201cunreasonable economic hardship\u201d under the Act, petitioner must establish \u201cthat there are no reasonable economic uses for the building as it exists.... If a reasonable economic use exists, there is no unreasonable economic hardship from the denial of the ... permit ... even if a more beneficial use of the property has been found.\u201d\nWith respect to the economic impact on the owner of denial of the permits, petitioner\u2019s witnesses testified that any further attempt to develop the property would begin twelve million dollars \u201cin the hole,\u201d representing the amounts it had already expended: $4.7 in design costs, $2.9 in re-zoning the site, and $4 to $5 million in redesign. But petitioner\u2019s sunk costs are not the proper basis to gauge adverse economic impact. \u201c[T]he submission that [a property owner] may establish a \u2018taking\u2019 simply by showing that [he has] been denied the ability to exploit a property interest that [he] heretofore had believed was available for development is quite simply untenable.\u201d Id. at 130, 98 S.Ct. 2646.\nIt is the value of the property itself that is relevant in determining the economic impact of the governmental action on the owner. See Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594, 82 S.Ct. 987, 8 L.Ed.2d 130 (1962) (no taking found where claimant prohibited from continuing to operate gravel mining business, but property\u2019s value was not reduced). And even though the potential for increased value of the property is relevant, \u201ca showing of diminution in property value would not establish a \u2018taking\u2019 if the restriction had been imposed as a result of historic-district legislation.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 131, 98 S.Ct. 2646. Rather, it is the lack of reasonable economic uses for the property that would establish a taking. See 900 G St. Assocs. v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. & Cmty. Dev., 430 A.2d 1387, 1390 (D.C.1981) (\u201c[I]f there is a reasonable alternative economic use for the property after the imposition of the restriction on that property, there is no taking.... \u201d). \u201cPetitioner had the burden of proof in the hearing to establish that no other reasonable economic use for the [property] existed.\u201d Id. at 1391.\nThe record supports the determination by the Mayor\u2019s Agent that petitioner failed to prove that the property lost any reasonable economic use. See Kalorama Heights Ltd. P\u2019ship, 655 A.2d at 871 (concluding that substantial evidence supported May- or\u2019s Agent\u2019s decision that owner did not suffer unreasonable economic hardship where unsolicited offers had been received to purchase property and \u201clatest assessed value of the property \u2018was over a quarter of a million dollars more than the price at which it was purchased two years ago.\u2019 \u201d). The property remains available for use as it was originally intended and used by the Italian government for many years. Moreover, although the Mayor\u2019s Agent disapproved of the design concept proposed because it entailed demolition of a fourth of the property and creation of a tower that the HPRB, the expert agency, considered incongruous with the architectural style of the existing property and disruptive of the neighborhood overall, petitioner \u2014 who retains the permit to subdivide the property that was issued before the application for landmark designation was filed \u2014 may propose a different design that meets the concerns raised by the HPRB. In its Report to the HPRB, for example, the HPO noted that condominium units could be built with \u201cthe tower in mid-block, away from 16th Street vistas, ... not even visible from Mozart Place. The site plan could enhance the property with a second courtyard rather than ruining the existing one.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s focus on the diminished margin of profitability if it were to modify its project to follow the design alternatives that the HPRB suggested, as is the case of sunk costs, is not determinative of whether the economic impact is so severe as to implicate the Fifth Amendment. See 900 G Street Assocs., 430 A.2d at 1392 (upholding Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s denial of demolition permit where there was an alternative reasonable use of building \u201cwithout consideration of the cost of its acquisition or the profit petitioner anticipated from its operation, use, or sale-\u201d).\nWe consider petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the timing of HPRB\u2019s designation in terms of whether it had \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations\u201d that were so thwarted by denial of the permits as to constitute a taking. In Pa. Coal, the leading case on this question, land owners sold the surface rights to their property, but retained the right to mine the coal beneath without recourse. See 260 U.S. at 412, 43 S.Ct. 158. A subsequently enacted statute aimed at preventing damage to homes above coal mines, however, made it commercially impracticable to mine the coal. See id. at 413-14, 43 S.Ct. 158. As the owners were unaware that an unanticipated restriction would be placed on their right to mine the coal before they sold the surface rights, the Court concluded that the regulation went \u201ctoo far\u201d in prohibiting them from doing so. See id. at 415, 43 S.Ct. 158.\nIn this ease petitioner claims that it also was impacted by an unanticipated landmark designation, and that it made significant investments in the design and planning for development of the property based on representations that it claims it received from Mr. Maloney of the HPO that there would be no landmark designation. Therefore, the question is whether the interactions between Mr. Maloney and petitioner and the expenditures petitioner consequently made are sufficient to establish a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that was thwarted by the landmark designation of the property.\nThere is no doubt that denial of the permits has frustrated petitioner\u2019s plan to develop the property in the manner it prefers. As already noted, however, not all development of the condominium project has necessarily been foreclosed, and a different design could be approved, and, in fact, has been suggested, by the HPRB. But even if we assume, for present purposes, that petitioner\u2019s development plan has been thwarted, the Mayor\u2019s Agent found that the petitioner\u2019s investment-backed expectations were not reasonable. That finding is supported by substantial evidence: the vague assertions made by Mr. Maloney coupled with the absence of assurances (requested or given) that no landmark application would be filed, as well as Mr. Baranes\u2019s caution to petitioner that the option petitioner chose \u2014 to bypass HPRB review and rely on private negotiations and agreements \u2014 entailed \u201csome risk.\u201d Petitioner, as well as the HPO, were well aware of the historic significance of the property, and Mr. Baranes had advised that if a landmark application were filed, it would be granted. As the Mayor\u2019s Agent remarked, one who is about to embark on such an expensive and complex project requiring significant demolition, alteration and new construction of a known historic property would require more than a casual statement that the HPO had \u201cno intent at the time\u201d to designate the property as an historic landmark before proceeding on that premise. That statement by all accounts was made in 2001, in connection with the first proposed design, but in Spring 2004, when the design was changed to add the tower the HPRB found to be especially incongruous, Mr. Maloney made no secret of his objection. Moreover, although petitioner negotiated and entered into agreements with the private parties more likely to file for landmark designation, it was well aware that under the Act the HPO was entitled to initiate designation proceedings, and that petitioner\u2019s agreement with DCPL did not preclude the HPO from doing so. Thus, this case is unlike Pa. Coal, where the land owners had no way of knowing that unforeseen new regulations would affect their property rights, after having taken reasonable precautions in their private negotiations with the only parties known to have an interest. Here, petitioner took a calculated (and, as it turned out, unwise) risk and commenced the project in the face of Mr. Maloney\u2019s expressed concerns without either returning to the HPO to obtain a firm assurance that it would not seek to designate petitioner\u2019s property as an historic landmark, or petitioner itself initiating the application process in order to dispel any uncertainty. On this record, we are constrained to affirm the Mayor\u2019s Agent\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s expectations were not reasonable.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the HPRB and the Mayor\u2019s Agent had jurisdiction to review the permits under the Historic Preservation Act, and that denial of these permits was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was supported by substantial evidence of record. The petition to reverse the Mayor\u2019s Agent is, therefore, denied.\nSo ordered.\n. According to Mr. Baranes's testimony, applications for designation are usually filed by private entities who are actively involved in the preservation of historic properties in the city. The regulations provide, however, that \u201cHpplication for designation of a property as a historic landmark or historic district [may] be made ... by the [Historic Preservation Review] Board, a public agency, governmental unit or department, [and] Advisory Neighborhood Commission....\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 203.1 (2007). The parties agree that it was not common for the HPRB to apply for landmark designation.\n. \" \u2018State Historic Preservation Officer\u2019 means the person designated by the Mayor to administer the National Register Program within the District of Columbia established pursuant to the Historic Preservation Act....\u2019\u2019 D.C.Code\u00a7 6-1102(12).\n. The DCPL has filed a brief amicus curiae in this case. It is \"neither in support of nor opposition to the parties in this case,\u201d although it continues to support the agreement it reached with petitioner in favor of renovating the property. As DCPL recognizes, such an agreement is \u201cnot binding on third parties, cannot be enforced by the public at large, and, unless they include the HPRB and HPO, do not reflect the opinion of the agencies that implement the public policy of the District reflected in the Preservation Act.\u201d The thrust of DCPL's brief is to support the authority of the HPRB and Mayor's Agent to review permits for construction that are pending when an application for landmark designation is filed.\n. No specific permit for demolition was requested, and none of the permits that was issued expressly authorized demolition.\n. The HPRB noted other properties on 16th Street \"that are not yet designated, but appear eligible for designation as historic landmarks,\u201d including the \u201cHenderson Castle retaining wall and gateposts,\u201d and the embassies of Lithuania, Poland, Mexico, Ecuador, Cuba and Spain.\n. The HPRB is composed of members appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council of the District of Columbia. See D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-1102(7) & 1103(a). The members of the HPRB who made the designation in this case were: Tersh Boasberg, Chairman; Kathy Henderson; Anne Lewis; Gail S. Lowe; Robert Sonderman; John Vlach; and Amy Weinstein.\n. The Mayor\u2019s Agent who made the decision challenged in this case is Rohulamin Quan-der, Esq.\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1102(6)(B) provides:\n\"Historic landmark\u201d means a building, structure, object, or feature, and its site, or a site ... [Qisted in the District of Columbia\u2019s inventory of historic sites, or for which application for such listing is pending with the Historic Preservation Review Board, provided that, the Review Board shall schedule a hearing on the application within 90 days of one having been filed, and will determine within 90 days of receipt of an application pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 6-1104 to 6-1108 whether to list such property as a historic landmark. ...\n(Emphasis added).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1104(a) provides:\nBefore the Mayor may issue a permit to demolish an historic landmark or a building or structure in an historic district, the Mayor shall review the permit application in accordance with this section and place notice of the application in the District of Columbia Register.\nD.C.Code \u00a7 6-1105(a) provides:\nBefore the Mayor may issue a permit to alter the exterior or site of an historic landmark or of a building or structure in an historic district, the Mayor shall review the permit application in accordance with this section and place notice of the application in the District of Columbia Register. D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1106(a) provides:\nBefore the Mayor may admit to record any subdivision of an historic landmark or of a property in an historic district, the Mayor shall review the application for admission to record in accordance with this section and place notice of the application in the District of Columbia Register. D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1107(a) provides:\nBefore the Mayor may issue a permit to construct a building or structure in an historic district or on the site of an historic landmark, the Mayor shall review the permit application in accordance with this section and shall place notice of the application in the District of Columbia Register.\n. Petitioner argues that the HPO\u2019s application was not \u201cofficial\u201d until February 2, 2006, when the HPRB accepted the nomination for consideration as a District of Columbia landmark. However, 10A DCMR \u00a7 208.2 provides that an application is \"considered a pending application, and if the property is a proposed historic landmark, it is protected by the Act\u201d when the HPRB\u2019s \"staff has completed the official filing\u201d of the application for landmark designation. The HPRB\u2019s staff has ten days to determine whether an application is complete. 10A DCMR \u00a7 208.1. \u201cIf the application is complete, and the applicant has paid the applicable filing fee, the staff shall assign a case number, date stamp, and officially file the application.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Applications initiated by the HPRB are processed \"according to the procedures required for any other application, except that tile filing fee shall be waived.\u201d 10A DCMR \u00a7 207.2. The letter from the HPRB, on which petitioner relies, states that the application was \u201cofficially on file\u201d with the HPRB as of January 6, 2006, the day it was filed. The record supports that the application was complete, and thus, \"official\" and considered a \"pending application\u201d under the statute, as of January 6, 2006.\n. Also to be notified within ten days of the official filing are the applicant, the affected Advisory Neighborhood Commission and the ANC single member district commissioner for the area where the property is located, see 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.2; within sixty days, notice is to be mailed to a \u201cpublic mailing list\u201d described in the regulations. See 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.3.\n. Before the 1998 amendment, D.C.Code \u00a7 5-1002(6)(B) (1981) provided:\n(6) \"Historic landmark\u201d means a building, structure, object, or feature, and its site, or a site:\n(B) Listed in the District of Columbia\u2019s inventory of historic sites, or for which application for such listing is pending with the Historic Preservation Review Board; provided, that the Review Board will determine within 90 days of receipt of an application pursuant to \u00a7 5-1004, \u00a7 5-1005, \u00a7 5-1006, \u00a7 5-1007, or 5-1008 whether to list such property, and any property not so listed will not be considered an historic landmark within the terms of this subchap-ter.\n. The definition of \"historic landmark\u201d was again amended in 2000, to delete the provision that required HPRB \"to designate historic landmarks under the contested case procedures....\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 5-1003(c)(5) (1981) (2000 Supp.) (amended by D.C. law 13-172, \u00a7 403(a), 47 D.C.Reg. 6308, 6325 (Oct. 19, 2000)).\n. In Wieck, the Chief of the Zoning Inspection Branch issued orders to the former owner of property to partially dismantle a building, which provided rental income to current property owner, but the orders were not enforced for over six years, which the court considered an \u201cinexcusable delay.\u201d See 383 A.2d at 12.\n. As the Mayor\u2019s Agent explained, \"[t]he Council intended only a short list of three exceptions [public interest, unreasonable economic hardship, and special merit] to justify and override the public policy and statutory enactment, which were both designed and adopted to retain historically significant structures.\u201d\n. Although petitioner did not apply for a demolition permit, the plans it submitted with its applications for new construction clearly contemplated demolition of \"significant parts of the embassy and chancery.\u201d\n. Petitioner presented evidence that the new construction would be made with \"high end\u201d and expensive materials, and would include ornate plaster moldings more than a foot deep, \"a huge marble surround\u201d on one fireplace, and \"massive marble door-frames.\u201d\n. The \u201ccharacter\u201d of the government's action refers to whether the government has, by its regulations, effected the equivalent of a physical invasion or transfer of the owner\u2019s property. See Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646. Here, there was no physical invasion or transfer of petitioner\u2019s property, but a limitation on the development potential of the property.\n. Petitioner acquired the property in 2005 for $12,000,000. The Mayor's Agent noted that the District\u2019s proposed tax assessment for 2007 was based on a valuation of $12,395,500.\n. The deed of sale provided that the owner of the surface rights waived any claim against the seller from mining operations.\n. We note that the Act also provides an owner with a procedure to obtain a \"preliminary review\u201d of permits under the Act from the Mayor\u2019s Agent. See D.C.Code \u00a7 6-1108.\n. In Donnelly Assocs. Ltd. P'ship v. D.C. Historic Pres. Review Bd., 520 A.2d 270 (D.C. 1987), the court considered whether unreasonable delays by the HPRB in issuing landmark designations, which left property owners in indefinite limbo as to what they could do with their properties, constituted an unconstitutional taking. This court held that the HPRB \u201cmust list the property as an historic landmark within ninety days of receipt\u2019 of the property owner\u2019s demolition or alteration per-mit_\u201d Id. at 280 (interpreting the definition of \"historic landmark\u201d in D.C.Code \u00a7 5-1002(6)(B)(1981)). Donnelly, however, was decided in 1987 and predated the 1998 amendment to the statute and subsequent promulgation of 10A DCMR \u00a7 209.5. As the HPRB complied with the applicable regulatory deadlines, petitioner\u2019s reliance on Donnelly is misplaced.",
