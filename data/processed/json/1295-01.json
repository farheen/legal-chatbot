        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nIn this appeal from Family Court of ancillary matters following divorce, respondent-husband contests the Court\u2019s award of alimony to petitioner-wife based on application of the partnership equalization of income concept; its award of permanent alimony under 13 Del.C. \u00a7 1518(h) [since repealed]; and its purported marital property division award to wife of a future interest in husband\u2019s pension plan not yet \u201cvested\u201d.\nWife\u2019s petition for divorce on grounds of incompatibility following a marriage of over 20 years was filed in June, 1979. As of that date, a petitioner\u2019s right to alimony was foreclosed under 13 Del.C. \u00a7 1512 and was confined to 13 Del.C. \u00a7 1518(h) and certain limited amendments to \u00a7 1502 enacted in 1978. 61 Del.Laws, C. 204, effective January 24, 1978.\nOne month later, in July, 1979, both \u00a7\u00a7 1502 and 1512 were substantially rewritten so as to clearly authorize indefinite or permanent alimony to a petitioner as well as a respondent. 62 Del.Laws, C. 168, effective August 13,1979. However, the 1979 legislation operated prospectively only and previously-filed actions were governed by prior law.\nBecause the parties were married for over 20 years and the Court found the relationship of the parties during the marriage to be \u201cvery similar\u201d to that in R.E.T. v. A.L.T., Del.Supr., 410 A.2d 166 (1979), the Court framed its alimony award under \u00a7 1518(h) as follows: \u201cPartial alimony [in] an amount which would net\u201d wife $500 per month (in addition to her expected net income of about $1,100); and \u201cin addition, a sum to be determined after considering the tax consequences which will result in providing for each party equal spendable income.\u201d And the Court directed the award to continue until death of either party or wife\u2019s remarriage.\nThe Court thereby erroneously rejected husband\u2019s contention, re-asserted here, that before August, 1979 a petitioner could only be awarded temporary alimony-under \u00a7 1518(h).\nFamily Court\u2019s authority to make alimony awards under \u00a7 1518(h) was expressly limited \u2014 even as to marriages of 20 years or more \u2014 to awards on a \u201ctemporary\u201d basis. This was consistent with the statute\u2019s stated purpose \u2014 \u201cto assist a party to achieve independent financial status\u201d \u2014 and is reinforced by \u00a7 1518(h)\u2019s denomination of the alimony to be awarded as \u201ctemporary alimony.\u201d\nThe Court below has misconstrued this Court\u2019s decision in J.P.D. v. J.M.D., Del. Supr., 413 A.2d 1233 (1980) to mean that a party to a marriage of more than 20 years might, following divorce, be awarded alimony for an indefinite time under 13 Del.C. \u00a7 1518(h). The question here presented was not the issue in J.P.D. v. J.M.D., supra. Further, the Court below apparently relied on this Court\u2019s footnote reference in J.P.D. v. J.M.D., supra to the legislative synopsis found in 61 Del.Laws, C. 204 as supportive of its construction of \u00a7 1518(h). However, counsel for petitioner concedes the synopsis to be inconsistent with the Act\u2019s provisions. As we stated in J.P.D. v. J.M.D., alimony awarded under \u00a7 1512 (as written before its amendment by 62 Del.Laws, C. 168) \u201cmay be without limit in time\u201d whereas alimony awarded under \u00a7 1518 was \u201cmore limited in time since its purpose [was] \u2018to assist a party to achieve independent financial status.\u2019 \u201d 413 A.2d 1236.\nThe Court below further erred in concluding that the General Assembly\u2019s intent underlying its 1978 enactment of \u00a7 1518(h) could properly be deduced from a subsequent General Assembly\u2019s action, in 1979, of rewriting \u00a7 1512(a) and simultaneously repealing \u00a7 1518(h). See, 62 Del.Laws, C. 168. See also, Opinion of the Justices, Del. Supr., 385 A.2d 695, 703 (1978); Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Mass. Supr., 371 Mass. 186, 356 N.E.2d 236 (1976); see generally, 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction, \u00a7 49.11 (4th ed. 1973).\nAs to husband\u2019s pension fund (a contributory plan), the Court found it to be marital property with a present value of $15,319. But because husband\u2019s interest would not \u201cvest\u201d for some 18 years, until he reached 65 and retired, the Court ruled that, \u201cany consideration of the Pension Plan [should be] deferred until it is vested, when it will be considered in calculating alimony.\u201d The Court\u2019s Order following decision made no disposition of, or even reference to, the pension plan.\nThe Court thereby elected, not to treat husband\u2019s pension plan as property to be divided under 13 Del.C. \u00a7 1513, but to take into consideration husband\u2019s future pension income following retirement, along with his other income, in calculating wife\u2019s entitlement to future alimony. The Court was clearly entitled to treat husband\u2019s pension rights, whether vested or not, as \u201cmarital property\u201d under 13 Del.C. \u00a7 1513. Robert C.S. v. Barbara J.S., Del.Supr., 434 A.2d 383 (1981). However, had the Court ordered a division of husband\u2019s pension interest, wife\u2019s right would be limited to share in only the pension benefits that were earned by husband during the marriage. Robert C.S. v. Barbara J.S., supra. Contrary to husband\u2019s assertion, the Court\u2019s pension ruling did not award wife a \u201cfuture interest\u201d in husband\u2019s plan benefits to be earned following divorce. However, since we have found error in the Court\u2019s award to wife of permanent alimony, the Court\u2019s direction that the calculation of wife\u2019s future alimony should take into consideration husband\u2019s matured pension benefits necessarily falls.\nReversed and Remanded for new trial as to all ancillary matters relating to property division and alimony and related counsel fee awards.\n. It is presumed that the Trial Court meant to refer to \u201cmaturing\u201d rather than \u201cvesting\u201d. See, Robert C.S. v. Barbara J.S., supra, at 386, n. 3.",
