        "text": "THOMPSON, Associate Judge:\nAppellant Angel Miller-McGee sustained an extensive tear of her perineum during a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery of her first child and thereafter suffered fecal incontinence, necessitating a series of corrective surgeries. She appeals from the trial court\u2019s order dismissing, with prejudice, the action in which she sought to pursue a claim that the defendant hospital and obstetrician performed the assisted delivery without her informed consent. The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that Miller-McGee had failed to amend her complaint to add the lack of informed consent claim after the court had dismissed her other claims. In light of the procedural history of this case, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the suit without affording Miller-McGee an opportunity to amend her complaint. We therefore reverse and remand.\nFactual and Procedural Background\nOn September 1, 2000, appellant gave birth to a baby girl at the Washington Hospital Center. During the delivery, she suffered a large tear of her vagina that was caused by her baby being pulled through her vaginal canal with forceps. The tear developed into a rectovaginal fistula, causing appellant to have uncontrollable bowel movements through her vagina. She underwent two surgical procedures to correct the problem. On October 31, 2003, she filed a two-count amended complaint in the Superior Court against defendants/appellees Washington Hospital Center Corporation and Dr. Scott Muangman, alleging medical malpractice-negligence (Count I) and negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count II). The trial court dismissed Count II after defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss that count.\nOn February 14, 2005, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because Miller-McGee had no expert witness who would testify in the case, she would be unable as a matter of law to establish the standard of care, a breach thereof, and proximate causation. On April 11, 2005, the trial court issued its order dismissing the negligent delivery claim. Noting that Miller-McGee contended that her injuries were caused by her child having been delivered forcibly with forceps, the court found that there was no question that expert testimony would have been required to determine the standard of care and to establish what constituted the proper use of force in the delivery of a child. As to Miller-McGee\u2019s theory that appellees failed to obtain her informed consent to the assisted vaginal delivery that was performed, the court stated, \u201c[wjhile Plaintiffs complaint fails to mention a lack of informed consent it is the Court\u2019s understanding that Defendants had notice of this theory, as evident by their Interrogatory Requests of Plaintiff.... Defendants were further put on notice of this theory during the deposition of Defendant Muangman, if not earlier.\u201d The court also found that an \u201cexpert opinion was not necessary for the Plaintiffs claim of lack of informed consent.\u201d Accordingly, the court\u2019s April 11, 2005 order granted only partial summary judgment to defendants, stating that \u201c[pjlaintiff may go forward with the lack of informed consent issue only.\u201d\nOn April 28, 2005, defendants/appellees filed another motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, asserting that Miller-McGee had not pled a claim of lack of informed consent in either her original or amended complaint and had not sought leave of court to amend her complaint a second time to add such a claim, and arguing that her \u201cfailure to amend her complaint to allege Lack of Informed Consent is fatal.\u201d Defendants/appellees also asserted that Miller-McGee \u201ccannot prove her claim of Lack of Informed Consent as a matter of law.\u201d Defendants/appellees argued, and contend again in this appeal, that:\nEven if this Court could allow a late amendment, Plaintiff cannot prove that the risk of laceration is a material risk and that there was a viable alternative to an assisted vaginal delivery. Moreover, Plaintiff cannot prove that had she been informed of the risk of vaginal laceration, she would not have consented to the assisted vaginal delivery of her child. As demonstrated by the testimony of Defendants\u2019 expert witness, upon whom Plaintiff intends to rely to support her claim of Lack of Informed Consent, an expectant mother is not routinely given the option of a caesarian section. There must be a medical indication for surgery. In this case a caesarian section was not medically indicated. Therefore, the risk of laceration, and more specifically, rectovaginal tear, was not considered to be a material risk.... Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot prove that the risk of laceration was a material risk and that had she been so advised, she would not have consented to the assisted vaginal delivery of her child.\nIn opposing the motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, Miller-MeGee submitted an affidavit in which she stated that:\nImmediately prior to the delivery of my child at Washington Hospital Center, the birth of my child was discussed and I was specifically advised that because of the size of my unborn child, if there were any complications during the natural delivery process, a caesarian section would be performed. Because a caesarian was a real possibility, I was told that I needed to execute a consent form for that procedure prior to beginning the delivery as it may have needed to be performed without delay. As a result of my discussions, I was led to believe that I would either have a normal delivery or if complications arose, I would have a caesarian birth. At no time did anyone discuss a vaginally assisted birth with me, and at no time did anyone discuss with me the possibility of a recto-vaginal tear that could result from a vaginally assisted birth. No one advised me that as a result of a recto-vaginal tear that I could potentially lose control of my bowels and have uncontrollable bowel movements from my vagina. Had anyone informed me of this possibility, I would have vehemently objected to a vaginally assisted birth especially since I had already agreed to a caesarian if any complications arose during the delivery process.\nMiller-MeGee also attached to her opposition a copy of her responses to defendants\u2019/appellees\u2019 interrogatories, in which she stated that she did \u201cnot have any specific discussions with anyone regarding the risks, benefits and alternatives of a vaginal delivery.\u201d\nOn September 30, 2005, the court granted defendants\u2019/appellants\u2019 motion. Considering matters outside the pleadings and therefore treating the motion as a motion for summary judgment, the court stated that:\n[T]he Complaint did not state a claim for lack of informed consent. While defendants were put on notice, sometime afterward, of the \u201clegal theory,\u201d the Plaintiff never formally amended the claim, nor sought leave from this Court to make the amendment even after the court\u2019s last ruling. Therefore, the issue is not now properly before this Court and should be dismissed.\nThe court did not reach defendants\u2019 contention that Miller-McGee\u2019s claim would fail as a matter of law, explaining that:\nThe Court has already determined that it lacks jurisdiction for the claim of lack of informed consent because it was never pled. Therefore, the Court finds no reason, at this time, to make a legal determination as to whether the claim would have failed as a matter of law.\nThis appeal followed.\nAnalysis\nFor the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment to defendants without affording Miller-MeGee an opportunity to amend her complaint to include a claim of lack of informed consent to the assisted vaginal delivery.\nI.\nMiller-MeGee acknowledges that her amended complaint does not use the words \u201cinformed consent.\u201d She argues, however, that her complaint \u201cclearly alleges medical negligence, and lack of informed consent is a form of medical negligence,\u201d and she urges us to construe Count I of the amended complaint (\u201cMedical Malpractice-Negligence\u201d) as broad enough to state a claim of lack of informed consent. Appellant\u2019s argument is not without support in our case law. Our cases hold that, on appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we \u201cmust construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d Haymon v. Wilkerson, 535 A.2d 880, 882 (D.C.1987). We have also recognized that our \u201cliberal rules of pleading normally protect a plaintiff against dismissal of an ambiguous complaint when it can be said to state a claim if all reasonable inferences are drawn in plaintiffs favor.\u201d Atraqchi, 788 A.2d at 563 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Furthermore, as appellant argues, there is a basis in our case law for treating a claim of lack of informed consent as a medical malpractice claim. See Crain v. Allison, 443 A.2d 558, 563-64 (D.C.1982). And while, in our opinion, in Wagner v. Georgetown Univ. Med. Ctr., 768 A.2d 546, 558 (D.C.2001), we held that a claim of lack of informed consent related back to a claim of medical negligence \u2014 thereby signaling that the two were separate claims \u2014 we arguably left open the question of whether the claim of lack of informed consent might reasonably be regarded as subsumed within the complaint\u2019s \u201cgeneral allegation of unspecified negligence in [plaintiffs] care and treatment.\u201d Id. at 557 n. 14. Elsewhere, however, as appellees emphasize, we have pointedly distinguished between claims sounding in medical negligence and claims of lack of informed consent. See, e.g., Cleary v. Group Health Ass\u2019n, 691 A.2d 148, 155 (D.C.1997) (distinguishing allegations of negligence in conveying inaccurate medical information from a claim of failure to obtain informed consent).\nWe decline to decide the narrow issue of whether the non-specific allegations pertaining to \u201cmedical malpractice-negligence\u201d in Miller-McGee\u2019s amended complaint were sufficient to state a claim of lack of informed consent. We conclude instead that, taken together, our liberal pleading rules and the procedural history of this case provided a basis upon which Miller-McGee could reasonably regard her amended complaint as having sufficiently pled a claim of lack of informed consent. As we have already described, the relevant procedural history is the April 11, 2005 order, by which the court explicitly permitted Miller-McGee to \u201cgo forward with the lack of informed consent issue\u201d while specifically recognizing that \u201cPlaintiffs complaint fails to mention a lack of informed consent.\u201d In addition, as we explain below, the record shows that defendants/ap-pellees were put on notice of the claim of lack of informed consent during the discovery period. We can discern no reason why it would not have been appropriate for the court to afford Miller-McGee an opportunity to amend her pleadings to conform them to the theory of liability that had emerged during discovery. For all these reasons, we conclude that dismissal of Miller-McGee\u2019s suit with prejudice was too severe a result.\nWe have recognized that \u201cSuper. Ct. Civ. R. 15 provides that leave to amend a complaint shall be given freely when justice requires,\u201d Epps, 454 A.2d at 324-25, and that \u201cleave to amend should be given freely \u2018in the absence of any apparent or declared reason\u2019 for not permitting amendment.\u201d Id. at 325 (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962)); see also Pannell v. District of Columbia, 829 A.2d 474, 477 (D.C.2003) (referring to the \u201cvirtual presumption that leave to amend should be granted unless there are sound reasons for denying it\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Reasons that may justify denying leave to amend are \u201cundue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies [and] futility of amendment.\u201d Epps, 454 A.2d at 325 (citing Foman, 371 U.S. at 182, 83 S.Ct. 227).\nThe record in this case presents none of the reasons (and the trial court made no findings as to any reasons) that we have said justify denial of leave to amend. Because Miller-McGee\u2019s amended complaint at least arguably encompassed a claim of lack of informed consent, we cannot find that she unduly delayed by never seeking leave to amend her complaint to add a more definite statement of that claim. Similarly, we see no evidence of bad faith or dilatory motive or repeated failure to cure deficiencies. This is not a case in which the plaintiff failed to state a cognizable claim despite successive amendments, see note 2 supra, such that leave to amend might have encouraged, or appeared to sanction, efforts to delay an inevitable dismissal. There also is no apparent reason why an amendment to add lack of informed consent to the complaint as a new theory of recovery would have occasioned delay or prejudice, because it seems clear that the lack of informed consent claim rests on the same set of facts alleged in the existing amended complaint. The partial deposition transcripts and interrogatory responses that are part of the record on appeal show that, during discovery, counsel explored the facts that bear on the claim of lack of informed consent. As the trial court found, the discovery put appellees on notice of the informed consent issue, and the parties have not asserted that an amendment of the complaint to add a claim of lack of informed consent would necessitate further discovery. And, as we discuss further infra, an amendment would not have been futile, as it is not \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim which would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d Fingerhut v. Children\u2019s Nat\u2019l Med. Ctr., 738 A.2d 799, 803 (D.C.1999) (citation and quotation omitted).\nThus, it appears that if Miller-McGee had sought leave of court to amend her complaint to add allegations relating to lack of informed consent even before the court issued its April 11, 2005 order, the court would have abused its discretion in denying her leave to amend. See, e.g., Crowley v. N. Am. Telecomms. Ass\u2019n, 691 A.2d 1169, 1174 (D.C.1997) (where omission in complaint could be remedied readily without prejudice to defendant and there was no cogent reason to deny a request for leave to amend, court abused its discretion in denying request). Miller-McGee opposed dismissal of her action, relying in part on the court\u2019s April 11, 2005 ruling, but she did not request leave to amend her complaint, so the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in not sua sponte affording her an opportunity to amend to avoid dismissal. In some circumstances, we have found an abuse of discretion where the trial court dismissed a complaint \u201cwithout inquiring whether [plaintiff] would seek leave to amend.... \u201d Epps, 454 A.2d at 325. Nevertheless, the prevalent rule seems to be that \u201c[ajbsent exceptional circumstances, a [trial] court has no obligation to invite a plaintiff to amend his or her complaint when the plaintiff has not sought such amendment.\u201d Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 242. Ordinarily, the decision whether to grant leave to amend is \u201csquarely within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Postmasters of the United States v. Hyatt Regency Wash., 894 A.2d 471, 477 (D.C.2006).\nWe conclude here, however, that the \u201cprocedural history ... lift[ed] this case out of the realm of the ordinary,\u201d Prudhomme v. Tenneco Oil Co., 955 F.2d 390, 393 (5th Cir.1992), and created an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d that required the court to afford Miller-McGee an opportunity to amend her complaint once the court determined that the complaint was deficient. Because a reasonable interpretation of the April 11, 2005 order was that no further amendment to the complaint was needed to keep the lack of informed consent claim alive, Miller-McGee\u2019s failure to request leave to amend can fairly be regarded as \u201ccourt induced prejudicial inaction,\u201d Prudhomme, 955 F.2d at 394, that cabined the court\u2019s discretion. In this circumstance, the court\u2019s departure from its initial ruling about whether the claim could go forward \u2014 without at least affording Miller-McGee a reasonable time within which to amend her complaint \u2014 was \u201cfundamentally unfair and unreasonable\u201d and \u201cthe very stuff of which abuse of discretion is made.\u201d Id. at 395.\nII.\nAppellees urge us, in the event that we conclude that Miller-McGee\u2019s failure to amend her complaint did not warrant dismissal, to reach the issue that the trial court did not reach, i.e., the issue of whether, on the undisputed facts of record, summary judgment was warranted because the lack of informed consent claim would fail as a matter of law. We go on to consider that issue because, as our discussion above indicates, it is pertinent to whether it would have been futile to afford Miller-McGee an opportunity to amend her complaint. We begin by summarizing what a plaintiff must prove to establish liability for failure to obtain informed consent.\nOur case law on lack of informed consent recognizes the \u201cduty of a physician to inform the patient of the consequences of a proposed treatment,\u201d a duty that \u201cstems from the right of every competent adult human being to determine what shall be done with his own body.\u201d Crain, 443 A.2d at 561; see also Canterbury v. Spence, 150 U.S.App. D.C. 263, 271, 464 F.2d 772, 780 (1972). \u201cIn order to prevail in an action based on a theory of informed consent, the plaintiff must prove that if he had been informed of the material risk, he would not have consented to the procedure and that he had been injured as a result of submitting to the procedure.\u201d Cleary, 691 A.2d at 155 (internal quotations and citation omitted); see also Anderson v. Jones, 606 A.2d 185, 188 (D.C. 1992). Adhering to the rationale of Canterbury, we have said that:\nThe test for mandatory disclosure of information on treatment of the patient\u2019s condition is whether a reasonable person in what the physician knows or should know to be the patient\u2019s position would consider the information material to his decision. The information is material if the reasonable person in what the physician knows or should know to be the patient\u2019s position would be likely to attach significance to the risks in deciding to accept or forego the proposed treatment. ... [A]t a minimum, a physician must disclose the nature of the condition, the nature of the proposed treatment, any alternate treatment procedures, and the nature and degree of risks and benefits inherent in undergoing and in abstaining from the proposed treatment.\nCrain, 443 A.2d at 562. \u201c[N]ot all risks need be disclosed; only material risks must be disclosed.\u201d Id. Thus, to recover on a claim of lack of informed consent, a plaintiff must prove that there was an undisclosed risk that was material; that the risk materialized, injuring plaintiff; and that plaintiff would not have consented to the procedure if she had been informed of the risk. A material risk is a risk \u201cwhich a reasonable person would consider significant in deciding whether to undergo a particular medical treatment.\u201d Abbey v. Jackson, 483 A.2d 330, 332 (D.C.1984).\nThere must be expert testimony to establish some of the elements of proof. See Cleary, 691 A.2d at 153-54. In general, expert testimony is \u201c \u2018required to establish the nature of the risks inherent in a particular treatment, the probabilities of therapeutic success, the frequency of the occurrence of particular risks, the nature of available alternatives to treatment and whether or not disclosure would be detrimental to a patient.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Sard v. Hardy, 281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014, 1024 (1977)). But a plaintiff \u201c \u2018can establish a prima facie case of lack of informed consent through the expert testimony of defendant physicians and defense witnesses without calling independent experts.\u2019 \u201d Tavakoli-Nouri, 745 A.2d at 942 n. 2 (D.C.2000) (quoting Abbey, 483 A.2d at 333). Issues \u201cnot requiring expert testimony typically ask a jury to determine whether an unrevealed risk materialized, whether the physician told the patient about that risk, and whether the physician should have known that knowledge of that risk might affect the patient\u2019s decision.\u201d Cleary, 691 A.2d at 155.\nHere, the trial court had before it evidence (discussed on the transcript pages of Dr. Muangman\u2019s deposition that were attached to appellant\u2019s opposition to appel-lees\u2019 motion for dismissal) that \u201cduring the process of delivery, there was a tear of the mother\u2019s perineum that extended through the rectal sphincter and rectal mucosa\u201d (i.e., \u201cthe lining of the rectum\u201d and \u201cthe muscle that\u2019s involved in controlling [fecal] continence\u201d), and that appellant had a \u201cfourth degree perennial [sic] laceration delivery,\u201d a degree of laceration that involves the rectal sphincter and rectal mucosa. In their briefs submitted to this court, appellees do not dispute that appellant sustained an injury caused by the delivery of her child, but assert that their own experts \u201cwill not testify that vaginal laceration was a material risk in this case.\u201d Appellees also contend that Miller-MeGee cannot prove, without an expert of her own, that a rectovaginal tear is a material risk from an assisted vaginal delivery. However, on the issue of whether an extensive laceration was a risk of an assisted vaginal delivery, it appears that appellant will be able to rely on the testimony of appellees or their experts. For example, during his deposition, appellee Dr. Muang-man testified that an assisted vaginal delivery \u201cdoes lead to an increased risk of tears\u201d and that \u201cthe tear is definitely a risk factor for developing into a rectovagi-nal fistula.\u201d Indeed, he maintains that he told Miller-MeGee about the \u201cpossibility of a perineal tear.\u201d We note, in addition, that appellant\u2019s brief opposing summary judgment asserted that one of appellees\u2019 experts, Dr. Lee Smith, Director of the Section of Colon and Rectal Surgery at Washington Hospital Center, testified that \u201c25% of the patients that he sees with tears involved 4th degree tears,\u201d and that the most common reason is childbirth.\nOn the issue of whether the risk of an extensive vaginal tear was material, appellees rely on the affidavit of their expert, Dr. Donald Chambers, who states that in his opinion \u201cthe risk of laceration during delivery was not a material risk in Plaintiff\u2019s case because a caesarian section was not medically indicated\u201d (italics added). However, the rule in this jurisdiction is that once there has been expert testimony regarding the likelihood of the injury, materiality \u2014 i.e., whether a risk is a material risk \u2014 is an issue for the fact-finder. See Canterbury, 150 U.S.App. D.C. at 279, 464 F.2d at 788 (\u2018Whenever nondisclosure of particular risk information is open to debate by reasonable-minded men, the issue is for the finder of the facts.\u201d), and 150 U.S.App. D.C. at 288, 464 F.2d at 792 (\u201cExperts are unnecessary to a showing of the materiality of a risk to a patient\u2019s decision on treatment, or to the reasonably, expectable effect of risk disclosure on the decision.\u201d); see also Kissinger v. Lofgren, 836 F.2d 678, 681 (1st Cir.1988) (remote or unforeseeable risks are immaterial as a matter of law, but once there is testimony that the injury is a known risk, it is \u201c \u2018the jury\u2019s responsibility to decide whether that peril was of sufficient magnitude to bring the disclosure duty into play \u201d) (quoting Canterbury, 150 U.S.App. D.C. at 285, 464 F.2d at 794). Thus, it is not Dr. Chambers\u2019 or any other expert\u2019s role \u2014 but instead the role of the jury \u2014 to say whether the known risks of vaginal laceration and of a rectovaginal fistula were sufficiently material that there was a duty to disclose them to appellant.\nFinally, appellees argue that Miller-McGee cannot prove that she would have withheld consent to an assisted vaginal delivery if she had been informed of the risk of sustaining an extensive vaginal laceration. They imply that appellant would have had no choice but to consent, because appellees\u2019 own experts would \u201cnot testify that a caesarian was a viable alternative.\u201d In the trial court, appellees relied on the affidavit of Dr. Chambers, who stated that \u201ca caesarian section was not medically indicated in Plaintiffs case\u201d; that a c-section \u201cis not offered to a patient as an alternative to vaginal delivery or assisted vaginal delivery unless for some reason surgery is medically necessary\u201d; and that \u201c[o]nly when a caesarian is medically indicated, is it considered to be an alternative.\u201d However, the record before us also includes Dr. Muangman\u2019s deposition testimony that \u201c[i]t was my opinion that, given the station of the baby\u2019s head and the different delivery options, that the option that would have gotten the baby delivered the most expeditiously was the assisted vaginal delivery, which the patient did agree to\u201d (italics added). Thus, on this factual record, we cannot say that appellant could not prove that had she known of the risk of a rectovaginal f\u00edstula, she could have and would have opted for some method of delivery other than a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery.\nFurthermore, appellees\u2019 argument that a c-section was not an alternative for appellant because \u201ca c-section is not offered to a patient as an alternative to vaginal delivery or assisted vaginal delivery unless for some reason surgery is medically necessary\u201d (italics added) suggests that professional custom or practice alone may dictate whether the obstetrical patient has an alternative. That suggestion is incorrect as a matter of law. As the District of Columbia Circuit admonished in Canterbury, the patient\u2019s cause of action for lack of informed consent is not \u201cdependent upon the existence and nonperformance of a relevant professional tradition.\u201d Canterbury, 150 U.S.App. D.C. at 274, 464 F.2d at 783. That is because \u201cto bind the disclosure obligation to medical usage is to arrogate the decision on revelation to the physician alone.\u201d Id. at 275, 464 F.2d at 784. \u201cRespect for the patient\u2019s right of self-determination on particular therapy demands a standard set by law for physicians rather than one which physicians may or may not impose upon themselves.\u201d Id.\nWe note that courts in some other jurisdictions have specifically held that the duty of informed consent requires a physician to inform an obstetrical patient about a cesarean section as an option even if the physician does not believe that it is medically necessary, and even if the physician himself or herself would not offer to perform the cesarean section. See Harrison v. United States, 284 F.3d 293, 301-02 (1st Cir.2002) (reasoning that \u201cit is the patient\u2019s prerogative to balance [the] risks and choose the form of treatment that best meets the patient\u2019s needs,\u201d reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment that the doctor was under no duty to afford the patient the opportunity to have a cesarean section, and holding that \u201cbecause there are only two methods of childbirth, if the district court finds the risk of vaginal birth to be material to the patient, then [the doctor] had a duty to present the alternative option of a C-section that might minimize such risk, regardless of his medical opinion on the proper course of treatment.\u201d); Harrison v. United States, 233 F.Supp.2d 128, 134 (D.Mass.2002) (noting that the \u201cvery purpose of informed consent [is] empowerment of the patient,\u201d and holding that \u201cbecause there are only two methods of childbirth, once there is a material risk to vaginal birth, the doctor\u2019s duty to disclose that risk also encompasses the duty to present information about C-sections\u201d); Schreiber v. Physicians Ins. Co. of Wis., 223 Wis.2d 417, 588 N.W.2d 26 (1999) (holding that where patient in labor informed doctor that she wanted to abandon the plan to which she had previously consented to have a vaginal birth, and to have a cesarean section instead, and doctor \u201cknew that the cesarian delivery was a viable medical option but did not consider it to be medically indicated,\u201d doctor nonetheless had an obligation to conduct a new informed consent discussion and afford the patient the opportunity for a choice of treatment, and rejecting \u201cthe notion that the onset of a procedure categorically forecloses a patient\u2019s withdrawal of consent\u201d); Bankert v. United States, 937 F.Supp. 1169, 1184 (D.Md.1996) (holding, in a case in which the physician refused the patient\u2019s request for a cesarean delivery and decided to proceed with a trial of labor, that although the doctor \u201cexercised his medical judgment and determined that cesarean delivery was not medically indicated, he nevertheless denied [plaintiff] the right to withdraw her consent to a particular medical procedure, and he denied her the opportunity to exercise her personal autonomy to make decisions regarding her own body\u201d and thereby violated her right to informed consent); see also Villanueva v. Harrington, 80 Wash.App. 36, 906 P.2d 374, 377 n. 9 (1995) (remanding for trial suit in which patient alleged that physician had not obtained her informed consent for a forceps-assisted delivery, and noting testimony describing alternatives to forceps-assisted delivery); Gordon v. Bakare, 38 Pa. D. & C.4th 388, 392 (Pa. Common Pleas 1998) (allowing plaintiff to go forward with suit claiming that her doctor did not discuss with her the surgical alternative to a forceps-assisted delivery); Canterbury, 150 U.S.App. D.C. at 272, 464 F.2d at 781 (\u201c[I]t is the prerogative of the patient, not the physician, to determine for himself the direction in which his interests seem to he.\u201d).\nWe cannot tell from the record here whether a cesarean section would have been one of the options for Miller-McGee given the specific complications that developed with her delivery and the time pressures that surrounded it. Among other things, it is not clear to us whether Dr. Muangman\u2019s testimony that a cesarean section was \u201cnot medically indicated\u201d means that a cesarean section would not have been feasible or viable for whatever reason, or that Dr. Muangman would not have been willing to perform one, or that a cesarean section was not necessary, or something else. We conclude only that, on the record as it stands before us, it is not a foregone conclusion that Miller-McGee would not have been able to prove, without an expert of her own, that there was an alternative to a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery, and that a reasonable person in her place would have chosen that alternative if informed of the risks that an assisted delivery presents.\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the dismissal of the lack of informed consent cause of action and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nSo ordered.\n. A rectovaginal f\u00edstula is \"an abnormal passage or communication ... between the rectum and vagina.\u201d Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 506 (26th ed. 1981).\n. It appears from the Superior Court docket sheet that Miller-McGee filed an original complaint on September 2, 2003, but never served that original complaint, and that ap-pellees\u2019 first responsive pleadings were their answers to appellant\u2019s amended complaint.\n.In Count I of the amended complaint, Miller-McGee alleged that defendants owed her \"the duty of providing appropriate diagnosis, care and treatment in accordance with the standard of care utilized by those of average knowledge and skill in the field of medicine,\u201d and that defendants' \"failure to provide appropriate diagnoses and treatment constituted negligence and was the cause of the massive vaginal tear which she suffered and is the cause of the extreme pain, suffering and embarrassment experienced throughout a two year period of her life.\u201d Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.\n. Miller-McGee had designated an expert after the court extended the time for discovery, but the expert was never made available for a deposition, and eventually the court granted defendants\u2019 unopposed motion to strike the expert.\n. Because the court\u2019s September 30, 2005 order granted summary judgment, our standard of review is de novo. See Joeckel v. Disabled Am. Veterans, 793 A.2d 1279, 1281 (D.C.2002); see also Atraqchi v. GUMC Unified Billing Servs., 788 A.2d 559, 562 (D.C. 2002) (reviewing de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim).\n. Moreover, \u201c '[t]he Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure manifest a preference for resolution of disputes on the merits, not on technicalities of pleading.\u2019 \u201d Epps v. Vogel, 454 A.2d 320, 325 n. 8 (D.C.1982) (quoting Keith v. Washington, 401 A.2d 468, 470 (D.C.1979)).\n. We observed in Crain:\nAppellees testified that appellants failed to warn them of the risk of infection associated with cortisone injections before embarking on that course of treatment. We agree that the jury could find this was a material risk. Mrs. Allison testified that she would not have agreed to the injections had she been aware of the risk of infection. In fact, Mrs. Allison's finger did become infected as a result of the treatment, and Mrs. Allison suffered pain from the infection. Although there was no expert testimony on the standard of care of a physician in obtaining informed consent from his patients, there was expert testimony on the actual risks involved. Thus, appellees established a pri-ma facie case of medical malpractice.\n443 A.2d at 563-64 (italics added).\n.Our discussion in Wagner was premised on the specificity of plaintiff's other allegations of negligence (\"defendants\u2019 alleged failures during surgery to monitor Mrs. Wagner\u2019s vital signs, to control her bleeding, to replenish her lost blood volume, and to maintain her blood pressure,\u201d 768 A.2d at 551 n. 5), and did not address her more general allegation that the defendants were \"otherwise negligent.\u201d Id. at 551.\n. For example, the following exchange took place between Miller-McGee\u2019s counsel and appellee Dr. Muangman during Muangman\u2019s deposition:\nQ: Okay. And so would I be understanding you correctly to say that you told her about the possibility of a perineal tear?\nA: Yes, that\u2019s part of my counseling.\nQ: Okay, but what I\u2019m asking you is, did you inform her that she could develop a rectovaginal \u2014 she could get a rectovagi-nal tear from the vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery?\nA: I don\u2019t recall that.\n.The following observations that we made in Wagner v. Georgetown Univ. Med. Ctr. are pertinent here as well:\nAny competent lawyer defending a physician accused of performing surgery in a negligent manner would investigate not only the narrow issue of how the surgery weis conducted, but also the facts and circumstances surrounding the surgery, including the events leading up to it. Whether or not an informed consent claim had been asserted, communications between physician and patient prior to the surgery would be a prime subject of inquiry. Defense counsel would need to learn what the physician said in obtaining the patient\u2019s consent to the surgery, because counsel would need to know, for example, whether the physician said anything \u2014 e.g., about the condition of the patient, the surgery to be performed, or the risks involved \u2014 that could be evidence of negligence on the physician\u2019s part. Thus, even if the original complaint in this case did not mention lack of informed consent specifically, that complaint was nonetheless calculated to cause counsel for [defendants] to focus on the facts that would underlie such a claim as a routine part of defense preparation.\nId., 768 A.2d at 557-58; see also Rainer v. Buena Cmty. Mem. Hosp., 18 Cal.App.3d 240, 254, 95 Cal.Rptr. 901 (Cal.Ct.App.1971) (\"Where additional investigation and discovery is not required to meet the new issue, it would appear that it would constitute an abuse of discretion not to permit the amendment of a complaint [to add a claim of lack of informed consent] even at the outset of a trial, where the amendment merely adds a new theory of recovery on the same set of facts constituting the cause of action.\u201d).\n. This case is readily distinguishable from cases that appellees have cited to us, involving trial court decisions denying leave to amend to add claims that had never been foreshadowed before the close of discovery or before entry of the pre-trial order. See, e.g., Woodland v. District Council 20, 777 A.2d 795, 799 (D.C.2001) (FMLA claim was never stated with sufficient clarity in any of plaintiff\u2019s pleadings in the trial court); Lowe's Home Ctrs., Inc. v. Olin Corp., 313 F.3d 1307, 1314 (11th Cir.2002) (after close of discovery, plaintiff could not add new claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation to claim of negligent design and supervision); Speer v. Rand McNally & Co., 123 F.3d 658, 665 (7th Cir.1997) (plaintiff had not raised her claim even in her deposition); Moore v. West, 991 F.Supp. 11, 12 n. 1 (D.D.C.1998) (motion to amend was raised for the first time in plaintiff's proposed findings); Zimmerman v. Robertson, 259 Mont. 105, 854 P.2d 338, 342 (1993) (plaintiff failed to raise claim both in pleadings and in pre-trial order); Mahan v. Bethesda Hosp., Inc., 84 Ohio App.3d 520, 617 N.E.2d 714, 718-19 (1992) (additional claim was raised for first time on the fourth day of trial and there was nothing in the record as to what the evidence would be).\n. We are not foreclosed from considering whether leave to amend should have been granted on the ground that Miller-McGee filed her appeal to this court without\nseeking] amendment after the dismissal by moving for reconsideration or relief from the judgment. A dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment that slams the door shut on the possibility of future amendments to the complaint unless the judgment is set aside or vacated pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule 60.... Motions for post-judgment relief and direct appeal thus provide two separate avenues through which a plaintiff may challenge the dismissal of a complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend.\nU.S. ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., 360 F.3d 220, 242 n. 30 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks, citation, and editing omitted).\n. See also Pellerin v.1915 16th St. N.W. Coop. Ass\u2019n, 900 A.2d 683, 688 (D.C.2006) (\"Even though [plaintiff] did not formally move for leave to amend her complaint to assert that new claim, but instead merely included it at the eleventh hour in the Joint Pretrial Statement, precedent in this jurisdiction teaches that the trial court still was obliged to consider whether to allow it.\u201d (citing Lonon v.

Dec. 13, 2006) (\"Because the District Court did not find Plaintiffs' claims to be entirely frivolous on their face, we conclude that the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion in dismissing the action without affording Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend.\u201d).\n. In Prudhomme, the trial court had ordered dismissal of a proposed amended complaint that would have added a strict liability claim. Thereafter, on the eve of trial, the court announced that it would permit plaintiff to try the strict liability claim, to the prejudice of defendants, which had forgone any preparation to defend against that claim and were \u201clulled into preparing to defend against ... alleged negligence only.\u201d 955 F.2d at 395. The Fifth Circuit held that these facts required reversal of the verdict against defendants, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion in the management of its docket and the trial of lawsuits pending before it,\u201d id. at 392, because the \"court misled [defendant] and induced prejudicial inaction.\u201d Id. at 395; see also Lockhart v.

Gunther, 745 A.2d 939, 942 n. 1 (D.C.2000).\n. \"A physician is relieved of his duty to inform his patient (1) in an emergency situation when the patient is incapable of consent, no relative or guardian can be obtained to give the necessary consent to the treatment, and imminent harm from non-treatment outweighs any harm threatened by the proposed treatment; and (2) when the physician reasonably believes that the patient\u2019s reaction to the risk information will pose a threat to the patient\u2019s well being.\u201d Crain, 443 A.2d at 562-63.\n. The apparent absence of dispute as to causation distinguishes the instant case from Gordon v. Neviaser, 478 A.2d 292, 296 (D.C. 1984), in which we upheld a directed verdict for the defendant where the plaintiff had no expert testimony that the condition of his shoulder had deteriorated as a result of surgery on the shoulder.\n. By contrast, as noted supra, Miller-MeGee states in her affidavit that \u201c[a]t no time did anyone discuss a vaginally assisted birth with me, and at no time did anyone discuss with me the possibility of a recto-vaginal tear that could result from a vaginally assisted birth,\u201d and that she \"did not have any discussion with Dr, Muangman regarding risks, benefits and alternatives of a vaginal delivery.\u201d Whether Dr. Muangman disclosed the risks attendant to an assisted vaginal delivery and did so adequately is a jury question. See Crain, 443 A.2d at 564 (\"[T]he jury could fairly conclude from the evidence that warnings were not given or, if given, were unreasonably inadequate under the circumstances.\u201d); see also Tavakoli-Nouri, 745 A.2d at 942 (\"[Qjuestions of credibility involving whether an individual had been informed of risks and alternatives to a medical procedure are traditionally within the province of the jury.\u201d) (citing Eibl v. Kogan, 494 A.2d 640, 642 n. 2 (D.C.1985)).\n.See generally Barbara L. Atwell, The Modem Age of Informed Consent, 40 U. Rich. L.Rev. 591, 596-97 (2006) (noting that the case law establishes that \"whether or not adequate information has been given to the patient must be determined from the viewpoint of the reasonable patient-not the viewpoint of the medical professional.\u201d).\n.In Canterbury, the court found that when it was established \u201cthat paralysis can be expected in one percent of laminectomies,\u201d the evidence that the doctor \"did not reveal the risk of paralysis from the laminectomy made out a prima facie case of violation of the physician's duty to disclose,\u201d and it became \"the jury's responsibility to decide whether that peril was of sufficient magnitude to bring the disclosure duty into play.\u201d 150 U.S.App.D.C. at 270, 285, 464 F.2d at 779, 794; see also id. at 150 U.S.App.D.C. at 279 n. 86, 464 F.2d at 788 n. 86, and accompanying text (noting that a \"very small chance of death or serious disablement may well be significant,\u201d and collecting cases referencing percentage chances of injury and determining whether disclosure of the risk was required).\n. The actual test is \"what would a prudent person in the patient's position have decided if informed of all relevant factors.\u201d Crain, 443 A.2d at 563 n. 14. \"Although the patient's testimony is relevant on the issue of causation, the test of causation is objective.\u201d Id.\n. See Canterbury, 150 U.S.App. D.C. at 281, 464 F.2d at 790 (\"The patient obviously has no complaint if he would have submitted to the therapy notwithstanding awareness that the risk was one of its perils.\u201d).\n. Appellees' argument below \u2014 that \"[t]he alternative to a vaginal delivery is a cesarian section delivery which is premised solely on medical parameters and cannot be offered to a patient for lay purposes\u201d and that \u201c[a] patient cannot opt, simply because she desires a cesarian section delivery over a vaginal delivery, for no medically substantiated basis\u201d \u2014 is similarly defective.\nWe note, tangentially, that a November 2004 Kaiser Family Foundation report available at http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily\u2014 reports/rep \u2014 index.c&n?hint=2 & DR\u2014 ID=26854, states that \u201cThe rate of caesarean-section delivery among U.S. women with uncomplicated pregnancies and no medical reason for a surgical delivery increased 67% between 1991 and 2001.\u201d The report refers to statements by researchers \"that more study is needed to determine [ ] whether the risk of an elective c-section could be offset by the potential benefits of avoiding a vaginal delivery.\u201d\n. In its Harrison decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit emphasized, \"so as not to unduly burden the practice of medicine,\u201d that the physician\u2019s duty to disclose does not necessarily mean that the doctor must offer to perform a cesarean section if the doctor does not consider one to be warranted in his medical judgment. 284 F.3d at 302 n. 8. The Harrison trial court further explained that a doctor cannot escape liability for breach of informed consent merely by arguing that he himself would have been unwilling to perform the alternate procedure about which he failed to inform the patient. See 233 F.Supp.2d at 134 (\"Once a doctor has informed a patient about alternatives, the patient can then make her own assessment and seek out medical care that is in accordance with her decision.\u201d).\n.See Suzanne K. Ketler, The Rebirth of Informed Consent: A Cultural Analysis of the Informed Consent Doctrine After Schreiber v. Physicians Ins. Co. of Wisconsin, 95 N.W. L.Rev. 1029 (2001) (discussing the \"contemporary cultural model ... based on the notion that the course of labor and birth is not 'natural' but is in fact the outcome of choices based on rational decision-making guided by the laboring patient,\u201d and noting that the decision in Schreiber, which suggests that \"informed consent is a process rather than an endpoint,\u201d has \"the potential to revitalize the informed consent doctrine and bring it closer to the principles on which it was founded\u201d).\n. We note, for example, that Dr. Muangman testified that he made a determination to expedite delivery to avoid injury to the child, and that he had a conversation with Miller-McGee about this \"while she [was] pushing.\u201d\n. Accordingly, at least at this juncture, we are not called to decide whether an obstetrical patient has a right to elect a c-section delivery if a c-section is a viable option. Thus, we escape a variant of the weighty issue that we faced in In re A.C.: the question of \"who should decide how [a] child should be delivered.\u201d In re A.C., 573 A.2d 1235, 1245 n. 9 (D.C.1990) (enbanc).",

Daewoo Heavy Industries America Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc).\nStepping back for a moment, it is clear to me that the present (amended) complaint does not allege that the doctor proceeded without the patient\u2019s informed consent. Those words do not appear in the complaint, nor is that claim fairly inferred from the words that do appear. See Cleary v. Group Health Ass\u2019n, Inc., 691 A.2d 148, 155 (D.C.1997) (\u201cinformed consent claims concern a duty of the physician which is completely separate and distinct from his responsibility to skillfully diagnose and treat the patient\u2019s ills\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also note 3, supra (quoting from amended complaint). We may have \u201cliberal\u201d rules of pleading, see generally In re Estate of Curseen, 890 A.2d 191 (D.C. 2006), but Civil Rule 8 still requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d Super. Ct. Civ. R. 8(a)(2). The complaint in this case fails even that very lenient test.\nIt is not enough that appellant articulated that theory in discovery. She still is required to plead it, and deposition testimony and answers to interrogatories are not pleadings. See Super. Ct. Civ. R. 7(a). This is not a technicality, but rather a fundamental principle of our rules for conducting civil litigation.\nThe majority acknowledges what it calls \u201cthe prevalent rule,\u201d that \u201c[a]bsent exceptional circumstances, a [trial] court has no obligation to invite a plaintiff to amend his or her complaint when the plaintiff has not sought such amendment.\u201d Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., 360 F.3d 220, 242 (1st Cir.2004). We part company when the majority concludes that \u201cexceptional circumstance[s]\u201d are present here\u2014 that the trial court, in effect, \u201clulled\u201d appellant into complacency. With respect, that conclusion is not fair to the trial court.\nIt is true that the court\u2019s order of April 11, 2005, stated that the plaintiff could \u201cgo forward on the lack of informed consent issue....\u201d This ruling was based on the court\u2019s conclusion that defendants \u201chad notice of this theory\u201d from discovery. If the trial court thereafter had changed its mind sua sponte and dismissed for failure to state a claim, that would have been unfair. But on April 28, 2005, appellees filed a renewed motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment arguing, among other things, that plaintiff was required to plead her claims and that her \u201cfailure to amend her complaint to allege Lack of Informed Consent is fatal.\u201d Appellant responded on June 27, arguing first that appellees had been put on notice of that claim through discovery and also that \u201c[i]n her complaint, the plaintiff clearly alleges medical negligence, and lack of informed [sic] is clearly a form of medical negligence.\u201d Appellant had a full opportunity to brief the issue (and to make any related motions) before the court ruled (correctly, in my view) \u201cthat the Complaint did not state a claim for lack of informed consent.\u201d\nAppellant may have been startled by that ruling, but she cannot claim unfair surprise. She knew her complaint had been attacked for failure to state a claim, and she was not entitled to assume that the trial court would deny the motion. Even if he chose to defend the complaint as drafted, a prudent attorney would have, in the alternative, sought leave to amend if the court ruled otherwise. If he had not taken this precaution, the attorney could have filed a timely motion under Civil Rule 59 or 60, seeking leave to amend. At no time did appellant ask the trial court for leave to amend her complaint, and the trial court was not obliged to invite her to do so. Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 242. See also James Cape & Sons Co. v. PCC Construction Co., 453 F.3d 396, 400-01 (7th Cir. 2006) (rejecting argument that \u201ceven though [plaintiff] did not properly request leave to amend its complaint, the district court was required by Rule 15 to dismiss without prejudice and/or sua sponte grant leave to amend the complaint\u201d).\nUnder the circumstances, it is likely that the plain error standard governs our review instead of the already deferential abuse of discretion standard. I need not resolve that question, however, because the Superior Court neither abused its discretion nor committed plain error by failing to grant relief that was never requested. See Greenidge v. Allstate Insurance Co., 446 F.3d 356, 361 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201ca district court does not abuse its discretion when it fails to grant leave to amend a complaint without being asked to do so\u201d); Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 242 n. 32 (deciding appeal without resolving whether court should review for plain error or abuse of discretion); Em\u00e9rito Estrada Rivera-Isuzu de P.R., Inc. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 233 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir.2000) (pointing out that plaintiff did not amend complaint as of right \u2014 as it could have \u2014 or \u201cformally ask the district court after judgment to permit such an amendment,\u201d citing Rules 59 and 60; \u201cwe cannot say that the district court committed error, let alone plain error, by fading to invite Em\u00e9rito to replead.\u201d).\nI also am skeptical that appellant can prove her belated claim of lack of informed consent without testimony from an expert witness of her own. I would not reach this complicated issue, however, because I would uphold the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint.\nI respectfully dissent.",
