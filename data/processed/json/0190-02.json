The petitioner seeks review of a Superior Court ruling affirming a decision of the Coastal Resources Management Council. The Superior Court justice, after noting his limited powers of review in administrative appeals, stated:\n\"As I indicated earlier, there are few avenues open in view of the statute that governs administrative appeals, and I do not find anything in the record that would authorize the court to grant relief as prayed for by the plaintiff.\u201d\nWe have thoroughly reexamined the petition for certiorari and accompanying exhibits and we find therein no basis for disturbing the conclusion of the Superior Court justice. Therefore, the motion of petitioner requesting that we reconsider our previous denial of certiorari is denied.",
