        "text": "OPINION BY\nMcEWEN, P.J.E.:\n\u00b6 1 Appellant, Douglas DeBoer, appeals from the order, entered pursuant to the Protection From Abuse Act, that, inter alia, \u201ccompletely evicted and excluded\u201d him from the residence of appellee, Charlene Slusser, mother of appellant\u2019s granddaughter, and precluded all contact with appellee except under very limited conditions. We affirm.\n\u00b6 2 While appellee is the mother of appellant\u2019s granddaughter, she was never married to appellant\u2019s son. The record reveals that appellee sought an order of protection against appellant due to his threatening behavior toward her, which included, the trial court found, the fact that appellant had \u201cflashed a gun\u201d at her. Final Order of Court, January 14, 2009, p. 1.\n\u00b6 3 Appellant presents in his brief the sole claim that the trial court erred in entertaining appellee\u2019s petition because the relationship between him and the appellee does not fall within the purview of the Pennsylvania Protection From Abuse Act (hereinafter PFAA or Act), 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6101 et seq.\n\u00b6 4 The PFAA is intended to protect citizens from \u201cabuse\u201d as that term is defined in the statute, and provides:\n\u2022 that \u201c[a]n adult or an emancipated minor may seek relief under this chapter ... by filing a petition with the court alleging abuse by the defendant^]\u201d and\n\u2022 that the trial court \u201cmay grant any protection order or approve any consent agreement to bring about a cessation of abuse [.] \u201d\n23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6106(a), 6108(a) (emphasis supplied). The term abuse is defined in the statute, in relevant part, as follows:\n\u201cAbuse.\u201d The occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members, sexual or intimate partners or persons who share biological parenthood: ... [placing another in reasonable fear of imminent serious bodily injury.\n28 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6102(a) (emphasis supplied). The Act further provides that the phrase \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d includes those \u201cpersons related by consanguinity [i.e. blood] or affinity.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 5 Appellant here argues that the definition of abuse specifically limits the application of the statute to conduct that occurs \u201cbetween family or household members, sexual or intimate partners or persons who share biological parenthood,\u201d and that his relationship to appellee does not fit within any of those described relationships. We disagree. Here, both appellant and appel-lee have a direct blood relationship to the child, and by extension are inextricably linked to each other by that relationship. In fact, the parties are more directly related by consanguinity than the in-law relationship that was deemed adequate to invoke the protection of the Act in McCance v. McCance, 908 A.2d 905, 910 (Pa.Super.2006) (Court interpreted \u201caffinity\u201d to include a family relationship of in-laws). Thus, there is no basis upon which to reverse the decision of the distinguished President Judge Kenneth W. Seamans.\n\u00b6 6 Order affirmed.\n. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6101 etseq.\n. Complainant testified at the evidentiary hearing that appellant \"pulled a gun out of the glove compartment, he showed it to me and said if I don\u2019t let him see my daughter [appellant's granddaughter] or ... take her away from him I know what he can do.\u201d N.T., January 14, 2009, pp. 5-6.\n. The General Assembly has explicitly provided, in specific circumstances, for grandparents to have visitation and or custody rights as to a child. See: 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5313. Moreover, the order in question specifically provided for the possibility of future visitation between appellant and his granddaughter. See: Final Order of Court, January 14, 2009, p. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.",
