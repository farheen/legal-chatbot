    <p id="b1030-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1030.19",1030,[1032,533,753,1787]]]'>¶ 2 The record reveals on February 8, 1999, appellee filed a complaint seeking spousal support and child support for the parties’ two children. A conference was held on March 22, 1999, before the conference officer of the domestic relations section of York County. An order of support was entered on that date directing appellant to pay $38.00 per week for support of the parties’ two children and $48.00 per week for spousal support. Appellant was also directed to pay $43.44 weekly for arrears. On March 29, 1999, appellee filed a Petition for Amendment of Support Order seeking an increase in support for herself and the two children in accordance with the April 1, 1999 amendments to the Support Guidelines. Appellant filed a Demand for Hearing <em>De Novo </em>on April 1, 1999, arguing the March 22, 1999 Order was in error because the conference officer failed to hold appellee to a correct earning capacity, ordered spousal support for which appellant denies liability, and failed to consider a 6% custody arrangement. The Court of Common Pleas of York County scheduled a hearing for June 23, 1999. However, on May 20, 1999, appellant filed a petition for a special hearing averring that because of the complex nature of the case a hearing in excess of the time allotted for a customary support appeal should be scheduled. On May 27, 1999, the trial court granted appellant’s request and scheduled a special support hearing for September 13,1999.</p>

After contacting appellant’s attorney the trial court was informed that appellant’s counsel filed a petition to withdraw the demand for a <em>de novo </em>hearing with the Domestic Relations Section. However, neither appellee nor the trial court were provided with a copy of the petition to withdraw. The court ruled appellant does not have the right to withdraw without permission of the court or agreement of the parties and proceeded to conduct the hearing without the presence of appellant or his attorney. On that date, the trial court issued an order allocating child support in the amount $257.50 per month for each child and spousal support of $263.00 per month. This appeal followed.</p>

The rule simply has no application to the withdrawal of a demand for a hearing <em>de novo </em>on a support issue pending before a trial court. “De novo” review entails, as the term suggests, full consideration of the case anew.
