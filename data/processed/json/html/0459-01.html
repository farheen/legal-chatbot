A jury acquitted defendant of the kidnapping charge but found him guilty of assault, high and aggravated.

Defendant had forced Laliberte to enter an automobile driven by Edward Engermann. Laliberte and defendant sat in the back seat.

While the automobile was moving along Congress <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>Street, Laliberte and defendant began wrestling and in the encounter Laliberte was struck. The defendant took the witness stand and testified that while he was wrestling with Laliberte, Laliberte had pulled out a club from his sleeve. As defendant was striving to wrest the club from Laliberte, Laliberte was struck with it on the forehead. Engermann drove the automobile into a secluded wooded area in the Town of Scarborough (a town immediately adjacent to Portland). All three then emerged from the automobile. Testimony given by Engermann was that Engermann saw defendant strike Laliberte a number of times in the face. Defendant specifically denied this and generally denied that he had ever hit Laliberte intentionally either with the club or with his hands. He testified that Engermann had struck Laliberte in the stomach and stabbed him in the leg with a mechanical corkscrew.</p>

It appears to overlook the point that the jury could reasonably acquit as to “possession”, notwithstanding that the jury had given weight to the fact that there were drugs in defendant’s kitchen. The presence of the drugs in the defendant’s kitchen does not, ipso facto, suffice to establish that defendant “possessed” them; and the jury might have concluded that the other factors necessary to establish “possession” were inadequately shown. Yet, the jury’s recognition that drugs had been found in the defendant’s kitchen could be of material assistance to the jury in reaching a conclusion that defendant participated in a <em>conspiracy </em>to possess the drugs even though he was not in <em>possession </em>of them.</p>
