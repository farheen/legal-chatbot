Employer filed a notice of compensation payable, and Sailman began to receive total disability benefits at the maximum rate of $377.00 per week, based on an average weekly wage of $808.08.</p>

Sailman filed an answer to Employer’s petition denying all material allegations therein. Hearings were conducted and the following relevant evidence was presented to the referee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b214-17" data-blocks='[["BL_214.18",214,[996,1085,758,946]]]'>Sailman introduced the expert testimony of Dr. Larry Kramer and Dr. Corey Ruth who both testified that Sailman was suffering from back strain and from herniated and bulging discs, and that, as a result of those problems, he was unable to return to any type of employment. Employer presented the testimony of Dr. Eric Mitchell who testified that, while Sailman had chronic lumbar strain and sprain, Sailman was nevertheless capable of performing medium level work with the following limitations: lifting from twenty-one to fifty pounds; standing from four to six hours; sitting from five to eight hours; and occasional bending and squatting. Dr. Mitchell proscribed heavy work and testified that Sailman could not perform his pre-injury job. The referee accepted the testimony of Dr. Mitchell and rejected the testimony of Drs. Kramer and Ruth.</p>

The referee found as fact that Sailman failed to respond to three of those jobs in good faith.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The three jobs were as follows: (1) machine shop operator at Ame-tek, Inc.; (2) security guard at Firm Security <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>Systems; and (3) heating mechanic at Jacobs Heating and Air Conditioning Co. The security job with Firm Security Systems was first presented to Sailman on September 7, 1989, and the heating mechanic position at Jacobs Heating was first offered to Sailman on November 8, 1989. While the Ametek position was not offered to Sailman until January 19, 1990, the referee made a specific finding that <em>all three </em>jobs were still available to Sailman on that date.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[150,791,755,371]]]'>The referee, taking the salary level of the Ametek job, the highest paying available job at $12.55 per hour, determined that Sailman had an earning capacity of $502.00 per week. Subtracting $502.00 from his average weekly wage of $808.08, the referee concluded that Sailman had a partial loss of earnings of $306.08.</p>
    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[152,1190,753,372]]]'>On the basis of these underlying facts, the referee granted Employer’s petition for modification as of January 19, 1990, and directed that Sailman’s compensation be reduced to a partial disability rate of $204.05 per week ($808.08 - $502 = $306.08 x 2/3 = $204.05). Sailman appealed to the Board which affirmed the referee. This appeal followed.</p>

In the present case, Sailman does not dispute the referee’s determinations that Employer showed a change in his physical condition, discovered three open positions within his physical limitations, or that his benefits must be modified because he acted in bad faith by failing to apply for those positions. Therefore, it is clear that Employer established its right to modify Sailman’s benefits under <em>Kaehinski.</em>

Two of the jobs, both at Z &amp; L Lumber, became available on March 2,1984; the third job, a telemarketing position with Sears and Roebuck, became available on March 26,1984.

The referee when modifying claimant’s benefits, refused to consider any of the jobs offered to the claimant before September of 1987 on the basis that those jobs were too remote in time to be probative. The referee modified the claimant’s benefits as of September 27, 1987, based on a position available on that date. On appeal, this Court, relying on <em>Associated Plumbing </em>and <em>Barnes and Tucker Co. v.

That distinction is critical because Sailman was able to apply for every available position, including the security job, on the date the referee modified his benefits. In contrast, nothing in <em>Associated Plumbing </em>or <em>Roadway Express </em>even suggests that any of the positions presented to the claimants in those cases remained open and available on the date when their benefits were modified. Therefore, because all three positions were open to Sailman on the date the referee modified his benefits, we hold that the referee could choose among those positions when determining which position to utilize for calculating the reduction of Sailman’s benefits.</p>

      <em>We </em>then must consider whether the referee properly decided to choose the Ame-tek job as a basis for modifying Sailman’s benefits. Because the Ametek position had the highest salary of any of the three positions offered to the Claimant, we do not believe that the referee erred in assuming that Claimant would have chosen that job because it <em>was </em>the highest paying available position. Moreover, the Ametek position was a skilled manufacturing job and was representative of the type of job Employer had been finding for Claimant. <em>See Associated Plumbing. </em>We conclude, therefore, that the referee used proper reasoning and correctly based the modification of Sailman’s benefits on the Ametek position.</p>
