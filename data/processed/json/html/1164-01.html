Mr. Buchanan defaulted on his obligations under the mortgage by ceasing to make the monthly payments that came due on or after April 1, 2004. Appellee GMAC Mortgage Corporation (GMAC) initiated a mortgage foreclosure action on October 18, 2004. A default judgment of foreclosure was entered against Mr. Buchanan on December 22, 2004.</p>

Trial Court Opinion, 12/27/06, at 2. <em>See </em>Sheriff Service Process Receipt and Affidavit of Return, 2/27/06 (documenting personal service on February 27, 2006). Thus, Mr. Buchanan was placed on notice of the pending sale more than two months before the scheduled date. On Friday, April 28, 2006, one business day before the sheriffs sale, Mr. Buchanan initiated another bankruptcy petition. This was the third bankruptcy petition filed within the immediately preceding twelve month period during which two previous such petitions were pending and dismissed. (As discussed below, under the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code applicable in this case, no automatic stay provision applied to this bankruptcy petition.) On April 28, 2006, an employee of Mr. Buchanan’s counsel sent a facsimile copy of the notice of bankruptcy filing to the York County Sheriff’s Office. She subsequently contacted the Sheriffs Office and allegedly was informed orally, by an unnamed person, over the telephone, that the subject property would be removed from sheriffs sale.</p>

Whether a telephone call was or was not made to the sheriffs office does not alter the fact that no stay in bankruptcy was in place on the date of the sheriffs sale. As noted above, Appellant has not cited to any statutory provision, case law, statewide rule or local rule that absolved him from the responsibility of verifying that his real property was removed from the sheriffs sale list.
