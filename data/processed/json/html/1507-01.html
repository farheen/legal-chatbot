(2d) 842</a>.</p>
    <p id="b831-3" data-blocks='[["BL_831.4",831,[53,448,1313,245]]]'>We, therefore, agree with the Commissioner that appellant in the instant case, by <em>reason of </em>the <em>use </em>shown of “ Arch Preserver ” and without reference to whether “ Arch Preserver ” is or is not descriptive as nsed, has the right to oppose the registration sought, notwithstanding its disclaimer in the certificate of October 24, 1916.</p>
    <p id="b831-4" data-blocks='[["BL_831.5",831,[54,701,1314,144]]]'>The question then is, whether there is such a resemblance between “Arch Preserver” and “Foot Preserver” as that confusion would likely result from their application to boots and shoes.</p>
    <p id="b831-5" data-blocks='[["BL_831.6",831,[54,853,1315,285]]]'>We are not in agreement with the appellant’s contention that the dominant feature of the mark used by it is the disclaimed word “ Preserver,” or that the mark should be construed largely by that commonly used English word. The issue must be treated by considering the words “ Arch ” and “ Foot,” taken in connection with “ Preserver.”</p>
    <p id="b831-6" data-blocks='[["BL_831.7",831,[53,1156,1316,446]]]'>When applied to footwear we can not escape'the conviction that confusion would likely result. “ Arch ” when so applied carries with it a direct suggestion relating to a portion of the human foot. Foot is a term which embraces the arch. It is possible that there are terms relating to other parts of the foot which might not be confusing with “ Arch,” but if the positions of the respective parties hereto were reversed, and one were seeking to register “ Arch Preserver ” over the opposition of a prior user of “ Foot Preserver,” we apprehend the registration would be denied upon the issue of confusion.</p>
    <p id="b831-7" data-blocks='[["BL_831.8",831,[53,1609,1323,497]]]'>The evidence introduced by appellant in the effort to show actual confusion is not strongly impressive. In a proceeding in equity involving an issue of unfair competition <em>inter partes, </em>probably most of it, as presented, would be held inadmissible. Generally speaking, we think the usual rules relating to admissibility of evidence should be applied in these statutory proceedings. Where proofs are attempted they should be made with regard to these rules. But a definite ruling here upon the testimony objected to, at the time of its taking, by counsel for appellee, is not necessary — indeed not proper— since there is no specific assignment of error upon that feature.</p>
    <p id="b831-8" data-blocks='[["BL_831.9",831,[54,2113,1320,295]]]'>There is some evidence indicating actual confusion on the part of a newspaper in the preparation and issuance of advertising matter, when, intending to advertise “ Foot Preserver ” shoes, it caused the advertisement to be inserted for “Arch Preserver ” shoes, and then, in subsequently attempting to correct the error, made the advertisement read simply “ Preserver ” shoes.</p>
    <p id="b832-3" data-blocks='[["BL_832.3",832,[266,244,1316,136]]]'>
      <a id="p1514" href="#p1514" data-label="1514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1514</a>Independent of the testimony, however, we have the words themselves before us- to be considered in the light of the statute and of numerous decisions of this and other courts.</p>
    <p id="b832-4" data-blocks='[["BL_832.4",832,[265,395,1317,92]]]'>The first paragraph of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Registration Act reads, in part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b832-5" data-blocks='[["BL_832.5",832,[263,512,1319,111]]]'>That ho' mark by which the goods of the owners of the mark may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration as a trade-mark on account of the nature of such mark.</blockquote>
    <p id="b832-6" data-blocks='[["BL_832.6",832,[261,651,1322,346]]]'>It is required, therefore, that a mark to be registerable shall have the quality of distinguishing the goods upon which it is applied by its owner from other goods of the same class. Obviously, “ Foot Preserver,” on account of its resemblance to “Arch Preserver,” will not serve-to distinguish the goods labeled “Foot Preserver” from those labeled “Arch Preserver,” and is not, therefore, a mark, registration of which is proper under the statute.</p>
    <p id="b832-7" data-blocks='[["BL_832.7",832,[263,1003,1318,144]]]'>We think the registration sought must be denied upon the ground of likelihood of confusion. This being our view, it is not necessary to discuss the question of discriptiveness.</p>
    <p id="b832-8" data-blocks='[["BL_832.8",832,[265,1154,1315,91]]]'>For the reasons stated, the decision of the commissioner is <em>reversed </em>and the registration denied.</p>
    <p id="b832-9" data-blocks='[["BL_832.9",832,[263,1253,1316,93]]]'>The costs incident to records furnished in response to <em>praecipe </em>of appellee are adjudged against appellee.</p>
