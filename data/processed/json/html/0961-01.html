Following a stipulated juvenile bench trial, appellant J.M. was found guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it, in violation of D.C.Code § 33-541(a) (1988). On appeal, he contends that the trial judge committed reversible error when he denied J.M.’s pretrial motion to suppress 110 grams (roughly a quarter of a pound) of crack cocaine. The contraband was strapped to J.M.’s body and recovered by police when they boarded the bus on which J.M. was riding at the Washington, D.C. Greyhound-Trailways bus terminal at 2:30 a.m. on October 31, 1989 to interview and conduct “consent” searches of passengers in order to determine if any of them were carrying illegal drugs. A police detective eventually reached J.M., and, after interrogating him and searching his luggage, patted him down and found the cocaine.</p>

We reach this conclusion primarily because J.M. was only fourteen years of age at the time of the encounter, because he was not advised of his right to withhold his consent, and because the surrounding circumstances as described by the police detective who testified for the District (including the cramped space on the bus, the pressures incident to the presence of numerous other passengers, and the occurrence of the encounter at 2:30 a.m.) were such that J.M.’s choice was not free in the practical context of its exercise.

The dispute between the parties relates primarily to the legal consequences of uncontested facts.</p>
    <p id="b1029-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1029.10",1029,[1021,960,750,759]]]'>Detective Zattau testified that in the early morning hours of October 31, 1989, he and a team of officers from his unit were at the Greyhound-Trailways bus station in Washington, D.C. Their assignment was to interrogate passengers arriving in or passing through Washington, D.C. from New York City and presumably to search them if there was cause or if police secured their consent. At about 2:30 a.m., a bus arrived from New York en route to various points to the south, one of which was Wilmington, North Carolina. After the driver announced a ten-minute rest stop, Zattau and two other officers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> who were all dressed in civilian clothes, boarded the bus.</p>
    <p id="b1029-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1029.11",1029,[1021,1750,750,462]]]'>Detective Zattau took control of the intercom without first asking the bus driver for authority to do so.

After questioning several passengers, Detective Zattau approached J.M., who was occupying a window seat approximately three quarters of the way to the rear. Zattau inquired where J.M. had <a id="p964" href="#p964" data-label="964" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*964</a>boarded the bus and where he was going, and requested to see J.M.’s ticket. J.M. responded to these questions and showed the detective his ticket, which reflected a trip from New York to Wilmington. Zat-tau then asked J.M. whether he was carrying drugs or weapons; J.M. replied that he was not. The detective asked if he could search J.M.’s bag; J.M. agreed, but the search revealed nothing.</p>
    <p id="b1030-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1030.4",1030,[217,744,752,858]]]'>J.M. undoubtedly hoped, and may well have believed, that his ordeal was now over and that he would escape the encounter without the police discovering the contraband which was concealed on his person, but it was not to be. Detective Zattau testified that he next asked J.M. if he could pat him down. J.M. denied that Zattau ever made such a request, but testified that he raised his arms in response to Zattau’s request that he do so. The detective felt a large, hard lump next to J.M.’s rib cage, lifted J.M.’s shirt, and discovered a clear plastic bag containing 110 grams of a rock substance which subsequently proved, upon chemical analysis, to be crack cocaine. J.M. was arrested, and the cocaine never reached Wilmington.</p>

He indicated that if any of them had done so, this would have attracted his attention, and he would have attempted to investigate further. He stated that if J.M. had refused to answer any questions, he might have asked him the reason for his refusal, for he had been instructed that there was nothing wrong in asking why. He acknowledged that passengers had no way of knowing what would occur if they refused to permit a search, and that he made no attempt to enlighten them on the subject. On redirect examination, Detective Zattau stated that on past occasions, when a passenger had refused his request to search a bag, this had been the end of the interview.</p>
    <p id="b1030-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1030.13",1030,[1018,345,750,1165]]]'>J.M. testified that he was fourteen years old at the time of the incident and that he had recently begun the ninth grade. No evidence was adduced that he had ever had any prior encounter with the law. J.M. stated, not surprisingly, that he became afraid when the officers boarded the bus. He felt that he could not leave the vehicle because any attempt to depart would have attracted attention to him. He stated that the passageway in the middle of the bus was very narrow, and that one of the officers was standing between J.M.’s location and the only available exit. J.M. also testified that he was afraid that the police would become suspicious if he did not agree to allow the detective to search his bag. He insisted that he raised his hands to facilitate the patdown because he felt he had no choice, and because any non-cooperation on his part would have made the police even more suspicious of him. J.M. admitted that he had told the detective that he had no drugs on his person, and that this statement was not true.</p>
    <p id="b1030-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1030.14",1030,[1016,1538,748,655]]]'>J.M. acknowledged that the detective spoke to him in a polite and conversational tone of voice and did not abuse or threaten him. There was no overt intimidation, and J.M. did not claim that the detective ever drew his weapon. A fair summary of J.M.’s testimony is that he cooperated with Detective Zattau because he apprehended that if he did not do so, the police would have regarded him as someone who had something to hide, and that this would not have been to his advantage. This, indeed, was also the prosecutor’s theory, as his cross-examination of J.M. plainly revealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He stated that there was no indication that Detective Zat-tau had overborne J.M.’s will. The judge credited Detective Zattau’s testimony that he had requested and received J.M.’s permission before patting him down, and further found that the consent was voluntary. “Consistent with his desire to deflect suspicion from himself,” the judge reasoned,</p>

First, he claims that the police interrogation and activities prior to the frisk amounted to a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, in that under all of the circumstances a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave the bus or to decline to respond to police questions. Since the cocaine seized following the frisk was a fruit of what J.M. claims to have been an illegal seizure, he maintains that it ought to have been suppressed.</p>

In support of that contention, J.M. cites his youth, the failure of the police to advise him that he had the right to withhold consent, and what he contends was the intrinsically coercive situation created by the police’s initiation of the encounter in the cramped quarters of a bus in the middle of the night and in the presence of numerous passengers to whom any lack of cooperation on J.M.’s part would have been obvious and would have appeared suspicious as well.

An intention on the part of the police to use coercive tactics in response to a passenger’s exercise of his or her rights, even if uncommunicated to the passenger, is relevant to the state of mind of the officers, and puts everything they did into perspective. What a detective contemplates doing later can shed a good deal of light on how he probably proceeded earlier.</p>

But neither does <em>Schneckloth </em>(nor Bostick) in my view justify an appellate court’s segregating out factors such as age and non-advice of rights and holding, as a matter of law, that these will invalidate consent unless a specific countervailing factor — prior experience with the law or police — is also present.

Our Youth Rehabilitation Act, for example, generally renders eligible for “youth offender” treatment a person less than 22 years old, D.G.Code § 24-801(6) (1989). Also, to paraphrase the majority, it is apparent to any reader of the newspapers that some 14-year-olds are “more 14 than others.” In any case, no matter how closely the juvenile defendant approaches majority, the trial court henceforth will know that its assessment of two factors bearing on consent — the effect of youth and non-advice of rights — will be reviewed differently than all others by the appellate court, <em>i.e., </em>“primarily [as issues] of law,” <em>ante </em>at 975.

The majority finds it nearly impossible to accept that a boy of J.M.’s years could consent out of calculation, however ill-founded, rather than intimidation and ignorance of his rights. In part this may reflect a belief that no one, adult or child, carrying drugs on his person would freely consent to a pat-down.

It is not apparent, first, how these pressures would have been any different had J.M. been advised of his right to withhold consent. Moreover, underlying the majority’s description of the “adverse consequences” J.M. could anticipate from refusing to consent lies an apparent skepticism about the possibility of consent in these police-citizen encounters, involving adults <em>or </em>juveniles, that makes its adoption of special rules for juvenile consent inevitable, but correspondingly flawed. We are told, for example, that “most reasonable people would believe that the police have considerable power and that it is best not to defy or make enemies of officers,” <em>ante </em>at 975; and so it is doubtful that “any reasonable person could expect an act of defiance <em>\i.e., </em>a refusal to consent] to bring him no unfavorable consequences,” <em>id. </em>Translated into practice, of course, these assertions would cast grave doubt on the legitimacy of our decision in <em>Kelly v.
