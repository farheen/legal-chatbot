But the specification is that being a married man he committed said offense with one Angela Cato, a single woman, and so the jury found him guilty of adultery. This is the practice long established under the Code, and we believe the Gaming Act has received asimilar construction. The nature of the offense charged could not but be sufficiently understood by the jury, if the accusation be not in the very language of the Code. The other objection is that the indictment does not charge that the woman was a free white woman, or that she was a woman of color, free or slave, and the objection would seem to be well taken under the authority of the decision in 22 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>101. There the defendant was indicted for playing and betting at cards, and this Court held that it ought to show whether the person with whom the playing and betting were done was a white person or a negro. For it was insisted that that offense, like this, could be committed with a person of either color, and moreover, it is argued that the decision in 22 <em>Georgia Reports </em>overrules the case of <em>John, a slave, vs. The State, </em>16 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>200, wherein this Court held, that any one, whether bond or free, who is indicted <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>for homicide, is, in legal intendment,- indicted for killing a free white person, and if the killing is of a slave or free person of color or any one within the exceptional cases, the indictment should so charge it. The two cases referred to seem to contradict each other. We hold that the decision in 16 <em>Georgia </em>was right in principle, and that the decision in 22 <em>Georgia </em>to this extent — the objection in the latter was not good by way of demurrer to the indictment. If the indictment is general, not alleging whether the person with or against whom the offense is committed is white or colored, and the evidence shows it is the latter under such a general indictment, the testimony would be demurrable and the prosecution must fail. The objection, therefore, in the case in 22 <em>Georgia </em>was premature and ought not to have-been sustained at the time it was made. In the case at bar, the indictment was good and supported by the proof. There was, therefore, no ground for the motion in arrest of judgment.</p>
