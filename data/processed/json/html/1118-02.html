A preliminary hearing was held before District Justice Frank C. Wise on December 4,1991, and appellant was held for court. On May 11, 1992, appellant filed the omnibus pretrial motion which contained a request for a bill of particulars, a request for discovery, a motion to suppress and two motions to dismiss. On May 13th, the omnibus motion was granted by the trial court.</p>

On May 26, 1992, the trial court scheduled the hearing for June 19, 1992, which was subsequently continued until September 16, 1992. At this hearing, the trial court reinstated the two counts, as the totality of the evidence submitted at the preliminary hearing was sufficient to find a prima facie case. The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the reconsideration as it set the hearing within thirty (30) days of the <a id="p1120" href="#p1120" data-label="1120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1120</a>Order.

Appellant argues the Order dismissing the two counts was a final Order and, therefore, had to be appealed by the Commonwealth to this Court or modified by the trial court within the 30-day period outlined by 42 Pa.

Generally, a final Order is one which ends the litigation or disposes of the entire case. <em>Patton v. Hanover Ins.

According to the Commonwealth, on May 11, 1992, they did receive a request for a bill of particulars. But, according to them motion to reconsider which was filed immediately after receiving the court Order, they never had the opportunity to respond to appellant’s averments. A final Order cannot be granted when one party has not received notice of the proceeding. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure do not allow for such a motion as part of an omnibus pretrial motion. Pa.R.Crim.P. 306. A motion to dismiss, pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 315, is limited to averring that an information has not been filed within a reasonable time or that' an indictment has not been found against a defendant within a reasonable time. Rule 315(a). Neither of these grounds are relevant here. Pursuant to Rule 306, an omnibus pretrial motion may contain a motion to quash an indictment or information when it is alleged that the indictment or information is defective, but it cannot be a means of testing the adequacy or competency of the Commonwealth’s evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.
