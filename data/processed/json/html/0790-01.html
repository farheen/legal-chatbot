When Irma Colon answered the door, she found Appellant dressed in a Philadelphia Gas Works uniform and representing that he was there to check the gas meter. After being let into the house, Appellant took hold of Irma Colon’s neck and demanded that she give him the key to admit an accomplice into the house. Appellant and his accomplice proceeded to the bedroom in which Mr. Ortiz, Carmen Colon and their son were sleeping. He threatened to kill Irma Colon unless Ortiz let him into the bedroom. Appellant then demanded money, jewelry, and drugs. Appellant forced Ortiz and Irma Colon to the floor, threatening to kill them if he did not find what he was seeking. The accomplice proceeded to ransack the house. Appellant beat Irma Colon in the head with his gun until she lost consciousness. Carmen Colon watched as Appellant and his accomplice beat Ortiz and bound his hands and feet. Her eyes were closed when she heard a gunshot. When she opened them, she saw Ortiz laying on the floor with a gunshot wound to the head.</p>

At the penalty phase, the jury found three aggravating circumstances: the murder occurred in the perpetration of a felony (burglary); defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another; and defendant had a significant history of violent crime felony convictions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), (7), (9). The jury found two mitigating circumstances: defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime; and the defendant’s circumstances fit within the catch-all mitigating circumstance. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), (8). As the mitigating circumstances were out weighed by the aggravating circumstances, the jury sentenced Appellant to death for the murder of Jose Ortiz.

In Pennsylvania, we begin with the presumption that counsel is effective. <em>Commonwealth v.

In order to overcome this presumption, an appellant must establish three elements: (1) the underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for his action; and (3) the petitioner was prejudiced by the ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975-76 (1987). In determining whether counsel’s actions were reasonable, we do not question whether there were other more logical courses of action which counsel could have pursued: rather, we must examine whether counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis. <em>Rollins, </em><a href="/a2d/738/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="738 A.2d 435" data-case-ids="11564986,838563" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0435-01,/pa/558/0532-01">738 A.2d at 441</a>.

Further, we have held that “[i]f it is clear that Appellant has not demonstrated that counsel’s act or omission adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings, the claim may be dismissed on that basis alone and the court need not first determine whether the first and second prongs have been met.” <em>Commonwealth v.

First, although we have historically considered the language contained in these standard instructions to be an aid in our review, we have not placed our imprimatur upon them. See generally, <em>Commonwealth v.

Second, even if we had adopted this specific instruction, it is an unquestionable maxim of law in this Commonwealth that a trial court has broad discretion in phrasing its instruction, and may choose its own wording so long as the law is clearly, adequately, and accurately presented to the jury for its consideration. <em>Commonwealth v. Ohle, </em><a href="/pa/503/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="503 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1785935" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0566-01">503 Pa. 566</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="503 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1785935" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0566-01">470 A.2d 61</a>, 70 (1983). In this matter the distinction between “hesitate” and “restrain before acting” is <em>de minimis </em>and clearly such a subtle variation in phrasing would not be an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. Finally, this court has actually approved of a reasonable doubt instruction which tells the jury that it is “the kind of doubt that would restrain a reasonable man (or woman) from acting....” <em>Commonwealth v.

The fact that Ms. Colon was romantically involved with the decedent establishes a reason for her presence in the room at the time of the incident. Her son’s age is relevant to explain his lack of participation as a witness. Her pregnancy shows a reason for remaining on the bed rather than actively resisting. That she was merely wearing a bra and panties explain why she requested time to put on clothes before admitting Appellant into the bedroom. While the jury could potentially piece these facts together to find some sympathy for Carmen Colon and her son due to victim’s death, this was not the purpose of their admission.

Appellant’s claim for ineffectiveness cannot succeed here as he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s argument. The few sentences urging the jury to infer a well-planned and executed crime from the absence of a shell casing were but a minor addition to the closing argument. This case focused primarily on identification, the well-hatched plan was not a significant part of the prosecution’s theory. It was supported, however, by other evidence, such as the fact that Appellant and his accomplice procured Philadelphia Gas Works uniforms and gained entry into the house by claiming that they needed to check the gas meter.

While he was also being prosecuted for a drug related offense at the time of his testimony he was not yet convicted. In his closing argument, the prosecutor did not argue that Jacinto Rios had never been in trouble, rather, he argued that Jacinto had never killed anyone. As such, taken in context, Jacinto Rios’ testimony as to his criminal record was not misleading. In addition, Appellant has set forth nothing to prove that, even if these comments were improper, they caused him prejudice. A bald assertion of improper questions in the course of cross examination is insufficient, absent a showing of prejudice, to support a claim for ineffectiveness. <em>See Albrecht, </em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">720 A.2d at 701</a>.</p>

On the life-history aspect, the majority indicates that Appellant specifically instructed trial counsel not to present additional family witnesses and threatened counsel. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>slip op. </em>at 24. The PCRA court, however, did not rest its decision on this evidence or make a credibility assessment in this regard. Moreover, there was evidence of additional discussions with Appellant, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., April 4, 2000, at 67-68; trial counsel further testified at the post-conviction hearing that he did not believe that he was impeded from presenting all of the mitigating evidence that he had available to him, <em>see </em>N.T., April 4, 2000, at 141-42; and counsel did secure family witness testimony. In these circumstances, I have difficulty with the application of <em>Commonwealth v.

Rather, in such situations, I believe that a factfinder should examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether and to what degree a capital defendant has forbidden the presentation of mitigating evidence. Particularly given the dynamic character of death-penalty litigation, when combined with the substantial pressures associated with a capital trial, I do not support reliance by an appellate court upon isolated remarks taken out of their full context, especially in the absence of relevant factual findings. Indeed, given the consequences of this sort of decision, where a defendant chooses to waive mitigation, this Court has indicated that the trial court should be involved and colloquy the defendant to confirm a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of mitigation. <em>See Crawley, </em><a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="228" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">514 Pa. at </a>550-51 n. 1, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="229" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">526 A.2d at </a>340 n.

In terms of life history, the jurors heard only that Appellant was born in Puerto Rico, that he was ten years old when he came to the United States, and that his mother committed suicide by setting herself on fire. <em>See <a href="/pa/535/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="262" data-cite="635 A.2d 603" data-case-ids="1841565,7368570" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0350-01,/a2d/635/0603-01">id.</a> </em>By comparison, the post-conviction <a id="p825" href="#p825" data-label="825" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*825</a>case included, <em>inter alia, </em>evidence that Appellant was abandoned at an early age by his father; witnessed several suicide attempts by his mother prior to her eventual self-immolation; was disfavored and abused by relatives when he came to the United States; was ultimately barred from his father’s household around the age of twelve or thirteen; became addicted to heroin during this time period; and engaged in bizarre behaviors and suffered from delusions from an early age. A fair amount of this information was contained in pre-sentence reports available to counsel. <em>See </em>1984 Pre-Sentence Investigation Report ("After his mother’s departure, the family structure dissolved" and Appellant was a "product of a broken home and subsequent [to the] reported suicide of his mother, he appeared to have been reared without the benefit of adequate discipline, guidance, love and supervision.”). The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the potential value of this sort of evidence in terms of mitigation in a capital case. <em>See, e.g., Wiggins, </em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="263" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">539 U.S. at 535</a>, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="264" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">123 S.Ct. at </a>2542 (citing cases).</p>

Dr. O'Brien did, however, render a mental-health diagnosis of alcohol and mixed substance abuse by history, which is recognized under the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (“DSM-IV”). <em>See </em>N.T., July 25, 2000, at 92. Further, he indicated that he did not have enough information concerning whether Appellant suffered from any condition under the DSM's Axis II categorization. <em>See </em>N.T., July 25, 2000, at 90 ("I think that he has a variety of problems, but that does not render an Axis II, because I don’t feel I have enough information.”); <em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="265" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">id.</a> </em>("I'm not concluding he doesn’t suffer from other problems....”). Various aspects of Dr. O’Brien's testimony also highlighted the potential value of mental-health evidence in terms of providing context. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 103 (reflecting Dr. O’Brien’s explanation that neglect and abandonment is "[o]ftentimes connected with development of his behavior and problems with the law”).</p>

I find the majority’s decision particularly troubling to the extent that it can be read as suggesting that a finding of any catch-all mitigating circumstance by at least one juror will foreclose a challenge based upon a capital attorney’s failure to investigate and present other reasonably available catch-all-type evidence of a different character.
