    <p id="b1406-26" data-blocks='[["BL_1406.23",1406,[994,989,750,517]]]'>This matter came before the Supreme Court on January 25, 1994, pursuant to an order directing the plaintiff, Darlene E. Cobb, to show cause why her appeal of a Family Court order should not be summarily decided. That order directed the defendant, Bruce Cobb, to pay the amount of $5,000 over a twelve-month period to counsel who represented the plaintiff in her motion that sought sole custody of the parties’ two minor children, child support and counsel fees.</p>
    <p id="b1406-27" data-blocks='[["BL_1406.24",1406,[993,1531,748,133]]]'>After hearing the arguments of counsel and after reviewing their memoranda, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown.</p>
    <p id="b1406-28" data-blocks='[["BL_1406.25",1406,[990,1689,753,180]]]'>In the instant appeal on the sole issue of attorney fees, plaintiff argued that the award was insufficient, based on evidence that supported an award of $9,156 in fees.</p>

The parties do not disagree that plaintiffs attorney was entitled to his fee of $9,156. However, before an award is warranted, there must be a finding that “the husband has sufficient ability to pay such fees and that the wife has insufficient assets available for that purpose.” <em>Tarro v. Tarro, </em><a href="/a2d/485/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="485 A.2d 558" data-case-ids="7911555" data-case-paths="/a2d/485/0558-01">485 A.2d 558</a>, 564 (R.I.1984). Although the Master did not specifically incorporate the elements enumerated in G.L.1956 (1988 Reenactment) § 15-5-16 in determining the amount of counsel fees, we are of the opinion that evidence sufficient to support the ruling was <a id="p1333" href="#p1333" data-label="1333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1333</a>presented. Consequently, we deny and dismiss the appeal and affirm the order of the Family Court.</p>
