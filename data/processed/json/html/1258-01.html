The County demanded the return of those unclaimed funds pursuant to the Debt Act.

They also argue that the money the County seeks is not public monies, but money that belongs solely to bondholders who have not yet come forward. Additionally, although the Banks admit that the purpose of issuing bonds is ordinarily to raise revenue for a municipality, they argue that such an action is entirely a matter of discretion left up to the municipality.

Even if the money belongs to bondholders, when the funds are unclaimed, the Unclaimed Property Act then takes over to ensure the safety of those funds. Specifically, because the County is seeking damages based on the Banks’ failure to comply with the Debt Act, that is even more of a reason to prove that the County was involved with a strictly public right rather than a private right. Consequently, the doctrine does not bar the County’s claim.</p>

Excess of revenues over expenses for a transaction; sometimes used synonymously with net income for the period. Gain realized from business or investment over and above expenditures. Profit means accession of good, valuable results, useful consequences, avail, gain, as in office of profit, excess of returns over expenditures, or excess of income over expenditure.”</p>

      <a id="p1265" href="#p1265" data-label="1265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1265</a>I would conclude that, based upon the language of the Act, once the duty to escheat arose, the Banks had the duty to include in that escheatment not only the amount owed to the original bondholders’ under the terms of the bond, but also the interest that has accrued. This result comports not only with the straightforward language of the statute, but also with the long-standing principle the majority rejects — that interest follows principal.

Our Supreme Court has confirmed the application of the principle in considering a claim by a decedent’s sister that the decedent intended to make a gift, rather than a loan, to his sister of a certificate of deposit. The Court, noting that the decedent had taken sole possession of the interest that had accrued on the certificate, concluded that the claimant had failed to present evidence of the decedent’s donative intent, because “[i]t is fundamental that the interest follows the principal in ownership.” <em>Lessner v.

In the case of these missing bondholders, whose unclaimed property is the source of the interest or accretion, they (or their heirs) have lost the potential use of their money, albeit for reasons for which they are responsible. Had they (or their heirs) claimed their property at an earlier time, they, rather than the County, could have reaped the reward of additional income from reinvestment. I read no convincing reason why, under the present circumstances and the operation of the Unclaimed Property Act, the County should be in a better position than the bondholders to glean a benefit from another’s use of their unclaimed property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

I also question whether the County has the right to pursue this action under the Debt Act.
