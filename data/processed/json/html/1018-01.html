Respondent also argues that he was protected by the Fifth Amendment in his refusal to respond to Bar Counsel’s initial inquiry. In our view, respondent’s reliance upon the Fifth Amendment is misplaced. The Board correctly concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination may properly be invoked only under circumstances involving allegations of criminal misconduct. <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em><a href="/us/414/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="414 U.S. 70" data-case-ids="11715156" data-case-paths="/us/414/0070-01">414 U.S. 70</a>, <a href="/us/414/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="414 U.S. 70" data-case-ids="11715156" data-case-paths="/us/414/0070-01">94 S.Ct. 316</a>, <a href="/us/414/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="414 U.S. 70" data-case-ids="11715156" data-case-paths="/us/414/0070-01">38 L.Ed.2d 274</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b1049-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1049.10",1049,[938,674,749,792]]]'>Respondent contends that the failure to respond to a client’s phone calls does not constitute neglect under DR 6— 101(A)(3), when other steps are being taken on the client’s behalf. We disagree. Respondent’s willful failure to communicate with a client, James P. Jones, particularly after being requested to do so by the trial court, resulted in neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him. Moreover, respondent conceded on the record that this controversy might have been avoided had he taken the time to speak with Jones and other members of his family who called on his behalf.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, the record substantially supports the Board’s finding that respondent violated DR 6-101(A)(3).</p>

D.C.App.R. XI, Section 7(3) provides in pertinent part that the court “shall adopt the recommended disposition of the Board unless to do so would foster a tendency toward inconsistent dispositions for comparable conduct or otherwise would be unwarranted.” As we noted in <em>In re Smith, </em><a href="/a2d/403/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="403 A.2d 296" data-case-ids="8040031" data-case-paths="/a2d/403/0296-01">403 A.2d 296</a>, 303 (D.C.1979), the Board has broad discretion in handing out discipline subject only to this court’s general review for abuse. “The rule requires that we should respect the Board’s sense of <a id="p1020" href="#p1020" data-label="1020" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1020</a>equity in these matters unless that exercise of judgment proves to be unreasonable.” <em>In re Haupt, </em><a href="/a2d/422/0768-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="422 A.2d 768" data-case-ids="7947269" data-case-paths="/a2d/422/0768-01">422 A.2d 768</a>, 771 (D.C.1980). While we strive to observe the rule’s mandate to achieve consistency in the disposition of disciplinary cases, each case must necessarily be decided on its own particular facts. <em>In re Russell, </em><a href="/a2d/424/1087-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="424 A.2d 1087" data-case-ids="7965750" data-case-paths="/a2d/424/1087-01">424 A.2d 1087</a>, 1088 (D.C.1980). In general, when we have approved suspensions of an attorney found to have neglected a client’s legal matters the conduct complained of has been particularly aggravated or has been compounded by other violations. <em>See In re Haupt, <a href="/a2d/422/0768-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="422 A.2d 768" data-case-ids="7947269" data-case-paths="/a2d/422/0768-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/422/0768-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="422 A.2d 768" data-case-ids="7947269" data-case-paths="/a2d/422/0768-01">422 A.2d at 768</a>; <em>In re Fogel, </em><a href="/citations/?q=422%20A.2d%20966" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="422 A.2d 966">422 A.2d 966</a> (D.C.1980); <em>In re Smith, <a href="/a2d/403/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="403 A.2d 296" data-case-ids="8040031" data-case-paths="/a2d/403/0296-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/403/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="403 A.2d 296" data-case-ids="8040031" data-case-paths="/a2d/403/0296-01">403 A.2d at 296</a>.</p>
    <p id="b1050-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1050.4",1050,[209,1123,748,1151]]]'>Here, respondent was found to have neglected legal matters on behalf of a client in two separate cases involving separate clients. With regard to one of these clients, respondent failed to seek his lawful objectives.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In a third case, respondent did not adequately respond to the inquiries of Bar Counsel concerning the complaint made by the client. Clearly, therefore, the conduct of respondent complained of was compounded by other violations. This case is therefore distinguishable from <em>In re Lieber, <a href="/a2d/442/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="442 A.2d 153" data-case-ids="7944708" data-case-paths="/a2d/442/0153-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/442/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="442 A.2d 153" data-case-ids="7944708" data-case-paths="/a2d/442/0153-01">442 A.2d at 153</a>, where we held that a six month suspension of an attorney for conduct amounting to neglect was appropriate. But in <em>Lieber, </em>the attorney was guilty of neglect against only one client and not two as is the case at bar. Consequently, a suspension greater than six months is not unreasonable. Because in our view the neglect evidenced by respondent in this case was so pronounced as to warrant a two year suspension, the Report and Recommendation of the Board must be approved.</p>
