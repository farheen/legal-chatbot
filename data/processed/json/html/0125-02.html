    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[149,335,755,1515]]]'>On October 21, 1991, plaintiff was an employee of Temp Pro Resources (Temp Pro), an employment agency. He was assigned by Temp Pro to work for defendant, Colibrí Corporation (Colibrí). Colibrí (1) exercised all supervision and control over plaintiff while he worked at the company, (2) was solely responsible for instructing plaintiff regarding how and where work was to be performed, (3) supplied any necessary tools and equipment, (4) determined the length of time that plaintiff would be required to work, and (5) had the right to refuse to accept plaintiff as an employee and to discharge him if his work was unsatisfactory. It is conceded by the parties that plaintiff was paid by Temp Pro. It is implicitly conceded that Temp Pro paid for workers’ compensation insurance covering plaintiff. It is also undisputed that Colibrí paid Temp Pro for plaintiffs services. This series of assertions leads ineluctably to the inference that said amount was sufficient to cover all Temp Pro’s expenses incident to plaintiffs employment, including the cost of workers’ compensation insurance. Although the record does not specifically set forth these amounts, the motion justice could take judicial notice that Temp Pro is not an eleemosynary corporation and would therefore include in its charge all necessary expenses together with an amount for profit.</p>

Santiago, who was operating a fork-lift machine, had occasion to stop the fork lift and step out of the machine.

The plaintiff suffered physical injuries and incurred hospital and medical expenses as a result of this accident.</p>

The plaintiff subsequently initiated an action against Colibrí and Santiago, alleging that their negligence proximately caused his injuries. Colibrí moved for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by § 28-29-20, which provides that workers’ compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy against an employer. The plaintiff opposed the motion for summary judgment, claiming that when there is both a general employer and a special employer, pursuant to § 28-29-2(3)(C), as amended by P.L.1991, ch. 206, § 1, the general employer is deemed the employer, and therefore, the special employer is not an employer as contemplated by the act. Because the special employer is not an employer, plaintiff argued, it is not protected by the immunity granted an “employer” by § 28-29-20 and is thus amenable to suit.</p>

Part of that $0.66 per hour will pay someone’s premium, and in the eyes of the law it must be deemed to have paid the premium for this plaintiff. In other words, <em>the plaintiff is suing in tort the man who paid for his Workman’s Compensation. </em>The defendant paid part of this extra $0.66 per hour for the sole and express purpose of assuring that employees which Manpower sent over for temporary employment would be covered by Workman’s Compensation. The defendant paid part of this extra $0.66 per hour for the sole and express purpose of not having to defend actions such as the one which has been 'brought here. This case strikes at the heart of the Workman’s Compensation law; this case is in unequivocal opposition to the well-known principles on which Workman’s Compensation is founded.” <em>St. Claire, </em><a href="/f-supp/211/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="211 F.

Although the record does not set forth the specific amounts, it must be presumed that Colibrí paid Temp Pro a higher rate for Sorenson’s services than Temp Pro, in turn, paid to Sorenson. Temp Pro procured workers’ compensation insurance to cover Sorenson, and it must be presumed that part of the differential in rate paid by Colibrí to Temp Pro was to cover Temp Pro’s cost of procuring this insurance. Thus, although Temp Pro purchased this insurance, the cost of the premium was paid by Colibrí as part of the total fee it paid to Temp Pro. When one views the situation, it would seem that Soren-son is suing the party that paid for his workers’ compensation benefits. Such a result, as expressed in <em>St. Claire, </em>completely defeats the purpose of the workers’ compensation statute.</p>

It involved a plaintiff employed by Manpower, an employment agency, who was injured while on assignment at the plant of the defendant. As is customary practice, the client company (the defendant) paid Manpower a fee for the plaintiffs services, and Manpower in turn paid the plaintiff and purchased workers’ compensation insurance. The sole issue was whether the defendant was immune to the plaintiffs tort suit pursuant to the immunity granted an employer under the Alabama Workmen’s Compensation Act.

We do not believe that the Legislature had any intention of eliminating a special employer’s status as an employer.

Such a provision, however, would probably make the use of such labor brokers economically unfeasible.

The defendants also requested entry of judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting there was no just reason for delaying entry of judgment. The record contains no evidence of the entry of a Rule 54(b) judgment.

Since both defendants' motions for summary judgment were granted, Colibri's lack of a Rule 54(b) judgment is not fatal to its appeal.
