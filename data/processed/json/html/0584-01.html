The Commonwealth complains about the sentencing court’s failure to impose a mandatory minimum sentence that it contends is applicable herein. Gutierrez, who we will refer to as Appellant, assails the adequacy of the warrant utilized to search his residence and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for possession of a prohibited offensive weapon. We reject the allegations of error raised by Appellant, but conclude that the Commonwealth’s position is meritorious. We vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing.</p>
    <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.7",614,[189,1403,752,1021]]]'>¶ 2 The record establishes the following. On January 2, 2007, police secured a warrant to search 657 Clinton Street, Reading, and Appellant’s person for drugs, proof of residency at that location, and other evidence of drug-related activities. The affi-ant was Reading Police Officer Jose A. Colon, who had been assigned to the Vice and Narcotics Section of the Reading Police Department for approximately twelve years. Officer Colon’s affidavit of probable cause indicated that he had conducted an investigation of drug-related activities at 657 Clinton Street with the assistance of a confidential source who had been given the designation of Confidential Source Number 818 (“CS”) by the Reading Police Department. Officer Colon further attested that CS was then providing information to that department, and</p>

The information provided has included the names and addresses of area drug dealers, the types of drugs [they are] dealing, manner in which [they are] packaged and a considerable amount of intelligence information. All of the information has been independently verified through the use of various investigative techniques. The CS information has led to several Federal indictments, State and Federal search warrants and to the arrest and conviction of well over 25 persons for the distribution of mostly crack cocaine. One of the more recent was based on information supplied by the CS which led to a search warrant, arrest and conviction of Shelly Smith-Greene for Poss/ PWI cocaine of more th[a]n one ounce of crack cocaine.</blockquote>

The CS has become familiar with those persons and their operations. The CS has been exposed to the sight of numerous controlled substances, including cocaine and has become knowledgeable of what these substances look like, how they are packaged for street sales, average street prices and other details involved in the illegal sales of controlled substances.</blockquote>

Within the forty-eight-hour period preceding January 2, 2007, the CS purchased crack cocaine pursuant to a controlled buy at 657 Clinton Street. After the purchase, the CS informed Officer Colon that he had purchased the drugs from Appellant. The CS gave Officer Colon the drugs, and Officer Colon field tested them. They tested positively as cocaine. Officer Colon also searched the files of the Reading Police Department and “located suspect Antonio Gutierrez, [J]r., listed address as 657 Clinton St., Reading[.]” <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>

Police knocked and announced their presence and purpose, and Appellant answered the door and allowed them to enter the residence. Police discovered a plastic sandwich bag containing eighteen smaller plastic packets of cocaine and two other plastic sandwich bags containing bulk cocaine hidden in Appellant’s buttocks. In Appellant’s pants pockets, there were keys to the house and approximately $200 in cash.</p>
    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[120,988,751,768]]]'>¶ 4 On top of the refrigerator in the kitchen, police found a plate with cocaine, materials associated with cocaine distribution, and a Talon .380 caliber handgun with a magazine containing eight rounds of ammunition. A box of twelve gauge shotgun shells also was located in the kitchen. In the living room, there was a bag of cocaine, two bags of marijuana, and a Winchester twelve gauge shotgun, which had been sawed off and hidden behind the stereo system. Police also found various letters, bills and other documents addressed to Appellant at 657 Clinton Street, Reading.</p>

The jury returned a guilty verdict on the three charges before it. Since this case pertained to controlled substances, the issue of the amount of drugs possessed by Appellant became pertinent to certain mandatory minimum sentences applicable under The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. Upon questioning, the jury informed the court that its verdict had been unanimous only with respect to Appellant’s possession of the drugs found on his person and that it had not unanimously concluded that Appellant possessed the cocaine found in the kitchen or the cocaine and marijuana located in the living room.</p>

Having previously supplied Appellant with notice of its intent to do so, the Commonwealth invoked the mandatory minimum sentencing provision enacted at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1, which provides for a five-year minimum sentence relating to a defendant’s conviction of drug charges and the possession of firearms. The sentencing court decided that the Commonwealth had not produced sufficient evidence to support application of the mandatory minimum sentence. It did impose a mandatory minimum sentence relating to the weight of the seized drugs.</p>
    <p id="b615-9" data-blocks='[["BL_615.8",615,[919,1391,751,767]]]'>¶ 7 Appellant subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court should not have included the weight of the cocaine found on the refrigerator and in the living room for sentencing purposes. Appellant’s sentence was vacated, and on April 2, 2008, a new sentencing hearing was conducted. The court accepted Appellant’s position regarding the weight of drugs that he possessed, again refused to apply the mandatory minimum sentencing provision set forth at section 9712.1, and imposed an aggregate sentence of fourteen months to sixty months imprisonment followed by five years probation.</p>

These two events are part of the established sequence associated with a controlled buy and the reasonable inference created is that a controlled buy was conducted. Pursuant to standard operating procedure during a controlled buy, Officer Colon would have observed the CS enter 657 Clinton Street with marked currency and return with drugs and without the currency.

    <p id="b621-8" data-blocks='[["BL_621.7",621,[915,975,750,557]]]'>¶ 28 In response, the Commonwealth claimed that the handgun was relevant because it was found “sitting right next to a plate of bulk cocaine with razor blades.” <em>Id. </em>at 9. The trial court ruled that the photograph of the handgun sitting next to the cocaine found in the kitchen would be admitted at trial. Thus, that photograph established that cocaine was found next to a handgun on top of the refrigerator in Appellant’s kitchen.</p>
    <p id="b621-9" data-blocks='[["BL_621.8",621,[916,1557,750,558]]]'>¶ 29 We have affirmed, utilizing the doctrine of constructive possession, that Appellant possessed the sawed-off shotgun found behind the stereo system in the living room. The principle of constructive possession applies to Appellant’s possession of the drugs located in the living room and kitchen for purposes of section 9712.1. The sentencing court did not discuss this principle and did not apply it to the evidence presented at trial.</p>
    <p id="b621-10" data-blocks='[["BL_621.9",621,[916,2140,750,558]]]'>¶ 30 Finally, the sentencing court herein did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Sanes, <a href="/a2d/955/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="955 A.2d 369" data-case-ids="8209085" data-case-paths="/a2d/955/0369-01">supra,</a> </em>which was decided on August 4, 2008, when it imposed this April 2, 2008 sentence. In <em>Sanes, </em>we interpreted the meaning of “in close proximity” for purposes of application of section 9712.1. We gave that term a very expansive meaning and actually held that handguns found hidden in a closet were in close proximity to drugs found in the same room.</p>

      <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>¶ 31 We also applied federal cases interpreting a sentencing provision that had the same purpose as the one herein as well as Pennsylvania decisions determining the meaning of the term “in close proximity” in another statutory provision, the Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6801. At section 6801(a)(6)(ii), the Forfeiture Act states that where money or negotiable instruments are found “in close proximity” to illegally-possessed drugs, there is a rebut-table presumption that those items were the proceeds of unlawful drug sales and thus, subject to forfeiture. In two cases interpreting the Forfeiture Act, <em>Commonwealth v. Heater, </em><a href="/a2d/899/1126-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="899 A.2d 1126" data-case-ids="8422759" data-case-paths="/a2d/899/1126-01">899 A.2d 1126</a> (Pa.Super.2006), and <em>Commonwealth v. Giffin, </em><a href="/pa-super/407/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="407 Pa.

That interpretive case law has a significant impact on the application of section 9712.1 to this case.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[190,1580,754,1102]]]'>¶ 32 In summary, we believe that a new sentencing hearing is required in light of 1) the sentencing court’s misapprehension regarding the binding effect of the jury verdict with respect to the drugs found in the kitchen and living room; 2) its failure to acknowledge the principle of constructive possession regarding Appellant’s possession of those drugs; 3) its lack of consideration of all the evidence presented at trial for purposes of determining whether Appellant constructively possessed the drugs found in his house for purposes of applying section 9712.1; and 4) promulgation of interpretive guidance from this Court as to the meaning of “in close proximity” in section 9712.1. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing so that the sentencing court can correctly determine application of section 9712.1 to this case.</p>

The testimony adduced by the Commonwealth indicated that all that correspondence was addressed to Appellant, and Appellant answered the door. Police records indicated that 657 Clinton Street was Appellant’s address, and Appellant’s father was not at that location when the warrant was executed. Thus, we conclude that the letters, bills, and other documents with Appellant’s name that were found at 657 Clinton Street belonged to Appellant rather than his father.</p>
