The question we must decide is whether a receiver appointed under the Act may be sued for alleged damages arising from the manner in which it carries out its duties, or whether it is entitled to the protection of “quasi-judicial” immunity. On the strength of ample decisional authority in similar contexts, we conclude that a receiver named under the Act is immune from suit for damages when acting within the scope of its appointment. Because the complaint in this case did not allege that Shannon &amp; Luchs exceeded that authority, but only that it failed to collect the rents diligently, the trial court correctly dismissed the action.</p>

This distinction is neither accurate nor sound. In <em>Property Management &amp; Investment Inc., supra, </em>for example, the receiver was alleged to have released defamatory reports to the news media and converted and embezzled property of the corporation. The court observed that the activities alleged all involved decisions by the receiver “in the course of administering the receivership,” activities not <em>“prima facie </em>beyond the scope of the official function of a state court receiver.” Since nothing in the complaint “indicated that [the receiver] had acted outside his authority and thus was not immune from suit,” the court held the action was properly dismissed. <a href="/f2d/752/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="752 F.2d 599" data-case-ids="297049" data-case-paths="/f2d/752/0599-01">752 F.2d at 599</a>. <em>See also Drexler v.

Thus, although the cases cited do sometimes note that the receiver acted carefully or faithfully, they do not consider first whether the receiver acted with due care and <em>only then </em>whether immunity was appropriate; that would be an odd manner of analysis rendering the immunity issue essentially moot. The rule to be gleaned from these decisions is that, when a receiver acts within the scope of its authority, confining itself to the duties of its office, it shares the immunity of the appointing judge even though it is alleged to have acted wrongly in performing those duties. <em>See Spalding v. Vilas, </em><a href="/us/161/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="161 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="5701729" data-case-paths="/us/161/0483-01">161 U.S. 483</a>, 498, <a href="/us/161/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="161 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="5701729" data-case-paths="/us/161/0483-01">16 S.Ct. 631</a>, 637, <a href="/us/161/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="161 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="5701729" data-case-paths="/us/161/0483-01">40 L.Ed. 780</a> (1896) (act is within official’s jurisdiction if not “manifestly or palpably beyond his authority”).

    <p id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[988,435,752,1660]]]'>Although unnecessary to our decision, we note two additional factors which strengthen our conclusion in favor of immunity for receivers under the Act. First, courts upholding immunity for receivers have recognized that denial of immunity “would make the receiver a lightning rod for harassing litigation aimed at judicial orders.” <em>Kermit Constr. Corp., supra, </em><a href="/f2d/547/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="547 F.2d 1" data-case-ids="998984" data-case-paths="/f2d/547/0001-01">547 F.2d at 3</a>; <em>T &amp; W Investment Co., supra, </em><a href="/f2d/588/0801-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="588 F.2d 801" data-case-ids="832095" data-case-paths="/f2d/588/0801-01">588 F.2d at 802</a>. This concern is not misplaced in the present context. A receiver appointed under the Act replaces the landlord/owner as the sole person entitled to receive direct payments of rent. The owner therefore suffers a loss of control until the arrearages have been satisfied. D.C.Code § 43-543(b). As <em>Shannon &amp; Luchs v. Jeter, <a href="/a2d/469/0812-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="469 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="7978206" data-case-paths="/a2d/469/0812-01">supra,</a> </em>made clear, the purpose of the Act is not to protect the interests of the landlord. Its purpose is to protect conscientious tenants from the loss of utility services and utility companies from nonpayment for services they are required to provide. <a href="/a2d/469/0812-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="469 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="7978206" data-case-paths="/a2d/469/0812-01">469 A.2d at 813</a>. In these circumstances, the potential for hostility by the landlord toward the receiver is apparent; unhappy at being ousted from management of its property to begin with, the landlord may easily grow to believe that the receiver is indifferent to its interests and concerned only with collecting enough rents to pay the utility bills and its own fees and expenses. The risk of unjustified litigation is thus substantial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The Act provides that the court “shall require accountings to be made by the receiver at such times as the Court <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>determines to be just, reasonable and necessary.” D.C.Code § 43-543(a)(4). Although the landlord may not bring suit to collect rents from tenants during the receivership, <em><a href="/a2d/469/0812-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="469 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="7978206" data-case-paths="/a2d/469/0812-01">id.</a> </em>at § 43-543(d), nothing would bar the landlord from petitioning the court for an accounting if there is reason to believe the receiver is negligent in performing its duties. Since the statute does not envision excluding the landlord from all involvement in the receivership, <em>see Shannon &amp; Luchs v. Jeter, <a href="/a2d/469/0812-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="469 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="7978206" data-case-paths="/a2d/469/0812-01">supra</a> </em>(receiver must join landlord as indispensable party-plaintiff in action for possession), there is no reason to suppose that courts will turn a deaf ear to legitimate grievances by the landlord about the receiver’s stewardship.</p>

We do not, of course, question the sincerity with which appellant brought this action; on the present record, we must take the allegations of the complaint as true. We also do not deprecate the valid proprietary interest the landlord maintains in vigilant collection of the rents even though it has been supplanted by a receiver under the Act. The practical reality, however, is that implementation of this statute designed to meet an exceptional situation must inevitably depend on the readiness of outside property managers to accept appointment under the Act. The continuing risk of suit at the hands of a dissatisfied owner is a deterrent to such cooperation that cannot be ignored.</p>
