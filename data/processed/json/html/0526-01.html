He argues that the trial court should have excluded this evidence because the police obtained it as a result of a war-rantless entry into his aunt and uncle’s apartment. The government replies that appellant lacks standing to object to the warrantless entry. We conclude that the record requires us to hold that appellant has standing.

At about 6:00 p.m. on May 1, 1990, Officer Rene Davis of the Metropolitan Police Department, working undercover, saw appellant come out of an apartment building and walk toward another at 3253 23rd Street, S.E.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Officer Davis signalled to appellant that she wished to purchase rock cocaine. Appellant motioned to her to approach. Officer Davis did so and asked appellant if she could buy two $20 pieces of rock cocaine. Officer Davis and appellant then went into the 23rd Street apartment building where, on the landing between the second and third floors, the officer gave appellant $40 in prerecorded bills in exchange for two plastic bags of rock substances. While this transaction was taking place, a door opened to apartment 24 on the second floor, and a woman asked appellant if he wanted her to leave the door unlocked. He said no. Officer Davis then asked appellant whether he would still be there if she came back in five minutes, to which appellant replied that he would either be “out here” or in the apartment where the woman was. He also told Officer Davis that, because he had a key, he did not know why the woman had asked him if he wanted her to leave the door unlocked. Officer Davis then returned to her car and radioed to an arrest team, reporting that she had just made a drug purchase and describing the seller<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and where he could be found.</p>
    <p id="b578-12" data-blocks='[["BL_578.7",578,[1009,408,749,1326]]]'>Two members of the arrest team, Officer Calvin Jones and Sergeant Joseph Zovak, then entered the apartment building and, not seeing the subject in the hallway, knocked at the apartment indicated by Officer Davis. According to Officer Jones, a woman<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> answered the door, and Sergeant Zovak announced that they were police officers looking for a suspect in relation to a narcotics offense. There is no indication in the record that the officers ever obtained or displayed a warrant either to arrest appellant or to search apartment 24. Officer Jones testified that the woman opened the door, stepped back, and said “Okay,” admitting the officers into the apartment. As the officers crossed the threshold, they saw appellant walking into the living room. They approached appellant, detained him, and patted him down, finding nothing. They then escorted him outside the apartment to the street, where Officer Davis, riding by, identified appellant as the person who had sold her the cocaine. Appellant was placed under arrest, and Officer Green, the transport officer, searched him, finding a ziplock bag containing a piece of rock cocaine in appellant’s pants pocket.</p>

After returning home from work he had gone to the store. On his way back from the store he passed by his aunt’s <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>apartment at 3253 23rd Street on the 22nd Street side; she was in the window and asked him for a cigarette. Appellant went up to her apartment and began talking with his aunt and uncle there. Appellant stated that he did not make it “a habit” to go over to his aunt’s, but he did “check on” his uncle and aunt “once or twice a week.” A minute or thirty seconds after he arrived at the apartment there was a knock on the door. Appellant testified that he opened the door and that police officers appeared with handguns and shotguns. The officers did not display any warrant, nor did they request permission to enter the apartment, although they did identify themselves as police. They pushed their way inside the apartment, and one man grabbed appellant by his shirt, shoved him up against a wall, proceeded to search appellant’s pockets and socks, and then opened and dropped appellant’s pants. One of the officers told appellant he was not under arrest but asked him to walk outside. The officer then escorted appellant outside the apartment building while holding onto him by the back of his pants.</p>
    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[186,1526,746,654]]]'>Appellant’s uncle, Samuel Rose, testified both at the suppression hearing and at trial. He said that he lives with his sister Betty Jean Mack, appellant’s aunt, at 3253 23rd Street, S.E. He added that appellant visited the apartment every other day, or once or twice a week. Rose also testified that he visited appellant at the home of appellant’s mother, where appellant lived. Rose confirmed that appellant had opened the door when there was a knock and that the police officers then rushed in, pinned appellant against the wall, and searched him, dropping appellant’s trousers.</p>

The court credited appellant’s testimony that appellant, not a woman (as Officer Jones had testified), had answered the door when the police knocked. The court did not make any finding as to whether appellant or anyone else had consented to the officers’ entry into the apartment. The court did find, however, that the “combination of [the] description [given by Officer Davis] as well as the physical location [was] more than enough to establish probable cause.” The court also found that there were exigent circumstances, not in the sense that there was imminent danger, but insofar as the police needed to prevent destruction of evidence and make an identification, because “the police don’t know who this guy is.” The court ruled that under these circumstances the police, upon seeing appellant across the threshold, had probable cause or at least reasonable suspicion that justified taking appellant into custody. Moreover, the court “seriously questioned] the [appellant’s] having any standing about being hauled out of his aunt’s home under those circumstances,” although the court did not make a formal finding as to whether appellant had standing to object to the warrant-less entry. Finally, the court concluded that even if there had been an unlawful arrest, the subsequent identification procedure was not tainted because the undercover officer had had plenty of opportunity to observe appellant.</p>

The trial court’s failure to consider appellant’s standing in more detail, however, may have been due, at least in part, to the government’s failure to contest standing at the outset. Although appellant, in his motion • to suppress, alleged that he had “standing to challenge the legality of the entry,” the government’s opposition did not contest standing. Indeed, the government did not even mention standing until the prosecutor did so briefly in oral argument at the end of the suppression hearing. Defense counsel at that point indicated she had understood the government was conceding the issue—an understanding that may have caused counsel to fail to present additional evidence.</p>

In principle, of course, the trial court—not the appellate court—finds facts.

We did not intend our ruling in <em>Martin, </em>nor do we understand the Supreme Court’s holding in <em>Olson, </em>to mean that overnight guest status, at the very least, is a <em>sine qua non </em>of standing to challenge a search or seizure in a residence other than one’s own home.

The government urges affirmance and has selected the arguments it believes are best suited to achieve that end: (1) lack of standing to seek suppression of evidence based on a warrantless entry, coupled with (2) admission of identification and physical evidence based, respectively, on <em>Terry </em>and probable cause. Far from confessing error, the government has vigorously argued for affir-mance. Once the government has thereby assumed its traditional role of advocate, rather than the unusual stance of error-confessor, the adversary system should be allowed to function as such; the court no longer is needed, automatically, to act as an institutional failsafe to make sure that the government has not compromised its prosecutorial responsibility.</p>

The fact that the government relies exclusively on alleged lack of standing, a procedural argument, without an accompanying merits defense of the trial court’s suppression ruling in case the standing argument fails, does not transform the government’s argument for affirmance into a confession of error.</p>

The premise underlying this approach is a belief, traceable to old English caselaw, that the court’s reliance on a government confession of error would establish a legal precedent embracing appellant’s argument, and that the court, not the prosecutor, should be the institution performing the evaluative function that announces the law. <em>See Parlton, </em><a href="/citations/?q=64%20App.%20D.C.%20169" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="64 App. D.C. 169">64 App.D.C. at 169</a>, <a href="/f2d/75/0772-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="75 F.2d 772" data-case-ids="961285" data-case-paths="/f2d/75/0772-01">75 F.2d at 772</a>; <em>see also Young, </em><a href="/us/315/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="315 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="374771" data-case-paths="/us/315/0257-01">315 U.S. at 259</a>, <a href="/us/315/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="315 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="374771" data-case-paths="/us/315/0257-01">62 S.Ct. at 512</a>. This rationale is not necessarily convincing, however, because a reviewing court can expressly agree to honor a confession of error, for policy reasons, without necessarily reaching the merits of appellant’s contentions and announcing them as precedent. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself — both before and after <em>Young </em>— has reversed criminal convictions merely on a confession of error without evidencing any opinion about the merits. <em>See Casey v.

Appellant said he went inside the apartment to give her the cigarettes and planned to “come right back out” because his two friends were waiting. Appellant testified that he visited his aunt and uncle once or twice a week to check on them, but that he did not “make it a habit.” According to appellant, he was there only a minute or thirty seconds before the police knocked. Appellant’s uncle, Samuel Rose, testified that he had not expected appellant to visit that day. There was testimony that while appellant and the undercover officer were conversing in the hallway, a woman opened the door to the apartment and asked appellant if he wanted her to leave the door open. Appellant responded, “No, I’m coming in.” Appellant extended the undercover officer an invitation to return to the area or to the apartment for more drugs.

The circumstances under which appellant obtained any key and the extent to which he was authorized by the lawful occupant of the premises to use it were not in evidence. Furthermore, the statement of the woman apparently in charge of the premises was contrary to appellant’s assertion that he had a key.
