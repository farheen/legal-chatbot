She appeals from the trial court’s order dismissing, with prejudice, the action in which she sought to pursue a claim that the defendant hospital and obstetrician performed the assisted delivery without her informed consent. The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that Miller-McGee had failed to amend her complaint to add the lack of informed consent claim after the court had dismissed her other claims. In light of the procedural history of this case, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the suit without affording Miller-McGee an opportunity to amend her complaint. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>

During the delivery, she suffered a large tear of her vagina that was caused by her baby being pulled through her vaginal canal with forceps. The tear developed into a rectovaginal fistula,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> causing appellant to have uncontrollable bowel movements through her vagina. She underwent two surgical procedures to correct the problem. On October 31, 2003, she filed a two-count amended complaint in the Superior Court against defendants/appellees Washington Hospital Center Corporation and Dr. Scott Muangman,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> alleging medical malpractice-negligence (Count I) and negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count II).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The trial court dismissed <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>Count II after defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss that count.</p>

On April 11, 2005, the trial court issued its order dismissing the negligent delivery claim. Noting that Miller-McGee contended that her injuries were caused by her child having been delivered forcibly with forceps, the court found that there was no question that expert testimony would have been required to determine the standard of care and to establish what constituted the proper use of force in the delivery of a child. As to Miller-McGee’s theory that appellees failed to obtain her informed consent to the assisted vaginal delivery that was performed, the court stated, “[wjhile Plaintiffs complaint fails to mention a lack of informed consent it is the Court’s understanding that Defendants had notice of this theory, as evident by their Interrogatory Requests of Plaintiff.... Defendants were further put on notice of this theory during the deposition of Defendant Muangman, if not earlier.” The court also found that an “expert opinion was not necessary for the Plaintiffs claim of lack of informed consent.” Accordingly, the court’s April 11, 2005 order granted only partial summary judgment to defendants, stating that “[pjlaintiff may go forward with the lack of informed consent issue only.”</p>

Moreover, Plaintiff cannot prove that had she been informed of the risk of vaginal laceration, she would not have consented to the assisted vaginal delivery of her child. As demonstrated by the testimony of Defendants’ expert witness, upon whom Plaintiff intends to rely to support her claim of Lack of Informed Consent, an expectant mother is not routinely given the option of a caesarian section. There must be a medical indication for surgery. In this case a caesarian section was not medically indicated. Therefore, the risk of laceration, and more specifically, rectovaginal tear, was not considered to be a material risk.... Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot prove that the risk of laceration was a material risk and that had she been so advised, she would not have consented to the assisted vaginal delivery of her child.</blockquote>

As a result of my discussions, I was led to believe that I would either have a normal delivery or if complications arose, I would have a caesarian birth. At no time did anyone discuss a vaginally assisted birth with me, and at no time did anyone discuss with me the possibility of a recto-vaginal tear that could result from a vaginally assisted birth. No one advised me that as a result of a recto-vaginal tear that I could potentially lose control of my bowels and have uncontrollable bowel movements from my vagina.

Appellant’s argument is not without support in our case law. Our cases hold that, on appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we “must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” <em>Haymon v.

We can discern no reason why it would not have been appropriate for the court to afford Miller-McGee an opportunity to amend her pleadings to conform them to the theory of liability that had emerged during discovery.

Whether or not an informed consent claim had been asserted, communications between physician and patient prior to the surgery would be a prime subject of inquiry. Defense counsel would need to learn what the physician said in obtaining the patient’s consent to the surgery, because counsel would need to know, for example, whether the physician said anything — e.g., about the condition of the patient, the surgery to be performed, or the risks involved — that could be evidence of negligence on the physician’s part.

    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[198,315,753,553]]]'>For me, the crucial procedural fact is that appellant never sought leave to amend her complaint. “A [trial] court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the [trial] court.” <em>Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Industries America Corp., </em><a href="/f3d/314/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="314 F.3d 541" data-case-ids="9383117" data-case-paths="/f3d/314/0541-01">314 F.3d 541</a>, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>
    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.6",479,[201,895,753,1218]]]'>Stepping back for a moment, it is clear to me that the present (amended) complaint <em>does not </em>allege that the doctor proceeded without the patient’s informed consent. Those words do not appear in the complaint, nor is that claim fairly inferred from the words that do appear. <em>See Cleary v. Group Health Ass’n, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/691/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="691 A.2d 148" data-case-ids="11911680" data-case-paths="/a2d/691/0148-01">691 A.2d 148</a>, 155 (D.C.1997) (“informed consent claims concern a duty of the physician which is completely separate and distinct from his responsibility to skillfully diagnose and treat the patient’s ills” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also note 3, <em>supra </em>(quoting from amended complaint). We may have “liberal” rules of pleading, <em>see generally In re Estate of Curseen, </em><a href="/a2d/890/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="890 A.2d 191" data-case-ids="8990307" data-case-paths="/a2d/890/0191-01">890 A.2d 191</a> (D.C. 2006), but Civil Rule 8 still requires “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]” Super. Ct. Civ. R. 8(a)(2). The complaint in this case fails even that very lenient test.</p>
    <p id="b479-6" data-blocks='[["BL_479.7",479,[203,2145,750,401]]]'>It is not enough that appellant articulated that theory in discovery. She still is required to plead it, and deposition testimony and answers to interrogatories are not pleadings. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. Civ. R. 7(a). This is not a technicality, but rather a fundamental principle of our rules for conducting civil litigation.</p>
    <p id="b479-7" data-blocks='[["BL_479.8",479,[205,2570,749,90]],["BL_479.9",479,[998,250,752,554]]]'>The majority acknowledges what it calls “the prevalent rule,” that “[a]bsent exceptional circumstances, a [trial] court has no obligation to invite a plaintiff to amend his or her complaint when the plaintiff has not sought such amendment.” <em>Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., </em><a href="/f3d/360/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="360 F.3d 220" data-case-ids="2164190" data-case-paths="/f3d/360/0220-01">360 F.3d 220</a>, 242 (1st Cir.2004). We part company when the majority concludes that “exceptional circumstance[s]” are present here— that the trial court, in effect, “lulled” appellant into complacency. With respect, that conclusion is not fair to the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b479-9" data-blocks='[["BL_479.10",479,[1000,837,754,1385]]]'>It is true that the court’s order of April 11, 2005, stated that the plaintiff could “go forward on the lack of informed consent issue....” This ruling was based on the court’s conclusion that defendants “had notice of this theory” from discovery. If the trial court thereafter had changed its mind <em>sua sponte </em>and dismissed for failure to state a claim, that would have been unfair. But on April 28, 2005, appellees filed a renewed motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment arguing, among other things, that plaintiff was required <em>to plead </em>her claims and that her “failure to amend her complaint to allege Lack of Informed Consent is fatal.” Appellant responded on June 27, arguing first that appellees had been put on notice of that claim through discovery and also that “[i]n her complaint, the plaintiff clearly alleges medical negligence, and lack of informed [sic] is clearly a form of medical negligence.” Appellant had a full opportunity to brief the issue (and to make any related motions) before the court ruled (correctly, in my view) “that the Complaint did not state a claim for lack of informed consent.”</p>
    <p id="b479-10" data-blocks='[["BL_479.11",479,[1001,2256,755,402]],["BL_480.1",480,[215,244,759,872]]]'>Appellant may have been startled by that ruling, but she cannot claim unfair surprise. She knew her complaint had been attacked for failure to state a claim, and she was not entitled to assume that the trial court would deny the motion. Even if he chose to defend the complaint as drafted, a prudent attorney would have, <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>in the alternative, sought leave to amend if the court ruled otherwise. If he had not taken this precaution, the attorney could have filed a timely motion under Civil Rule 59 or 60, seeking leave to amend. At no time did appellant ask the trial court for leave to amend her complaint, and the trial court was not obliged to invite her to do so. <em>Karvelas, </em><a href="/f3d/360/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="360 F.3d 220" data-case-ids="2164190" data-case-paths="/f3d/360/0220-01">360 F.3d at 242</a>. <em>See also James Cape &amp; Sons Co. v. PCC Construction Co., </em><a href="/f3d/453/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="453 F.3d 396" data-case-ids="6046606" data-case-paths="/f3d/453/0396-01">453 F.3d 396</a>, 400-01 (7th Cir. 2006) (rejecting argument that “even though [plaintiff] did not properly request leave to amend its complaint, the district court was <em>required </em>by Rule 15 to dismiss without prejudice and/or <em>sua sponte </em>grant leave to amend the complaint”).</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[207,1143,761,1395]]]'>Under the circumstances, it is likely that the plain error standard governs our review instead of the already deferential abuse of discretion standard. I need not resolve that question, however, because the Superior Court neither abused its discretion nor committed plain error by failing to grant relief that was never requested. <em>See Greenidge v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em><a href="/f3d/446/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="446 F.3d 356" data-case-ids="2838828" data-case-paths="/f3d/446/0356-01">446 F.3d 356</a>, 361 (2d Cir.2006) (“a district court does not abuse its discretion when it fails to grant leave to amend a complaint without being asked to do so”); <em>Karvelas, </em><a href="/f3d/360/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="360 F.3d 220" data-case-ids="2164190" data-case-paths="/f3d/360/0220-01">360 F.3d at </a>242 n. 32 (deciding appeal without resolving whether court should review for plain error or abuse of discretion); <em>Emérito Estrada Rivera-Isuzu de P.R., Inc. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em><a href="/f3d/233/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="233 F.3d 24" data-case-ids="11171916" data-case-paths="/f3d/233/0024-01">233 F.3d 24</a>, 30 (1st Cir.2000) (pointing out that plaintiff did not amend complaint as of right — as it could have — or “formally ask the district court after judgment to permit such an amendment,” citing Rules 59 and 60; “we cannot say that the district court committed error, let alone plain error, by fading to <em>invite </em>Emérito to replead.”).</p>

I would not reach this complicated issue, however, because I would uphold the trial court’s dismissal of the complaint.</p>
