As we see it, they should have been given and the jury should have been charged that it might return the same or different verdicts as to the two defendants, even though both had previously been found negligent. The Trial Judge’s reasons for not permitting the jury to make separate determinations (as to whether Wells had assumed the risk of one defendant’s negligence but not that of the other) are set forth in his decision denying Best a new trial on this ground.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is clear that <a id="p1322" href="#p1322" data-label="1322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1322</a>he construed the prior jury’s finding that both defendants were equally responsible for causing plaintiff’s injuries, to lock defendants into an inseparable assumption-of-risk defense.

He equated findings of negligence as to each defendant with “shar[ing] equally the responsibility for ‘causing injuries to the plaintiffs’.” Yet a finding of assumption of risk as to one defendant’s negligence would have entitled it to be relieved of such responsibility. The Court concluded, as stated above, that the respective defenses could not be separately determined, but he should have distinguished the risks which Wells was alleged to have assumed resulting from the negligence of Massey-Ferguson in designing or manufacturing the combine from the negligence of Best while repairing or servicing it. Best was entitled to have that difference explained to the jury. Compare <em>Getty Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/372/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="372 A.2d 529" data-case-ids="8046780" data-case-paths="/a2d/372/0529-01">372 A.2d 529</a>, 533 (1977), in which this Court distinguished between the assumption of “risks incident to work at an oil refinery, where fires appear to be a common occurrence” and the assumption of risk of injury resulting from an explosion at the refinery caused by the negligence of its owner.

By its answer to interrogatory nineteen, the jury concluded that Best and Massey-Ferguson should share equally the responsibility for “causing injuries to the plaintiffs”. This finding does not relieve Wells of responsibility for his alleged assumption of risk upon an appropriate showing, but it does define the respective responsibilities of the defendants for the negligence found in interrogatories one and two. There is, thus, no “unsettled allocation-of-fault” and I do not infer from the Supreme Court’s use of that language a ruling to the contrary.’</blockquote>

But the second jury was faced with a single liability issue-whether plaintiff assumed the risk of working on a combine which a previous jury had determined was hazardous because of the joint negligence of the defendants. The first jury determined that such negligence proximately caused the accident and that the degrees of fault were equal. If the second jury had determined that plaintiff had assumed the risk of that dangerous situation, both defendants would have been released from responsibility for his injuries. Similarly, since the jury here concluded that plaintiff did not assume the risk, the previously determined finding of joint and equal liability must control the award.”</blockquote>
