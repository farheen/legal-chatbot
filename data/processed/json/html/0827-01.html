Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment charged defendant with murder and robbery, respectively. In addition, count 7, which was severed from the other counts eight months after the indictment, charged defendant with the unlawful possession of a firearm. The defendant was tried on counts 1 and 2 of the indictment in May 1982, was found guilty of both counts, and on June 28, 1982, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the felony murder. Thereafter, this court held that the robbery conviction, on which defendant had not been sentenced, had merged with the felony murder, and ordered that the robbery conviction be vacated. <em>State v.

After defendant’s conviction for felony-murder, defendant perfected a timely appeal.

On October 7, 1983, DiBiase moved to place count 7 upon the trial calendar, but 1983 ended without the case’s being called for trial.</p>

On that date DiBiase was allowed to withdraw as defendant’s counsel apparently for medical reasons, and Attorney Merlyn O’Keefe (O’Keefe) was subsequently appointed to represent defendant.</p>

The motion, however, scheduled for a hearing in Kent County on November 29,1984, was passed at that time because the case file was in Providence County.

During the spring of 1985 the case apparently was not called for trial, but on June 26, 1985, per order of then-Presiding Justice Gianinni, the case (apparently at Kent County) was transferred back to Providence County for prosecution during the summer months. Once again, however, the summer passed without the case’s being tried. Despite its “priority trial status” upon its return to Kent County in the fall of 1985, the case was not reached on the September 26,1985 trial calendar, and another year passed without a trial on count 7.</p>

The motion justice, however, refused to entertain an oral motion and'instead offered defendant the choice of proceeding to the prescheduled October 30,1986 trial <em>pro se </em>or vacating the trial date in order to have an opportunity to obtain new counsel. The defendant commented that he did not think his interests would be served if he acted <em>pro se; </em>he reiterated his desire to be heard on a motion to dismiss and requested an opportunity to obtain a list of attorneys from the Rhode Island Bar Association. The motion justice thereafter vacated the trial date pending defendant’s submission of a list of three potential attorneys.

Although the case had been transferred to the Superior Court pursuant to this court’s February 1983 remand order, as of late October 1986, the hearing on the motion for a new trial still had not been held. At that point it was finally discovered that, except for an initial motion for new trial on the felony-murder conviction, heard and decided in 1982, no subsequent <a id="p830" href="#p830" data-label="830" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*830</a>motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was ever filed by defendant’s successive attorneys.

The defendant appealed that ruling, and the case, as it pertained to the felony-murder conviction, was returned to this court for further proceedings.

The order specified that no continuances would be granted to either side. On April 30,1990, defendant filed a motion to dismiss count 7 on speedy-trial grounds.

In particular, the state points to (1) defendant’s motion to sever count 7 from the remaining counts, (2) defendant’s multiple changes of attorneys, (3) his delay in selecting a possible replacement attorney in 1986, and (4) his preoccupation with his felony-murder appeal.

At the time the public defender withdrew his representation in 1983, count 7 had been pending for two years without having been reached for trial. Moreover, when DiBiase replaced the public defender, he immediately placed the case upon the trial calendar, and O’Keefe, within six months of his appointment as counsel, filed a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial and shortly thereafter made several discovery motions, all in an effort to resolve the charge against defendant. In its brief, the state alleged that O’Keefe asked that count 7 be postponed during the summer of 1984. Even were we to assume, however, that such a request were made, we are of the opinion that the three months required to prepare the case, viewed in light of the overall course of the case, caused such a modest delay that it weighs only slightly against defendant.</p>

Nevertheless, such inaction on defendant’s part must be balanced against the inaction by the state. At no time during this period did the state take an affirmative action to press forward on the prosecution of the case. Despite the inaction on count 7, another unrelated outstanding charge against defendant was resolved during the pendency of count 7. The state is “not entitled to sit back and rely on its pro forma notice of readiness [for trial]; it owe[s] the additional duty of monitoring the case and pressing the court for a reasonably prompt trial.” <em>United States v.

A second motion to dismiss was made nearly two years later, when defendant made an oral, <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss at an October 7, 1986 hearing in Superior Court. The motion was not recognized by the court at that time, but the record clearly demonstrates defendant’s concern that his right to a speedy trial remain protected. During that hearing, defendant asked: “By holding my cases in abeyance [pending the appointment of a new attorney] * * * are my rights to a speedy trial still protected?” Apparently, defendant believed that his right had been preserved by a previously filed motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. When defendant agreed to have an October 80, 1986 trial date vacated, he stated, “Like I said before, I agree with your Honor, * * * and just for the record * * * I still agree with the motion filed many months ago for a speedy trial.”</p>

Because the line of cross-examination during the felony-murder trial made reference to defendant’s past criminal activity, defendant was compelled to forego reading the cross-examination in order to avoid prejudicing the jury. This prior testimony, therefore, was damaging to defendant.
