After hearing the arguments of counsel and the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown.</p>
    <p id="b1410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1410.5",1410,[179,561,759,802]]]'>Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and its related companies (Liberty) seek review of a determination by the Workers’ Compensation Appellate Division that it would not stay an action filed in the Workers’ Compensation Court for collection of $2,063,407.58 from Liberty as an assessment based upon premiums earned by Liberty during the calendar year 1991. It is undisputed that Liberty was in the business of writing workers’ compensation insurance during that year. This assessment is collected from all insurance companies who write workers’ compensation insurance as a means of defraying expenses of the workers’ compensation administrative fund. The action was brought by the administrator of the fund.</p>
