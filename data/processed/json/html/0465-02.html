Certainly the information that the man E.Y. believed to be her husband but who, as Respondent knew, was not in fact her husband, and the information relating to J.C.’s ongoing property settlement discussions with his wife L.F-C. were material to E.Y.’s decisions. In preparing a will for E.Y., Respondent had a duty to advise E.Y. of all information material to her decision concerning how to dispose of her property upon her death. Yet, as Respondent concedes, she had a duty not to disclose precisely this information because it was a confidence learned from her client, J.C. Her duties to her respective clients thus were irreconcilable and resulted in a conflict of interest. Respondent could not possibly have undertaken to represent E.Y. unless and until she obtained E.Y.’s consent following a full disclosure of the possible effect of such representation on the exercise of her independent professional judgment on behalf of each, which Respondent failed to do. She accordingly violated DR 5-105(A).</p>

It well may be, as Respondent argues before the Board, citing a single case from Arkansas, that legal representation involved in drafting a will generally ends when the will is executed, but such a principle does not fit a situation in which a client executes a will that the lawyer knows is ill-informed because the client has not been given relevant information that the lawyer is holding in confidence. Respondent held the original of that ill-informed will in her firm’s safe, knowing that her client, E.Y., was at risk of being left without means if J.C. died. Respondent also was actively engaged in the divorce and property settlement negotiations of J.C. and L.F-C.

Respondent initially disregarded the conflict of interest rules and dishonesty rule thinking that writing a will for E.Y. and naming herself as the executor of J.C.’s will would be quick fixes to her client/Mend J.C.’s problem. In mid-1987, that problem appeared correctable in the near future: J.C. would obtain a divorce from his first wife and then inform E.Y. of this fact. Unfortunately for Respondent, J.C. could not follow through. He did not finalize his divorce from L. FC. for seven years and he had a baby by his legal wife, L.F-C., in the interim. What started out as a small lie to help J.C. and to give protection to E.Y. and her child mushroomed into a mountain of ethical problems, which Respondent compounded by not withdrawing from the representation each time the ethical warning lights flashed.

In her first brush with the disciplinary system, Jones-Terrell, a relatively inexperienced attorney, was found to have made direct contact with an elderly neighbor and friend of the family who was represented by another attorney and who was considered to be incapacitated person regarding her potential employment as her lawyer and about living rent-free in her house. Jones-Terrell persuaded the woman to sign an agreement to change attorneys and let the respondent and her husband live rent-free in her house. Jones-Terrell was further found to have made misrepresentations to the Court, by way of omission and misstatement, about her actions with respect to her client and to have taken $250 of the woman’s funds for questionable expenses.

The Court ordered a 60-day suspension, even though the conduct by the lawyer was financially self-interested: She and her husband moved in the incapacitated Ghent’s home without paying rent and took on the representation of the client, who already had a lawyer, “thus making improper contact regarding representation, and engaging in a prohibited business transaction with a chent, without full disclosure, or fair and reasonable terms.” <a href="/a2d/712/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="712 A.2d 496" data-case-ids="11814780" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0496-01">712 A.2d at 600</a>.

The client and her husband lent the respondent and his then wife $21,500 to help him satisfy past tax obligations. McLain did not explain to the clients at the time of the loan that their interests were different or advise the clients to have the promissory note reviewed by another Attorney. McLain failed to repay the loan when requested to do so. Three years later, McLain asked his clients for another loan, this time to purchase a house. The clients refused the loan but offered to buy the house and let respondent repurchase it with future earnings from his law practice. McLain continued in an attorney-client relationship with the clients, and again, McLain failed to advise the clients of their legal rights. When McLain failed to make the payments due to cover the expenses of the mortgage and taxes, the clients severed their relationship and sued McLain for possession of the <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>house and back rent. A settlement was reached on the house and the $21,500 loan.</p>

Two members of the Board who have filed a separate dissent on the issue of the appropriate sanction, argue in part that Respondent’s misconduct, which did not result in any legal or financial harm to her client, should not be sanctioned more severely than the respondent’s misconduct in <em>Jones-Terrell.</em>
