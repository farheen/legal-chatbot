Frank Eco-nomides argues that it does. The District argues that it does not. We agree with the District.

Specifically, the permit stated that it was for “renovation &amp; addition to single family dwelling as per plans.” On or about December 12, 2002 — -within about sixteen days after receiving the permit issued to renovate and build an addition— Economides, without seeking modification of the permit, had the house razed in preparation for beginning work on a new house to be built on the same site.</p>

On the basis of this review, he informed Eco-nomides that before the new home construction had begun in the Spring of 2003, he should have had his building permit (# B425076) amended to read: “Construction of New Single Family Dwelling.” On July 2, 2003, DCRA issued an amended building permit (#B452810) to Econom-ides that read: “Revision to Bldg.

Eco-nomides moved to dismiss the Information on the grounds that he had obtained amendments to the permit which retroactively cured any defects that had existed in the original November 26, 2002 permit (# B425076). The trial court granted that request in a March 21, 2008, order, holding that the permit issued on December 20, 2004 (# B468560), retroactively cured any defects that existed in the original November 26, 2002, permit, and thus that Eco-nomides now had a valid permit for the demolition and new home construction that took place. In the court’s words, “the DCRA decision to amend the original work permit relates back and excuses the defendant’s conduct.” As we discuss, we conclude that this reasoning was erroneous.</p>

OAG, on the other hand, interprets the language, “Once such amendments are approved and their revision permit is issued,” to mean “that the original permit and the revised permit should be read together for administrative purposes prospectively.” Thus, this case raises the issue of whether retroactive authorization of construction work by DCRA can deprive OAG of its statutory authority to bring criminal charges for violations of the Construction Codes.

In other words, his position is that the late-obtained permit acts retroactively to cure any Code violations for Building Without a Permit that took place between the issuance of the original permit and the issuance of the amended permit, so long as the construction is sanctioned by the amended permit. The District, however, disagrees that an amended permit cures prior violations and precludes prosecution for Building Without a Permit. Put another way, the District takes the position that the Attorney General retains the power to prosecute an owner for failing to obtain a proper permit before proceeding with construction work.</p>

But what he ignores is the fact that if, as the government alleges, he proceeded with the building of his new house before he had a permit that authorized him to do so, he was violating the law. Should that be found to be the case, it was Economides, who by flouting the regulations, provided the Attorney General with good cause to exercise classic prosecutorial discretion to determine whether or not his failure to obtain a permit merited prosecution. Indeed, “so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute [or regulation], the decision of whether or not to prosecute, and what charges to file ... generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion.” <em>United States v.
