Gen. Laws 1927) even though the agreement to assume is contained in an instrument under seal. See American Surety Co. v. Smith, 130 So. R. 441; Starbird v.

The latter rule rests upon the ancient maxim: <em>“Falsa demónstrate non </em>nocet”—a false description does not render a deed or other writing inoperative. See 25 C. J. 435.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[226,1048,1115,1106]]]'>It is said in Greenleaf on Evidence (16th Ed.) 297, quoting Lord Bacon’s rule: “ * * * there be two sorts of ambiguities of words; the one is <em>ambiguitas patens </em>and the other <em>latens.

F. and his heirs, here appeareth no ambiguity at all. But if the truth be, that I have the manors both of South S. and North S., this ambiguity is matter of fact;. and therefore it shall be holpen by averment, whether (which) of them it was that the party intended should pass.” That portion of the rule relating to patent ambiguities is now somewhat relaxed. 22 C.

The rule, in such cases, is derived from the maxim, <em>‘Falsa demonstration non nocet, cum de cor pore </em>constatHere so much of the description as is false is rejected; and the instrument will take effect, if a sufficient description remains to ascertain its application.
