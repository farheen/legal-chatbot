(ISS), appeals the order of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas denying its petition to amend complaint and granting summary judgment in favor of Appellee, Jonathan Platt. We conclude that transactions completed after a party’s foreign corporate charter was revoked do not fall within the ambit of Section 4141 of the Pennsylvania Foreign Business Corporations Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and therefore reverse and remand.</p>

On June 30, 1994, ISS’s New Jersey charter was revoked. On August 22, 1994, Appellee finalized an agreement to buy ISS’s business assets, including licenses, copyrights, and customer lists for a computer program created by Appellant. Over the years, Appellee paid $150,000 to Appellant, but refused to pay the remaining $200,000 because of his contention that Appellant violated the agreement by failing to provide a complete user manual for the computer program. Appellant filed a Complaint in Confession of Judgment in 1994. Judgment was entered, but was subsequently opened on January 10, 2005 upon Appellee’s petition. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Appellant had no standing to sue him in Pennsylvania. Appellant responded by filing a petition to amend its complaint to change the plaintiff from “Information Systems Service, Inc.” to “Jack Liberi t/a Information Systems Service.” On June 27, 2006, the trial court issued an opinion and order granting Ap-pellee’s summary judgment motion and dismissing Appellant’s petition to amend <a id="p848" href="#p848" data-label="848" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*848</a>the complaint as moot. Judgment was entered in favor of Appellee on June 30, 2006, with Appellant’s timely notice of appeal and Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement filed thereafter.</p>

In evaluating the trial court’s decision to enter summary judgment, we focus on the legal standard articulated in the summary judgment rule, Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2 [Motion], The rule states that where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to relief as a matter of law, summary judgment may be entered. We will view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party.</blockquote>

However, it is undisputed that New Jersey revoked ISS’s corporate charter before the agreement for the sale of assets was completed. As the <em>Jacob’s </em>Court observed, when no corporation actually exists and only a sole proprietor was involved in the transaction, then the fictitious corporation and the sole proprietor are considered “one and the same.” <em>See Jacob’s, supra </em>at 496; <em>see also Waugh v. Steelton Taxicab Co., </em><a href="/pa/371/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="371 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1237101" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0436-01">371 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20527" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="89 A.2d 527">89 A.2d 527</a>, 529 (1952) (“In the case at bar no one other than Kosir (defendant) was ever involved because there was no entity as the Steelton Taxicab Company apart from the personality of Kosir.”) (emphasis in original). Therefore, if amendment will not alter the assets subject to liability, then there is no prejudice, and the petition to amend must be granted. <em>Jacobs, supra </em>at 496-97. Instantly, Appellant asserted that “there was no corporate entity apart from the personality of the owner, Jack Liberi, at that time [of the transaction]” and that amendment “would not alter assets subject to liability,” which claims were not disputed. (Appellant’s Petition for Leave to Amend Complaint, filed 2/23/06, at 2 ¶¶ 13-14). Accordingly, because Appellee transacted a deal with a non-existent corporation, ISS and Liberi are considered “one and the same” for purposes of the instant complaint, and Appellee is considered to have completed the transaction with Liberi. <em>See Jacobs, supra; Waugh, supra.</em>

    <p id="b883-8" data-blocks='[["BL_883.9",883,[985,1089,753,792]]]'>¶ 8 Appellee nonetheless asserts that Appellant was subject to Section 4141 by virtue of Liberi’s being the successor of the corporation. Appellee’s interpretation of Section 4141 is mistaken. The relevant provision states that no successor or assignee of the corporation may file suit on claims “arising out of the doing of business by the corporation in this Commonwealth until a certificate of authority has been obtained....” 15 Pa.C.S.A. § 4141(a). As we have determined above, the instant transaction did not involve a legitimate corporation. Accordingly, Section 4141’s provision regarding successors does not apply to Appellant’s complaint.</p>

        <em>. </em>We further observe that even if ISS was properly incorporated in New Jersey at the time of the sale, it is questionable whether ISS was actually “doing business in this Commonwealth." <em>See </em>15 Pa.C.S.A. § 4141(a).
