Appellants’ 1953 parent application, like the present application, describes certain linear, elastomeric, fluorinated copolymers and methods for vulcanizing or cross-linking those polymers to produce products of increased toughness and heat resistance, and lessened plasticity and solubility. According to appellants, the parent application has issued as <a href="/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%202%2C965%2C619" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="U.S. Patent No. 2,965,619">U.S. Patent No. 2,965,619</a> with claims drawn to <em>vulcanized </em>elastomers and processes of preparing them from the linear, fluorinated copolymers.</p>
    <p id="b793-4" data-blocks='[["BL_793.4",793,[96,685,1339,1040]]]'>The present application was originally filed with 13 claims drawn to certain of the <em>vulcanizable </em>elastomeric fluorinated copolymers disclosed therein. The examiner finally rejected all claims (now present, claims 1-12 and 14-16) as based on an insufficient disclosure and as unpatentable over two prior art patents <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to Dittman. Appellants appealed to the board; before its decision, the examiner reopened prosecution, citing a third patent to Rexford<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> against the claims. Appellants responded to that rejection by copying claims 1, 2 and 6-9 of Rexford into their application as present claims 17-22 and requested an interference be declared with Rexford. The examiner refused to institute interference proceedings, and entered a second final rejection of all claims, including claims 17-22, “as based on an insufficient disclosure,” “as being substantially met by Rexford” and “as unpatentable over either of the Dittman * * * patents.” A second appeal to the board ensued. In his Answer, the examiner-modified his position to the extent that, in addition to the insufficient, disclosure rejection of all claims, claims 1-3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14 and 17-22 were rejected as “fully met” by Rexford and claims 1-3, 5-9, 12, 14 and 17-22 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> were rejected “as unpatentable over” the Dittman patents. The board affirmed on all grounds. We shall consider each issue-separately.</p>

From the other description in the specification, we are informed that at least 10 percent of the carbon atoms in the linear chain of those copolymers must be -CH2- groups, thus effectively establishing, for example, that the copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and 2-chloroperfluoropropylene is composed of at least one molecule of vinylidene fluoride (CH2=CF2) for each four molecules of 2-chloroperfluoropropylene (CF3-CC1=CF2). When so constituted, those copolymers are said to be elastomeric (rubbery), chemically inert and electrically insulating.

The position of the Patent Office with regard to the “process of making” the invention is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the board states that “The method is not in issue,” and on the other that “catalytic phenomena are involved” and that the copolymers “would vary in characteristics depending on the par ticular selection of monomers and the conditions of polymerization.” While appellants have not set forth a full, detailed working example of the manner of making their copolymers, we are satisfied that sufficient working procedure has been set forth so that one skilled in the art may prepare the claimed copolymers without undue experimentation. We are supported in our conclusion by reference to the two Dittman patents in the record, which describe in detail the “water suspension” and “mass” polymerization <em>'processes </em>contemplated by appellants and indicate the general applicability of those processes to catalytic polymerization of a wide variety of fluorinated olefin monomer species, including many of the fluorinated propylenes and ethylenes recited by appellants here.

The provisions there quoted are similar in all material respects to the language employed by Congress in R.S. 4888, the progenitor of section 112. In <em>Lawson </em>v. Bruce, <a href="/ccpa/42-2/0893-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="42 C.C.P.A. 893" data-case-ids="6079039" data-case-paths="/ccpa/42-2/0893-01">42 CCPA 893</a>, <a href="/f2d/222/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="222 F.2d 273" data-case-ids="49539,6079039" data-case-paths="/f2d/222/0273-01,/ccpa/42-2/0893-01">222 F. 2d 273</a>, <a href="/ccpa/42-2/0893-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="42 C.C.P.A. 893" data-case-ids="6079039" data-case-paths="/ccpa/42-2/0893-01">105 USPQ 440</a>, we observed that there was no requirement in R.S.4888 or hr the Rules of Practice then in effect that a party relying on a constructive reduction to practice must show a specific embodiment or working example to support claimed compounds. As is evident from the excerpt from the decision of the Board of Patent Interferences which is quoted in <em>Lawson </em>v. Bruce, the Patent Office tribunals were then in agreement with that position, stating:</p>

As for identifying properties the decisions establish no uniform practice.

    <p id="b804-5" data-blocks='[["BL_804.7",804,[239,784,1327,829]]]'>At the present time, section 112, like its predecessor, makes no explicit requirement that a specific embodiment or working example is necessary to support claims to a composition of matter. Assuming the expressions “specific embodiment” and “working example” may be equated, as the Patent Office has evidently done here, present Rule 71(b) does make such a requirement, the language pertinent thereto to making its first appearance in the Buies of Practice effective March 1, 1949. The Buies of Practice, when not inconsistent with the statutes from which they are derived, have the force of law. 35 USC 6. To be consistent with section 112, the language in Buie 71(b) relating to a description of a “specific embodiment” should not be construed as requiring <em>more </em>description of the invention than is otherwise required by section 112. It is not within the province of the Patent Office or this court, in interpreting section 112 by rule or decision, to require more or accept less in the way of disclosure of an invention than Congress intended a specification shall contain.</p>
    <p id="b804-6" data-blocks='[["BL_804.8",804,[240,1627,1326,283]]]'>As to the fifst question decided in the majority opinion, concerning claims 1-7, 10,11 and 14-16,1 agree with the reasoning and conclusions set forth in the majority opinion that the terms of section 112 are satisfied. As Buie 71(b) cannot in my view require more in the way of a disclosure, the inquiry is at an end and the board’s decision as to those claims cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b804-7" data-blocks='[["BL_804.9",804,[239,1925,1326,143]]]'>For the above reasons, I concur in the reversal of the board’s decision as to claims 1-7, 10, 11 and 14-16. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the majority as to claims 8, 9,12 and 17-22.</p>
