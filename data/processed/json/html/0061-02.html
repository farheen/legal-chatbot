The district attorney here did not make a misstatement of the evidence in the case thereby misleading the jury and usurping its function. In <em>Commonwealth v. Toth, </em><a href="/pa/455/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="455 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="582137" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0154-01">455 Pa. 154</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20275" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="314 A.2d 275">314 A.2d 275</a> (1974), the prosecutor misrepresented the hearsay rules and the nature of hearsay testimony to the jury in his closing argument. We found that this misrepresentation warranted a new trial. In the present situation, the district attorney was urging the jury to evaluate the evidence not usurping its ultimate function. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the district attorney was misrepresenting facts in evidence or inferences that could be drawn from them.</p>

In <em>Williams, </em>we held that a warrantless arrest of an individual in his home was legal where the police had probable cause at the time of the arrest and where there were exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances were defined by weighing the following factors: (1) the gravity of the offence; (2) whether the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed; (3) whether there is strong reason to believe the suspect is within the premises being entered; (5) whether there is a likelihood that the suspect will escape if not swiftly apprehended; (6) whether the entry was peaceable; and (7) the time of the entry.</p>

The charges against the defendant in <em>Wagner </em>were dismissed after the court found an illegal arrest However, there, the defendant was convicted of aggravated assault of a police officer.
