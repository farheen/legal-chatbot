In that case, Berardelli, a file clerk with the State Workmen’s Insurance Fund, claimed that she suffered a psychiatric disability because of a tremendous increase in her work load. This Court affirmed the Board, which reversed a referee’s grant of benefits. This Court stated that although Berardelli established that her work load increased and that it caused her injury, she did not establish that the increase was abnormal. In determining whether abnormal working conditions existed, this Court first said that abnormal working conditions can be found after a sudden change or unusual event in the work place. The record in <em>Berardelli </em>supported a finding that her work load had increased gradually, and there was no evidence that such an increase was unusual. This Court next stated that abnormal working conditions can be established by comparing the conditions of the claimant to those of his or her fellow employees performing similar duties. The record in <em>Berardelli </em>did not establish that Berardelli’s working conditions were any different from those of her fellow employees. This Court stated finally that a change of duties accompanied by an increase of responsibility can establish abnormal working conditions, but in <em>Berar-delli </em>the record established that she had no new or additional duties. According to Hershey, the circumstances of <em>Berardelli </em>are the circumstances of the matter <em>sub judice.</em>

Slayton, M.D. (Dr. Slayton), that she suffered a psychiatric injury that can be pinpointed to the events of July 1987 and shortly thereafter. In 1984, Lasher, who had worked for Hershey since 1979, first as a sales representative and then as a district account supervisor, was promoted to be manager of the Pittsburgh district, a district which generated $20,000,000 in sales and which, at that time, employed five persons full time and five persons part time. Lasher called on two accounts herself, and she worked approximately 55 hours a week. The Pittsburgh district extended north to Butler, Pennsylvania, south and west to include the panhandle of West Virginia, and east to include Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. In July 1987, the Pittsburgh district was merged with another, adjoining district (the Parkersburg district) such that the Pittsburgh district extended east to State College, Pennsylvania and about a third of the way into West Virginia, to Elkins, West Virginia. The merged Pittsburgh district generated $31,500,000 in sales and, initially, employed nine persons full time and six persons part time. More importantly, the Par-kersburg district was in poor condition. Lasher testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.6",400,[1045,1688,710,508]]]'>Well, some very poor business decisions had been made in that district prior to my taking it over and there was a lot of ‘cleanup’ work that had to be done, a lot. A lot of old products, thousands and thousands dollars worth of old products that had to be disposed of and warehouses cleaned out, customers that were very dissatisfied with the way Hershey had been treating them, had to be taken care of and we took care of it.</blockquote>

Lasher also testified that she inherited “an empty district.” The one sales representative who had been working in the Parkersburg district was moved to Pittsburgh, leaving three openings for sales representatives in the former Parkersburg district. It was Lasher’s responsibility to hire and train those three new persons. (NT 10, 11). Lasher testified that the merged district was among the ten largest in the country. (NT 11).</p>

Additionally, he testified that Lasher was “a very accomplished district manager” whom Hershey believed could handle the additional responsibilities. Brewer called the merged district a “super district” and agreed that the Parkersburg district had not been properly managed before the merger. (NT 105). Lasher’s performance appraisal for 1987, which was prepared early in 1988 and was signed by Brewer, indicated that she had to expend a lot of extra time and effort because of the merger and that she had to develop new territories. (NT 108, 113). It also stated that Lasher had an extra work load. (NT 108). Brewer also testified that he did not believe that the merged district was ever fully staffed. (NT 109).

She testified that she did not sleep for the entire night before having to call an upset and unruly customer. According to Lasher, this reaction was abnormal for her. (NT 13). Then, in January 1988, she felt fatigued and began to be apprehensive. (NT 13). In March 1988 she felt more fatigued, was not sleeping well, and “just did not feel good.” Also in March 1988, Lasher talked with her supervisor, John Santeford (Santeford), about the merged district being too big. She received no assurance that any changes would be made. (NT 14, 15). Between March and June 6, 1988, her last day of work, Lasher became more apprehensive and nervous. She only slept two or three hours per night, was very sad, and cried. Although she had several additional discussions with Santeford, no changes were made. (NT 16, 17). On June 6, at work, Lasher developed pain in her stomach. Leaving work, she sought medical attention, and one week later was first seen by Dr. Slayton. (NT 18-20). At the time of the referee’s hearing, Lasher was being treated by Dr. Slayton and by Lois Love, Ph.D., a psychologist. (NT 22). At that time, she was taking Lithium, Librium, and Halcion.

At the time of his deposition, she “continued to have symptoms of ruminating and worrying about her job and sighing a lot, feeling that she just couldn’t concentrate, still worrying about everything.” (Dep. 12). In addition to taking medication, Lasher had submitted to a course of electroshock therapy. Although her mood improved briefly, she quickly relapsed. Dr. Slayton stated that she was “back to her original baseline in terms of treatment.” (Dep. 18,19). According to Dr. Slayton, Lasher’s work situation caused her depression. He stated that she was conscientious and very dedicated to Hershey and that she was “subjected ... to a great amount of psychologic stress,” when she was placed into “a situation where she essentially [had] no escape mechanism short of essentially abandoning some of her responsibilities, letting whatever would happen after-wards happen.” (Dep. 26). He opined that neither her family nor her social history caused the depression and that she was unable to return to her job because of the intensity of her symptoms. (Dep. 26, 27). On cross examination, Dr. Slayton testified that events in Lasher’s personal life, including the death of her father and of a close <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>friend, did not cause her depression. He testified that it was “the work environment predominantly and overwhelmingly that led her into her current clinical situation.” (Dep. 43, 44). Dr. Slayton’s prognosis for Lasher was guarded.

There was a significant additional workload placed on Lasher suddenly; Brewer testified that “what she had on Friday vs. what she had on Monday, yes, there would be [an additional workload].” (NT 107). This event, which required Lash-er to devote significantly more time and effort to transform a poorly managed and neglected district into one that functioned well proved to be more than Lasher, a well respected manager for Hershey, could handle. Although both Dr. Slayton and Hershey’s psychiatrist testified that Lasher is obsessive and workaholic, we believe that substantial evidence of record supports the Board’s and the referee’s conclusion that Lasher’s disability was caused by other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions.
