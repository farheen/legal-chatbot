In reviewing a lower court decision granting a motion for a directed verdict this court is bound by the same standards that govern the trial justice. The evidence must be reviewed in the light most favorable for the nonmoving party without consideration of the weight of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses. If there is evidence that supports the nonmoving party or upon which reasonable minds could differ, the motion should be denied. <em>Margodonna v.

Accordingly the appeal of the plaintiff is denied and dismissed.</p>
