    <p id="AC6" data-blocks='[["BL_125.9",125,[155,1042,754,611]]]'>Stephen G. Camperson was tried by jury and was found guilty of two counts each of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver and criminal conspiracy. Post-trial motions were denied, and Camperson was sentenced to serve concurrent terms of imprisonment for not less than four years nor more than ten years and for not less than eight years nor more than sixteen years on his two convictions of possession with intent to deliver. On direct appeal from the judgments of sentence, Camperson raises several issues, which we will review carefully.</p>
    <p id="AdPc" data-blocks='[["BL_125.10",125,[155,1679,754,754]]]'>The facts of this case are somewhat complicated and have a substantial effect on several of the issues which we have been asked to review. On November 29, 1989, Donald Theisan called Brian Wynn by telephone and asked Wynn if he had methamphetamine for sale. Wynn contacted Stephen Camperson, and Camperson agreed to furnish Wynn with the drug. On December 1, 1989, in Chester County, Camperson gave Wynn approximately an ounce of methamphetamine which Wynn, in turn, sold to Theisan in the company of John Murray, an undercover police officer, in Montgomery County. Wynn delivered the proceeds of the sale to Camperson later the same night.</p>

Wynn obtained the methamphetamine from Camperson at or about midnight on December 5, 1989, and sold it to Theisan and Murray in Plymouth Meeting, Montgomery County, on December 6, 1989. Wynn was placed under arrest and subsequently agreed to assist police in prosecuting Camperson. Wynn was released on his own recognizance and taken home.</p>
    <p id="An0" data-blocks='[["BL_125.13",125,[954,531,772,899]]]'>On December 7, 1989, Wynn met with Camperson, under police surveillance, and paid him $3,500 for the methamphetamine which Camperson had furnished on December 5. Pursuant to instructions from the police, Wynn placed a further order for a half pound of methamphetamine, and he and Camperson agreed to meet later the same day at the Country Tavern, near Pottstown, in Chester County. Camperson then returned to his residence, still under police surveillance. Several hours later, as Camp-erson neared the Country Tavern, he became aware of the presence of police and attempted to flee. A lengthy chase ensued, following which Camperson was apprehended. On his person were 238.8 grams of methamphetamine and the $3,500 which he had received?! from Wynn earlier in the day.</p>
    <p id="A1L" data-blocks='[["BL_125.14",125,[954,1460,757,563]]]'>Following Camperson’s arrest, police obtained a search warrant and searched his residence in St. Peter’s Village, Warwick Township, Chester County. There police found additional drugs and drug paraphernalia. Camperson was subsequently tried for various offenses in Chester County. In Montgomery County, Camperson was tried by jury and was found guilty of being an accomplice in the several sales of methamphetamine made by Wynn to Theisan and John Murray in Montgomery County.</p>

When court convened, Camperson’s lawyer moved for a mistrial because of the newspaper story. The trial court questioned the jurors, three of whom acknowledged having seen the article. These three jurors were <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>then questioned individually, out of the hearing of the remaining members of the panel. Two said they had read the article; the third juror had not read the article but had stopped as soon as he realized it pertained to the case then on trial before the jury of which he was a part. Although all three jurors insisted that they could nevertheless decide the ease fairly on the evidence which they would hear in the courtroom, the trial court excused the two who had read the article and replaced them with alternate jurors. On appeal, Camperson argues that the court erred when it refused to grant a mistrial.</p>

The defense contended that, in fact, it had been Wynn who was the major drug supplier and that it had been Wynn who rented the house in St. Peter’s Village for use as a drug distribution center. Appellant, it was suggested, had lived at this residence only because he had been unable to obtain a place to live on his own. To this end, the defense introduced evidence that Wynn had been the named lessee for the premises; and a defense witness testified that Wynn had sold or given him marijuana on numerous occasions and that he had personally observed Wynn selling both marijuana and methamphetamine on several occasions. This evidence was intended to show, according to appellant, that there had been no agreement between him and Wynn for Wynn to sell methamphetamine on December 1 and 6,1989. Any scheme to distribute methamphetamine, it was contended, had been by Wynn and did not include appellant.</p>

It was later on the same day that appellant had been stopped by police officers while en route to the pre-arranged meeting place. Appellant had then had in his possession the half pound of methamphetamine which he had agreed to provide to Wynn. He had also had in his possession the $3500 which Wynn had allegedly given him as the proceeds of the sale which had taken place on December 6, 1989. When police had attempted to stop him, appellant fled. Later, when they had searched the home occupied by appellant, police discovered additional methamphetamine and equipment used to process methamphetamine. All of this evidence tended to refute appellant’s defense and identify appellant as the supplier of methamphetamine to Wynn on December 1 and 6, 1989. It also tended to demonstrate an intent on the part of appellant to distribute methamphetamine. The trial court did not err when it allowed this evidence to be introduced. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
