    </p>
    <p id="b633-7" data-blocks='[["BL_633.7",633,[130,814,1125,441]]]'>At trial, the twelve-year-old victim testified that in late November 1990, she went to her friend’s home to “drink, smoke, and watch porno movies,” as generally permitted by her friend’s father, appellant Michael Patterson. On this first occasion, the victim became heavily intoxicated and passed out behind a couch with a blanket over her. She testified that when she awoke, the blanket was off, her pants and panties had been removed, and Patterson was lying on top of her, trying to have intercourse. She successfully resisted his efforts by squirming away and rolling over.</p>
    <p id="b633-8" data-blocks='[["BL_633.8",633,[134,1270,1123,259]]]'>The victim testified that a few weeks later, she again became heavily intoxicated at Patterson’s house and fell asleep. She awoke to find Patterson with his hands inside her shirt, fondling her breasts. The victim rolled over to avoid further touching. She claims that on both these occasions, she was so affected by the alcohol that she was unsure the sexual activities had occurred.</p>
    <p id="b633-9" data-blocks='[["BL_633.9",633,[134,1545,1127,492]]]'>On a third occasion, Patterson took his daughter and the victim to the store to purchase alcohol for them. Both girls chose a drink, but the victim testified that she became ill that evening and did not drink. Instead, she went to Patterson’s daughter’s bedroom and fell asleep. Continuing with her testimony, the victim stated that later that night, she awoke to find Patterson rubbing her vaginal area through her jeans. She testified that he also attempted to unbutton her pants and place his hand inside, but when she rolled over, Patterson left the room. Because the victim was sober during this third incident, she maintained that her hazy recollection of the two prior molestations was confirmed.</p>
    <p id="b633-10" data-blocks='[["BL_633.10",633,[138,2043,1125,313]],["BL_634.1",634,[361,298,1119,132]]]'>The victim told Patterson’s daughter and then a second friend of the incidents. This second friend told her mother, Ms. Zamarippa, who invited Patterson to meet with the victim in hér presence in order to discuss the allegations. Zamarippa testified that Patterson denied the touchings when accused, but later, outside the presence of the victim, admitted that “when he drinks that sometimes he blacks out so there was maybe a possibility he <a id="p1528" href="#p1528" data-label="1528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1528</a>could have done it.” This meeting between the threesome resulted in the victim arranging to meet with Patterson’s psychologist to discuss the allegations.</p>
    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[361,435,1121,221]]]'>The police were not advised of Patterson’s behavior until May 1991, when the victim called the sheriff’s office to report the incidents. On the same day, an investigator from that office interviewed the victim, who noted all of the details she could remember concerning the three incidents.</p>

Zamarippa and the psychologist only briefly stated what the victim had told them regarding the alleged incidents. However, during the investigator’s direct examination, he presented a summary of each of the three incidents as told to him in his initial interview with the victim. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the investigator about the victim’s statements to him about drinking heavily the night prior to the second incident. The apparent purpose of this questioning was to create doubt as to the victim’s ability to recall the events surrounding that evening’s incident. On redirect examination, the investigator was asked to give a detailed account of the second incident as told to him in the same initial interview. Defense counsel interposed no objection to the admission of these prior consistent statements.</p>

In other words, as an adult, Patterson was providing a stage for the very actions attributed to him by the victim. Moreover, and significantly, Ms. Zamarippa testified that Patterson admitted to her that “when he drinks that sometimes he blacks out so there was maybe a possibility he could have done it.” Such an admission is particularly damning considering the nature and required consciousness of the alleged offenses. To conclude that such conduct could have occurred while Patterson was “blacked out” stretches credulity to the breaking point.
