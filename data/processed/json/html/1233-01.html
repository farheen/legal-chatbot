The claimant credibly testified about his pre-existing heart condition and the meeting he had with Mr. Egan on February 5, 1997. This meeting was to discuss attendance policies and some of the claimant’s prior absences. The claimant credibly testified that during this meeting he began to experience chest pains and difficulties.</blockquote>

The claimant is also found credible where he testified that he was not aware that the heart attack might be connected to work until he read a workers’ compensation handbook in July of 1997. He credibly testified that at that point he probably contacted the workers’ compensation carrier in addition to contacting [Eugene] Egan to fill out an employer’s report of accident. His going to Mr. Egan in August of 1997 was corroborated by Mr. Egan’s testimony in that regard, as discussed above.</blockquote>

The testimony of [Eugene] Egan is found credible where it corroborates the testimony of the claimant. This witness testified credibly that there was a meeting on February 5, 1997, and that the claimant got upset at that meeting. The witness also credibly testified that he was made aware approximately 30 minutes afterwards that the claimant had to be taken to the hospital. The witness credibly testified that the claimant did not go to him until August of 1997 to fill out an accident report for a heart attack which occurred in February of 1997. The witness also credibly testified that he was not aware, nor was he made aware by anyone, at any time prior to August of 1997, that the claimant had a heart attack. This corroborates the claimant’s own testimony that he was not aware of a possible connection between the work event and the heart attack until he read a blue workers’ compensation handbook in July of 1997.</blockquote>

Dr. Osmanski, the treating doctor, testified about the claimant’s past relevant heart condition and the fact that he suffered a heart attack at the time of this meeting with Mr. Egan on February 5, 1997. The independent medical evaluator, Dr. Garrett, is also found credible where he corroborates Dr. Osmanski. The independent medical evaluator credibly reports that the claimant did in fact suffer a heart attack in February of 1997 based on the history he received, his examination and records reviewed. Although he wanted to review additional records around the time of the heart attack, these apparently were never provided and a supplemental report was never provided from this doctor in this regard.</blockquote>

This adjudicator finds that notice was properly given to defendant by the claimant in this case. The Act provides that a claimant must notify employer within 120 days from the date he knows or by reasonable diligence should know of the possible connection between an injury and work. The claimant clearly and unequivocally testified that he was not aware of such a possible connection until he read the workers’ compensation handbook in July of 1997. He responded to these questions from both the claimant’s counsel, defense counsel and this adjudicator at the initial hearing. Furthermore, the testimony of the de<a id="p1236" href="#p1236" data-label="1236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1236</a>fendant’s own witness, [Eugene] Egan, corroborates the claimant’s testimony in this regard. Specifically, Mr. Egan testified that the claimant never approached him about a work-related heart attack until he went to him in August of 1997, to fill out an accident report. Therefore, it is found that notice was properly given to the defendant by the claimant in this case.</blockquote>

The claimant credibly testified and both his doctor and the independent medical evaluator have confirmed the heart attack in February of 1997. Mr. Egan’s testimony corroborates that there was a heated exchange and that the claimant became upset at this meeting. No documentation, testimony or other evidence has been offered by the defendant to rebut the claimant’s assertions or the medical evidence offered to establish a work-related heart attack which occurred in February of 1997. Counsel fees for unreasonable contest are therefore appropriate and shall be awarded.</blockquote>

Upon review, the Board determined that the WCJ did not err in finding that Claimant suffered a work-related heart attack and that Claimant gave notice to Employer within 120 days of the time he knew or should have known that the heart attack could be work related. The Board determined further that the WCJ did err in granting Claimant’s request for attorney fees for an unreasonable contest. The Board opined that because Employer became aware through Mr. Egan of Claimant’s claim that his heart attack was work-related more than 120 days after the event, the legal question of notice needed to be resolved. Thus, the Board concluded that Employer had a reasonable basis to contest Claimant’s claim petition. Accordingly, by order of October 11, 2000, the Board reversed the portion of the WCJ’s decision and order awarding attorney fees based on an unreasonable contest and affirmed the WCJ’s order and decision in all other respects.

If the claimant was alleging an injury where a psychological stimulus caused a psychic injury otherwise known as a mental/mental injury, the claimant’s burden was twofold: (1) the claimant must prove by objective evidence that he suffered a psychic injury; and (2) that such injury is other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions. <em>See Martin v. Ketchum, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/523/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="523 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1820306" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0509-01">523 Pa. 509</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="523 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1820306" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0509-01">568 A.2d 159</a> (1990). Even if the claimant showed actual, not merely perceived or imagined, employment events that have precipitated the psychic injury, the claimant must still prove the events to be abnormal in order to recover. <em>Wilson v.

Accordingly, when a claimant is alleging a mental/physical injury, the claimant must now prove, in addition to proving that a psychological stimulus caused the injury, that the psychological stimulus is other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions. In other words, the claimant must prove that the psychological stimulus was caused by abnormal working conditions.</p>

However, because this prong of Claimant’s burden was not addressed by the WCJ, there are no specific findings in this regard. Moreover, the Board failed to consider the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Davis </em>in disposing of Employer’s appeal. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the Board’s order affirming the WCJ’s granting of Claimant’s claim petition and remand to the Board for further remand to the WCJ for findings in accordance with Claimant’s burden of proof as set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>Davis.</em>
