On January 18, 2005, Detective Harry Young of the Philadelphia Police Department was asked to speak to two adult brothers regarding <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>their allegations of sexual abuse by Appel-lee, which occurred some twenty years previously. After obtaining statements from the men, Detective Young advised them he believed that prosecution was not possible, because the statute of limitations period had passed, but stated that he would give the information to the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office and would speak with police in Florida, where the Appellee resided.</p>

At Detective Lumpkin’s request, on May 4, 2005, Detective Young faxed Detective Lumpkin copies of the statements taken on January 18, 2005. Detective Young also informed Detective Lumpkin that, based on information received from the Philadelphia assistant district attorney assigned to the case, he did not believe that the Commonwealth would be able to prosecute Appellee because the statute of limitations period had passed.</p>

At that time, both Detective Lumpkin and Sergeant Breiske were not in uniform and drove an unmarked car; however, they did carry their weapons. The detectives interviewed Appellee in his living room. They informed Appellee that two men had accused him of molesting them and read him portions of one of the men’s statement.

At the onset of the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth stated that the suppression issue should be assessed under Florida law, and the trial court agreed. N.T. 1/30/08 at 60. However, it appears that the parties and the trial court used Pennsylvania law at the hearing. Further, the parties cite only to Pennsylvania case law on appeal.

However, although it is not mandated where more than one state has a substantial connection with the activity in question, the forum state may analyze the interests of all states involved and choose which state’s law to apply. In Pennsylvania, we do not apply our law just because we have jurisdiction. Rather we have adopted a flexible choice of law rule which weighs the interests our sister-states may have in the transaction .... To start this analysis we first note that procedural rules and substantive law require separate considerations. It is a fundamental principle of conflicts of laws that a court will use the procedural rules of its own state. That is true in both civil and criminal cases, but especially in criminal cases as a sort of corollary to the local nature of substantive criminal law. Procedures in criminal cases are always those of the forum. On the other hand, substantive law gives or defines the right.</blockquote>
