King, was temporarily disabled by acute back pain, which he suffered while working as an electrician at a job site in the District of Columbia. He filed a claim for benefits under the District of Columbia Workers’ Compensation Act of 1979, as amended, D.C.Code §§ 36-301 <em>et seq. </em>(1997) (hereinafter, the “Act” or the “WCA”). His claim was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that his employment was not “principally localized” in the District.</p>

We are asked to decide how that statute applies to a case of cumulative traumatic injury arising out of employment that is carried on both inside and outside the District of Columbia. The answer to that question depends on how the “time of injury” is fixed in a cumulative trauma case. We do not decide that legal question, however, because we find that respondent District of Columbia Department of Employment Services failed to make findings of material fact, while misapprehending and fading to construe the applicable law. We are therefore constrained to reverse the dismissal of King’s claim and to remand for further proceedings. On remand, the Department needs to make a clear finding as to whether King’s disability was in fact caused by his employment. If the Department does find that King sustained a job-related, cumulative traumatic injury to his back, then it must construe § 36-303 in order to articulate the rule under that statute for fixing the “time of injury” in cumulative trauma cases. The Depart<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>ment must then apply that rule to the facts of King’s case in order to determine whether his injury is covered by the WCA.</p>

    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[141,497,754,534]]]'>Petitioner King began working for inter-venor Moonlighting Electric Company (“Moonlighting”) in July 1986 as a foreman and service electrician. King was hired in Maryland, where Moonlighting is headquartered; and he resided in that state at the time of the hearing. Most of King’s jobs as an employee of Moonlighting were in Maryland, but he also worked from time to time at sites in other jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.6",509,[142,1054,751,634]]]'>On April 11, 1994, King was performing work on the second day of a job in the District of Columbia when he experienced back pain severe enough that he had to stop working. He did not return to work until August 31, 1994. King subsequently filed a claim under the WCA for temporary total disability benefits from April 11 through August 31, 1994, as well as for medical expenses. Moonlighting and its insurer, intervenor ITT Hartford, contested this claim. A hearing was held on April 12,1996.</p>

The examiner found that the electrician position that King held with Moonlighting for some eight years did involve a degree of physical exertion, requiring King to lift at least sixty pounds, bend, climb ladders, carry material, stoop, crawl, and get into awkward positions. King testified that he first experienced back pain on the job in December 1993 while working in an electrical closet and that his symptoms progressively worsened over the next few months. He also testified that in the early 1980s he had seen a doctor for back pain, which medical records indicated was related to a tennis injury, and again in 1992 for back pain that lasted a couple of weeks. In his decision, the hearing examiner noted that King “first sought treatment for back pain in 1984,” approximately two years before he commenced his employment with Moonlighting. One of King’s treating physicians classified King’s problem as a degenerative disk disease with bulging disks that might at some future date require surgical intervention.</p>
    <p id="b509-11" data-blocks='[["BL_509.11",509,[939,1081,756,935]]]'>King claimed that on April 11, 1994, when his back pain made it impossible for him to continue working, he sustained an accidental, work-related injury which aggravated his preexisting back condition. He based this claim on his testimony that “I was working, and the pain and irritation of lifting cable and stuff finally just had got to be too much for me to take.” King offered no further evidence as to what (if any) activity or event on April 11 triggered the increased back pain that he experienced, or as to the nature of the work he was performing when he became disabled. In the absence of such evidence, King relied upon the presumption embodied in D.C.Code § 36-321(1) of a causal connection between his disability and a work-related event.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

They argued that the medical evidence showed that King had back problems that pre-dated his employment, <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>and that he became disabled simply because his back condition degenerated naturally to the point where he was no longer able to work.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[189,473,754,731]]]'>In his decision denying King’s claim, the hearing examiner made no finding as to whether King’s back injury and disability were, in fact, work-related, either because King sustained an aggravating injury on April 11 or because over time the physical exertion of his job subjected his back to cumulative trauma and consequent gradual injury. The examiner likewise made no finding as to <em>the time </em>of any work-related back injury that King may have sustained. Nor did the examiner make a finding as to <em>when, </em>if ever, King knew or should have known that his back pain was related to his work.</p>

Ignoring King’s claim that he suffered an aggravating injury on April 11, and assuming (without deciding) that King’s disability resulted from a “cumulative trauma,” the examiner said that there was “no definitive date of injury which would bring this matter within the ambit” of the coverage provisions of D.C.Code § 36-303(a). The examiner did not explain how he arrived at this conclusion, but he apparently considered § 36-303(a) to be inapplicable because it provides that coverage partially depends on the time of the injury and whether the injury occurred inside or outside the District of Columbia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Under former § 36-303(a), an injury was covered by the WCA only if, “at the time” of the injury, the employment was “principally localized in the District of Columbia,” regardless of whether the injury occurred inside or outside the District.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Applying the three-prong Hughes<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> test, the examiner found that “the geographical contacts between claimant’s employment relationship and the state of Maryland are more substantial, qualitatively and quantitatively, than those same contacts between claimant’s employment relationship and any other jurisdiction.” Accordingly, the examiner concluded that King was excluded from the coverage of the Act, inasmuch as his em<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>ployment was not principally localized in the District of Columbia.</p>

Specifically, Claimant testified that his back pain began in December of 1993 but did not become disabling until April 11, 1994. This in the Director’s opinion, and as correctly concluded by the Hearing Examiner, would make Claimant’s injury a cumulative one in which there is no definitive date of injury. There being no definitive date of injury, the 1991 amendment to the Act would not [be] applicable in this matter. Therefore, the Hearing Examiner was correct in utilizing preexisting legislation as well as the interpretation established in the <em>Hughes </em>case in order to determine whether jurisdiction was conferred upon Claimant’s injury.</blockquote>

King argues that, for purposes of that statute, the hearing examiner and the Director should have ruled that he sustained his injury while at work in the District of Columbia, and therefore that his claim was covered by the WCA pursuant to subsection (a)(1). (King does not contend that his employment was principally localized within the District; rather, he contends that the locus of his employment was immaterial given that his injury occurred when he was in the District.) Moonlighting and ITT Hartford, on the other hand, ask us to affirm the denial of King’s claim on the grounds that (1) King was not injured on April 11, and (2) medical testimony established that his disability was attributable to a natural progression of his longstanding back ailments that was unrelated to his employment.</p>

Nor, indeed, did resort to the pre-1991 law in lieu of current law obviate the need to fix a time of injury in order to determine coverage. By its express terms the former § 36-303(a) tied coverage to the principal locus of employment “at the time of ... injury,” see <em>supra </em>note 3, much as the current statute focuses on the time of injury.</p>

If so, that rationale overlooks the fact that under D.C.Code § 36-303(a), the question of coverage cannot be resolved without first determining the time (and place) of injury. It is necessary to make that determination in order to decide whether subsection (a)(1) or subsection (a)(2) governs coverage. (Moreover, if subsection (a)(2) governs coverage, it is also necessary to determine the time of injury for purposes of applying the “principally localized” test.) To say that the time of a cumulative trauma injury is “indefinite” does not automatically settle which subsection of § 36-303(a) governs coverage for such an injury where the employee suffered some of the trauma, and became disabled, while working in the District. Without having a rule for fixing the time of injury in such a case, we see no reason — and the hearing examiner and the Director offered none — why subsection (a)(2) rather than (a)(1) would necessarily apply to such a case.</p>

If so, then King’s claim was potentially covered because cumulative traumat-. ic injuries are compensable under the WCA. In that event, to determine whether King’s claim was in fact covered, the hearing examiner would have had to construe § 36-303(a) and articulate the rule for determining time of injury in a cumulative trauma case. Once the examiner answered that question, he would have had to apply the rule to the facts of this case to determine when (and where) King was injured and whether subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of § 36-303 governs coverage.</p>

Some workers whose injuries did not become manifest until after the WCA took effect might be deprived of coverage entirely if the principal locus of their employment was outside the District at that time. To avoid a total loss of coverage, the court held that in such cases, if coverage would also be unavailable under any other state statute, the LHWCA would continue to apply. <em>Railco, </em><a href="/a2d/564/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="564 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="11358904" data-case-paths="/a2d/564/1167-01">564 A.2d at 1176</a>.</p>

Neither <em>Franklin </em>nor <em>Railco </em>addressed that specific question. Both cases preceded the 1991 amendment of § 36-303(a), and hence did not purport to construe the precise statutory language now before us. Moreover, the court did not explain in <em>Railco </em>why its formulation of the manifestation rule differed from the agency’s formulation in <em>Franklin. </em>Indeed, the court took no notice of the difference. For these reasons alone we would hesitate to treat <em>Franklin </em>or <em>Railco </em>as having decided the time of injury issue that is presented in the case now before us. Moreover, the issue addressed in <em>Railco </em>was a narrow one. <em>Railco </em>answered the specific question of which statute should apply where the claimant was last exposed to the harm that caused his occupational disease prior to the effective date of a new statute but the disease was not manifest until after that statute went into effect. In choosing a manifestation rule to answer that question, the court did not necessarily consider all the implications of such a rule in other factual contexts. We are not convinced, for example, that <em>Railco </em>necessarily would foreclose coverage under the WCA where the disease was manifest pri- or to the effective date of that Act but the last exposure occurred <em>after </em>that date. D.C.Code § 36-310 specifically provides that in the case of occupational diseases, “liability for compensation rests with the employer of the last known exposure.” This statutory provision would seem to imply that where the last exposure to a harmful working condition occurred after the effective date of the Act, the occupational disease should be covered by the Act even if that disease began manifesting itself before the Act took effect.</p>

The "time of injury” question is similar to the question of when the time begins to run for an injured employee to give notice or file a claim. The WCA addresses this latter question by explicitly adopting a "discovery” rule in D.C.Code §§ 36-313 and -314. Those sections provide that the time for giving notice or filing a claim does not begin to run until the employee is aware, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware, of a relationship between the injury and the employment. This discovery rule is a form of "manifestation" rule. This court has addressed the operation of the discovery rule under §§ 36-313 and -314 in cases involving cumulative trauma injuries, <em>see Jimenez v. District of Columbia Dep’t of Employment Servs., </em><a href="/a2d/701/0837-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="701 A.2d 837" data-case-ids="11901954" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0837-01">701 A.2d 837</a> (D.C.1997), and <em>KOH Sys. v.
