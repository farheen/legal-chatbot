While ordinarily this could be a problem, in this case, given the trial court’s ruling that it would not give an instruction or declare a mistrial at the time, counsel had the right to attempt to rehabilitate appellant.

We noted that the high probability of jury confusion in the prior inconsistent statement cases was not present in the case of prior convictions evidence used for impeachment. "We are not persuaded that juries which are properly instructed at the conclusion of trial will generally misapprehend in the absence of an immediate cautionary instruction during trial the limited purpose of the prior conviction evidence.” <a href="/a2d/287/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="287 A.2d 89" data-case-ids="8058672" data-case-paths="/a2d/287/0089-01">287 A.2d at 99</a>. <em>Cf.

To reemphasize what we have already noted, we believe that in the majority of cases, an instruction given as part of final instructions would be sufficient to avoid jury misuse of improperly admitted evidence or of evidence admitted for a limited purpose. However, to avoid unnecessary issues that may possibly require a new trial, trial judges may well choose to give immediate instructions in such cases where requested by defense counsel.</p>
