On that date, San-tone was sentenced to concurrent terms of one to two years in a state prison for failure to pay employee withholding tax. As to all other charges, Santone was sentenced to one year of probation. Additionally, Santone was ordered to make restitution to the Department of Revenue in the amount of $304,108.90, fined $200.00 and ordered to pay the costs of prosecution.</p>

William J. Fulton, Esquire, then replaced McGowan as counsel. Fulton filed a supplemental motion to modify sentence on May 13, 1999 and the Commonwealth filed an answer. A hearing on the motion was set for June 1, 1999. On May 26,1999, the hearing was rescheduled for June 30, 1999. The court then granted a continuance until September 20,1999.</p>

The docket reflects that counsel for Santone filed a timely motion to modify sentence on April 22, 1999; therefore, the 120-day period to decide the motion to modify sentence expired on August 20, 1999. A motion for extension of time was not filed. Even assuming that one thirty day extension had been requested and granted, the motion would have been deemed denied by operation of law on September 20, 1999.

The <em>Braykovich </em>court held that the defendant’s failure to timely file a notice of appeal from the judgment of sentence was caused by “a breakdown in the processes of the court, that is, the clerk of court’s failure to notify him that his motion had been denied by operation of law.” <em>Id. </em>at 137.
