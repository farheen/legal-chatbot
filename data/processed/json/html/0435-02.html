Gainer testified that he was in the Philadelphia Detention Center on October 2, 1988, and while there, saw and conversed with Appellant. N.T. 1/6/88, 28-30. During the course of that meeting, Gainer testified that Appellant admitted killing Jamie Lamb because he thought that Lamb had killed his cousin. N.T. 1/6/88, 31. Appellant argues that the jury knew that his incarceration at the Philadelphia Detention Center was for criminal conduct other than that for which he was on trial. However, our review of the record does not support the assertion that the jury was able to conclude that Appellant’s presence in the Philadelphia Detention on October 2, 1983, was the result of a separate, unrelated criminal act.</p>
