Blake claims that a hostile work environment was created by Johnson, who was her immediate supervisor, and who was acting in that capacity.

A supervisor must be able to exert authority when interacting with a subordinate. In order to demonstrate a hostile work environment in the case of a supervisor-subordinate, the subordinate must show that the hostility was severe or pervasive, and that it extended beyond the normal tension that exists in many supervisor-supervisee relationships. <em>See e.g., Nadeau, </em><a href="/a2d/675/0973-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="675 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="7868134" data-case-paths="/a2d/675/0973-01">675 A.2d at 976</a> (holding that supervisor’s offering money in exchange for sexual acts was sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment); <em>Bowen v.
