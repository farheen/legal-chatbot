The wages claimed by Meyer in the civil suit consist of commissions, settlement service fees, auto lease expenses and administrative fees. The claimed administrative fees represent a standard and customary 10% fee in the real estate industry for completing work on settlements left uncompleted by another individual who left her employ with GDG. The settlement service fees purportedly represent Meyer’s agreed-upon shares of forfeited deposits from buyers who reneged on sales agreements procured by Meyer. GDG asserted a counterclaim against Meyer because it experienced significant decline in gross sales revenue during January 1987 to August 1988.</p>

Petitioners essentially contend that the department’s decision is purely arbitrary, not in accordance with the law and is not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners argue that the department imposed fluctuating and conflicting burdens of proof.</p>
    <p id="b429-8" data-blocks='[["BL_429.8",429,[181,1987,751,514]]]'>In its final October 27, 1994 decision, the department stated that the burden of the employer is to demonstrate the absence of any necessity for bond or security based on its financial position and ability to satisfy the judgment requested by Meyer. We note that the department had previously set forth this same burden in its interlocutory decision of March 24, 1993, granting in part and denying in part petitioners’ motion limiting the scope of the bond hearings.</p>
    <p id="b429-9" data-blocks='[["BL_429.9",429,[183,2523,747,228]],["BL_429.10",429,[985,247,745,278]]]'>The fact that the department used such language as “I am not entirely convinced”, “I am not satisfied”, and “I am also concerned” does not indicate that the department changed burdens or imposed a different standard than previously set forth. When the department’s decision is reviewed as a whole, it is clear that the department did not impose new, fluctuating or conflicting burdens upon petitioners by using such terms in its decision.</p>
    <p id="b429-12" data-blocks='[["BL_429.11",429,[981,572,752,1015]]]'>In determining whether the evidence demonstrated the absence of any necessity for bond based on GDG’s financial position and its ability to satisfy the judgment, the department pointed out that GDG’s latest annual financial report showed cash assets of $369 and that one third of its stock sold for only $7,500. With regard to the future income of GDG, the department noted that the three parcels owned by GDG were not actively offered for sale and that the income from the eventual sales may not be paid to GDG, but instead to Gwynedd II. Further, two of the parcels were being used by developers. The department believed that the independence incentive for GDG to insist on constructing a home on the one vacant parcel and to demand payment for the sales proceeds from the three parcels was lacking. We cannot conclude that such reasoning was a manifest abuse of the department’s discretion.</p>
    <p id="b429-13" data-blocks='[["BL_429.12",429,[978,1628,751,380]]]'>Petitioners contend that the department should have considered the financial position of GVA. However, the department’s refusal to do so was not an abuse of discretion based on the fact that Meyer had not requested judgment against this company in his WPCL count and that he did not allege that he was an employee of GVA.</p>
    <p id="b429-14" data-blocks='[["BL_429.13",429,[979,2047,750,526]]]'>When considering the absence of the necessity for the individual defendants to post a bond, the department found no showing of financial ability by McNichol. It is clear from the record that McNichol had no money and the burden was on McNichol to show the absence of the necessity for a bond and his financial ability to satisfy the requested judgment. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the department to require McNichol to post the bond.</p>

Mignatti<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> were financially able to satisfy the requested judgment and that there was an absence for the necessity of a bond from these individuals. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[240,459,752,705]]]'>The department reviewed the assets of each of these defendants and found that the availability of those assets was questionable. Based on the financial statements, this determination was well within the department’s discretion. The department pointed out that large portions of the assets consisted of unlisted securities and holdings in family businesses and that certain of the assets, including liquid assets, were jointly owned with their spouses. This caused the department concern that Meyer would not be able to promptly collect any compensation that may be due to him by petitioners in keeping with the purpose of the WPCL.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[240,1204,751,556]]]'>We remind petitioners that this court cannot overturn an agency’s exercise of its discretion in the absence of bad faith, fraud, capricious action or abuse of power. As the petitioners’ burden was to prove the absence of the necessity for a bond based on their financial positions and the ability to satisfy the requested judgment, we hold that the department did not abuse its discretion in issuing a notice to petitioners to post a bond or security in the amount of $130,-417.70.</p>
