Kibben, was on October 16, 1925, the owner of the property therein described, and that she made and delivered the contract a copy of which is attached to the bill and made a part thereof, whereby Maude C. Kibben (not being joined by her husband) agreed to sell ,and the defendants agreed to purchase for a named consideration certain real estate. The contract acknowledged receipt of an initial payment and obligated <a id="p1686" href="#p1686" data-label="1686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1686</a>the purchasers to pay $500.00 on January 1, 1926, and “balance in one, two, three and four years from date” of instrument, and “mortgage to be given when deed is delivered (January 1, 1926).” The bill shows further the receipt of the initial payment as well as the sum of $500.00 which was to have been paid on January 1, 1926; a tender of a warranty deed to said property duly executed by complainants together with abstract showing merchantable title to the property; and offer to perform all acts required to be done by complainant Maude C. Kibben; a failure and refusal of defendant to perform the agreement; and a present readiness and willingness and ability of complainants to perform the contract. It is alleged also that the defendants have had continuous possession of the premises from the date of the contract, the value of which to the time of the filing of the amended bill was alleged to be $3,250.00. The bill contains a prayer that the defendants be required to pay the amount ascertained to be due by the court, that such amount be decreed to be a lien upon the property, that the premises be sold to satisfy said lien, that a deficiency decree be entered and also prays for general relief. A demurrer was interposed to the bill and the same was overruled by the court. The defendants thereupon appealed the ease to this Court.</p>

      <a id="p1687" href="#p1687" data-label="1687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1687</a>Appellants in their brief contend that there is no mutuality in the contract sought to be enforced, because the vendor at the time of making the contract was a married woman and her husband did not join her in its execution. It appears however, that both husband and wife joined in the execution of the deed which was tendered to the defendants and that the complainants offered to perform every act on their part that was required by the contract. The demurrer admits that the defendants not only refused to comply with the terms of the agreement to be performed by them, but that they retained possession of the property. There is no question here of the vendor failing or refusing to live up to the contract. Under these circumstances, is it to be said that merely because the vendor was a married woman, she can have no relief in equity She could not refuse to fail to. comply with the provisions of the contract and at the same time retain the money paid in pursuance of its terms, for a court of equity would decree that she “return the money paid to her, and failing therein, that it become a lien upon her separate property.” Wheeler v.

Where a contract - for the sale of land is in the form of a bond for title given by the vendor, conditioned on the performance of the vendee’s promises, a court of equity may upon a breach of the contract by the vendee foreclose his rights thereunder, and in granting appropriate relief, may, at the instance of the vendor, who re<a id="p1689" href="#p1689" data-label="1689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1689</a>tained title, order a sale of the property, where it will not be inequitable to the vendee in possession. Where, under a contract for the sale of real estate, the vendee is given possession as a purchaser, and after making part payments of the purchase price he fails to complete the contract as expressly stipulated, the vendee may have an equitable right to require a conveyance of the title, upon compliance with his part of the contract and upon doing equity, within a reasonable time during or after the expiration of the contract period, where under the contract time is not equitably essential. And upon the default of the vendee the vendor has the correlative right to an equitable enforcement .of the contract by requiring the payment of the consideration within a reasonable time, or in default thereof to have the lights of the vendee under the contract foreclosed. In these cases the court will make such a decree as the particular allegations and proofs may warrant. Even though the specific relief prayed may be found to be inequitable or impracticable, where there is a prayer for general relief, and appropriate relief thereunder may be equitably granted consistently with the allegations and the specific relief prayed, a demurrer to the bill of complaint is properly overruled. ’ ’</blockquote>
