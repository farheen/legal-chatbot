That slight difference in the two regulations does not mean that judicial review is barred in the “without apparent merit” grievance. Resolution “without apparent merit” at level two is defined as a “final agency action” entitling the grievant to judicial review for any judicially recognizable claims.

Spring Harbor's status may only be inferred from operation of 5 M.R.S.A. § 11003 (2002), which required that it be served a copy of the petition for review. <em>See also </em>M.R. Civ. P. 80C(a). No claim was asserted by or against Spring Harbor in the Superior Court proceeding.</p>
