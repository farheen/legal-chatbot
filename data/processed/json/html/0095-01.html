The Secret Service established a “no access area” to restrict access to the high school and the presidential motorcade viewing area. Lyons and 12 to 20 members of an organization, ACT-UP — Portland (“ACT-UP”), gathered in Lewiston on the morning of the presidential visit to protest certain policies of the Bush Administration. They proceeded along East Avenue toward Lewi-ston High School and the motorcade viewing area. Lewiston police officers, including Jones and Carpenter, and Androscoggin County deputy sheriffs advised Lyons and the others that a roped off area, 727 feet from the closest point of the motorcade route, had been designated as a “demonstrator area,” and that they would not be allowed to proceed further. Members of the general public and other demonstrators, however, were allowed to proceed by foot toward the high school and the motorcade viewing area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

When Lyons, who wanted his protest to be visible to the Presidential motorcade, the general public, and the media filming the motorcade, continued along East Avenue for about five to ten yards, Jones arrested him and MeGinley placed and held him in a waiting school bus. Following the advice of the Androscoggin County District Attorney, Sheriffs Department personnel transferred Lyons to the Androscoggin County Jail and charged him with criminal trespass.

Counts II and III were dismissed with Lyons’s acquiescence.

The court also denied the defendants’ motion for a summary judgment with respect to counts I and IV, in which they asserted qualified immunity from liability.
