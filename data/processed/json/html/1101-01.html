(R.R. at 23a.)

However, even as stated, the referee’s finding would have supported the Employer's argument that Claimant's appeal was untimely under section 501(e) of the Law, 43 P.S. § 821(e) because, in interpreting section 501(e), our courts have applied a presumption that notice mailed to Claimant’s last known address and not returned by the postal authorities as undeliverable has been received. <em>Mihelic v.
