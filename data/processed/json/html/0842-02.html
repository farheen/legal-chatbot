In 1970, the Department of Environment Resources (DER), now the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> issued a permit to MIDC for the temporary storage of solid and hazardous wastes, specifically fly ash from a power station. The permit provided, in detail, the manner in which MIDC could store waste and dispose of collected leachate. It did not authorize any off-site discharge of hazardous <a id="p844" href="#p844" data-label="844" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*844</a>waste from the facility. Per the permit, MIDC installed monitoring systems to detect the presence of unpermitted waste discharge. DER subsequently amended the temporary permit, allowing the additional storage of demolition and industrial waste and extending the permit until 1982.</p>
    <p id="b892-4" data-blocks='[["BL_892.4",892,[208,569,758,1294]]]'>Following laboratory tests conducted from 1982 through 1983, DER informed Fiore that hazardous chemicals were migrating from his storage facility. Specifically, DER had discovered the presence of Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene (organic chemicals) in water discharging from MIDC.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In response to its findings, DER required MIDC to apply for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. DER issued the NPDES permit to MIDC in December of 1983. The NPDES permit established a maximum level of allowable hazardous waste discharge from the facility. To circumvent the discharge restrictions, the general manager of MIDC, David Scar-pone, acting pursuant to Fiore’s instruction, directed two welders to modify a mine water discharge pipe. This modification allowed MIDC to control both the discharge of uncontaminated and contaminated waters and allow the flow of hazardous waste through the monitoring wells when detection by DER officials was unlikely.</p>
    <p id="b892-10" data-blocks='[["BL_892.11",892,[1010,187,755,1418]]]'>In July of 1984, a DER inspector discovered an illegal modification. The Commonwealth subsequently filed multiple criminal charges against both Fiore and Scarpone. In 1986, the Commonwealth tried Fiore and Scarpone jointly before a jury in a trial limited to charges against both defendants. Later that same year, in a bench trial, Fiore was tried on charges not involving Scarpone. Among other offenses, a jury convicted Fiore and Scar-pone of “operating a hazardous waste storage, treatment or disposal facility” without a “permit.” 35 P.S. § 6018.401(a). Although the Commonwealth conceded that both men had a permit to operate MIDC, the trial court accepted the prosecution’s argument that their intentional alteration of the facility was such a significant departure from the terms of the permit that the operation of MIDC was without a permit. Only Fiore’s conviction for violating Section 6018.401(a) of the Solid Waste Management Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> (SWMA) is at issue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> For Fiore’s two counts of violating Section 6018.401(a), the trial court imposed two sentences, each of one-half to five years imprisonment, ten years probation, and a fine of $100,000, to run consecutively.</p>

Acting on a Petition from Fiore, the Commonwealth Court transferred his appeal back to the Superior Court because the court found that the facts and issues of Fiore’s appeal were closely related to another appeal taken by him to the Superior Court. In an unpublished memorandum decision, filed May 12, 1989, the Superior Court affirmed his Judgment of Sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, after the Superior Court <em>sua sponte </em>transferred his appeal to the Commonwealth Court, Scar-pone did not request a transfer back to the Superior Court. Thus, the Commonwealth Court heard the appeal of Scarpone. On August 5, 1991, the Commonwealth Court reversed his conviction on the charge of violating Section 6018.401(a). <em>Scarpone v.

The Commonwealth Court concluded that, at all times relevant to the charge, Scarpone had operated MIDC with a valid permit. Concerning the conviction for violating Section 6018.401(a), we affirmed the decision of the Commonwealth Court in an Opinion, filed on December 15, 1993. <em>Commonwealth v.

Because that statutory provision was clear on its face, and <em>Scarpone </em>did not overrule any legal precedent, he argues that our interpretation of Section 6018.401(a) is an expression of the law from the date of the enactment of that statute. Fiore explains that fundamental fairness and constitutional protections necessitate against allowing our society to incarcerate a defendant, who was tried in a joint trial, for the same actions committed by a co-defendant, which we deemed did not violate Section 6018.401(a).</p>
