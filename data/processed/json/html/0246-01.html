We have considered the memorandum of recommendation submitted by the committee and have also examined supporting materials filed therewith. Among these supporting materials were:</p>

However, by way of guidance to the Media Advisory Committee which shall serve as the monitoring agency for an additional year, we feel that the following comments should be made.</p>
    <p id="b299-6" data-blocks='[["BL_299.6",299,[198,938,743,409]]]'>The Media Advisory Committee shall continue to monitor the experimental program, and all trial participants are requested to cooperate with the committee or its agents in implementation of its evaluation.

We are of the opinion that the public understanding of the judicial system and its procedures has not been substantially furthered by televising, broadcasting or photographing during the experimental period. We therefore call to the attention of representatives of the media their obligation to further the goal of public education. This goal is the sole justification for the assumption of additional burdens by trial judges and other participants in the trial process in adjusting to and dealing with the presence of broadcasting, television, and still photography in the courtroom during court proceedings.</p>
