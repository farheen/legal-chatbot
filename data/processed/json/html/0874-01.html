LCA managed both properties. Both corporations enjoyed common ownership. At that time, LCA had plans to develop 359 Thames Street into a condominium complex but lacked the requisite space for parking to comply with city zoning ordinances. So, on April 14, 1982, the Landing Development Company granted an easement to LCA “exclusive for purposes of parking” <a id="p876" href="#p876" data-label="876" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*876</a>at 360 Thames Street.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>.

Thereafter, the property at 359 Thames Street was developed into a large, multi-unit, timeshare/hotel complex. The property at 360 Thames Street contains a six-unit condominium complex, with a two-story, forty-four-space parking lot.</p>
    <p id="b906-5" data-blocks='[["BL_906.5",906,[215,914,756,1028]]]'>Although the easement required LCA to contribute toward its share of the parking expenses, it was not until 1990, when LCA no longer managed the property, that payment became an issue. A dispute arose between the parties when LCA réfused to reimburse its proportional amount of the expenses as determined by 360 Thames Street. On September 14, 1993, 360 Thames Street filed the instant action in the Newport County Superior Court. It sought reimbursement from LCA for its share of expenses incurred since 1990,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> as well as for all of the costs, interest and attorney’s expenses associated with the suit. In addition, pursuant to G.L.1956 chapter 30 of title 9, it asked the Superior Court to declare that the easement had terminated and that LCA no longer had any interest in the property.</p>

After hearing testimony and reviewing the evidence, the trial justice issued a written decision in which she found LCA to be completely responsible for its proportionate share of the taxes and expenses of operating and maintaining the easement parking spaces. She declined plaintiffs request to order LCA to pay into a “sinking fund” for future expenses and declined to declare that the easement had terminated.</p>
    <p id="b906-9" data-blocks='[["BL_906.9",906,[1017,731,753,1018]]]'>The trial justice accepted as credible testimony that the average value of each parking space was $10,000. In a judgment amended later, she ordered LCA to be responsible for 19 percent of 360 Thames Street’s real estate tax expenses and other expenses, such as maintenance of the sprinkler system, insurance, repair, maintenance, lighting and management costs. The parties have stipulated that LCA would be responsible for 52 percent of other, more specific parking expenses, such as line painting, cleaning, etc. The trial justice awarded plaintiff $39,983.18 minus “credit for prior payments made by defendant in the amount of $9,492.50,” plus statutory interest to be added “commencing January 1, 1992, together with plaintiffs costs of this action.” Both parties timely cross appealed the judgment.</p>

The defendant also asserts that the trial justice erroneously calculated damages from January 1, 1992, after she “plainly indicated on the bench that damages should be awarded as of July 1, 1992.” Finally, defendant maintains that the trial justice erred as a matter of law in ordering it to pay property taxes on the easement when there was no evidence that plaintiffs themselves actually paid taxes on the disputed area.</p>

The city tax assessor, Allan Booth, testified that the city annually collects taxes for the first level of the parking garage, but that those taxes are not assessed or collected separately from the other taxes assessed against 360 Thames Street. In addition, he said that the value or benefit of the easement was not identifiable as a part of LCA’s tax assessment.</p>

She determined that proportion by rounding up the percentage proposed by defendant’s expert witness from 18.18 percent to 19 percent. LCA contends that the trial justice erred in rounding up that percentage up to 19 percent and maintains that, instead, she should have rounded it down to 18 percent.</p>
    <p id="b910-10" data-blocks='[["BL_910.11",910,[1018,384,751,560]]]'>At trial, various experts presented estimates of LCA’s tax expense allocation ranging from 19 to 23.5 percent, any of which the trial justice properly could have accepted. In addition, defense expert, James Mercurio (Mercurio), estimated that LCA’s proportionate share of the annual cost of the fire suppression system to be 18.18 percent by calculating the actual cost of the sprinklers in the easement area. The trial justice held defendant to be:</p>

The Court accepts as credible the testimony of Tax Assessor Booth that the average value of a parking space in the relevant Thames Street area is $10,000. With reference to the maintenance of the sprinkler system, insurance, cleaning, repair maintenance, lighting and management costs, the Court endorses Mr. Mercurio’s percentage, calculated by sprinkler heads, of 19% (rounded off).”</blockquote>
    <p id="b910-11" data-blocks='[["BL_910.13",910,[1015,1705,752,663]]]'>When calculated as a percentage, the $10,000 average value of each parking space exceeded 19 percent of the total value of the 360 Thames Street property. Accordingly, the trial justice could have found that LCA’s tax expense to be that same percentage amount. Instead, however, in an attempt to do substantial justice between the parties, she calculated LCA’s proportionate share of the parking expenses<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and taxes to amount to 19 percent.

In that ruling, she denied damages to plaintiff for any period before July 1, 1992, because none of the current owners had an ownership interest in 360 Thames Street before that date. For its part, 360 Thames Street contends that the trial justice erred in not awarding damages for 1990 and 1991. It asserts that since 1990, two of the condominium units at 360 Thames Street were owned by a current owner and that G.L.1956 chapter 36.1 of title 34, entitled the Rhode Island Condominium Act, empowered the condominium association to sue on behalf of the owners, regardless of who the specific owners might have been at the time.</p>

The trial justice reasonably relied upon this admission and ruled that LCA was not responsible to reimburse any tax payments made before July 1, 1992. However, when the subsequent judgment was entered, she ordered damages and interest to commence as of January 1, 1992, rather than July 1, 1992. Such change of date was error.</p>
