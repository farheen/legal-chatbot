We hold that it is not and hence dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

During the time period covered by the complaint, Judith was the executive secretary to the Executive Assistant to the President of the GCIU. All defendants moved to have the case referred to arbitration, relying on the arbitration clause contained in the collective bargaining agreement between the GCIU and the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 2 (the “Agreement”). Judith responded that, although she was a dues paying member of Local 2, she was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
    <p id="b945-5" data-blocks='[["BL_945.5",945,[188,1120,752,514]]]'>After first denying the defendants’ motion, the court reconsidered based on extrinsic evidence submitted by the defendants. The court requested argument on the issue during a scheduling conference and orally reversed its prior decision, stating, “I am going to ... dismiss this case in favor of arbitration.” Judith appeals this ruling, along with a ruling denying what she termed a Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration based on additional competing extrinsic evidence.</p>

    <p id="b945-13" data-blocks='[["BL_945.13",945,[988,1611,754,748]]]'>To begin with, this was not an outright dismissal of the action. The Motion for Dismissal of Action and Referral to Arbitration upon which the court was ruling requested that “the plaintiff be directed to utilize the grievance procedures of the collective bargaining agreement as mandated by the District of Columbia Uniform Arbitration Act, D.C.Code § 16-4301 (1998) (‘DCUAA’).” The trial court in its oral ruling stated that it was dismissing the case “in favor of arbitration.” The docket entry for that date states: “Case dismissed in favor of binding arbitration pursuant to union agreement between parties.

      <a id="p892" href="#p892" data-label="892" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*892</a>Furthermore, the DCUAA requires a stay of litigation when arbitration is to take place, and therefore the court’s authority to dismiss the case was at best doubtful. D.C.Code § 16-4302(d). Although the defendants moved for a dismissal, and that is how the court responded, we have made interpretations to effectuate the purpose of the DCUAA in the past. In <em>Hercules &amp; Co. v. Beltway Carpet Serv., Inc., </em>we stated that the defendant’s “motion to dismiss must be seen as a motion to compel arbitration,” noting that “the granting of the motion to ‘dismiss’ would not have resulted in the dismissal of count 1, but rather in a stay of the litigation as to that claim, pending the outcome of arbitration.” <a href="/a2d/592/1069-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="592 A.2d 1069" data-case-ids="7379159" data-case-paths="/a2d/592/1069-01">592 A.2d 1069</a>, 1071, 1073 (D.C.1991) (internal citation omitted). Similarly, in <em>Robinson v. Booker, </em>we explained that “appellant’s original motion ... had sought a dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the contract compelled arbitration; accordingly, that motion must be seen as the application for compelled arbitration ...” <a href="/a2d/561/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="561 A.2d 483" data-case-ids="7349252" data-case-paths="/a2d/561/0483-01">561 A.2d 483</a>, 484 (D.C.1989).</p>

The Seventh Circuit noted that “a rule that gave weight to whether the district judge dismissed rather than stayed an action would allow a district court to determine the jurisdiction of an appellate court,” an arbitrary result that would not comport with what Congress intended “when it barred appellate review of interlocutory orders compelling arbitration.” <em>Napleton v. GMC, </em><a href="/f3d/138/1209-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="138 F.3d 1209" data-case-ids="256933" data-case-paths="/f3d/138/1209-01">138 F.3d 1209</a>, 1213 (7th Cir.1998). <em>See also McCarthy v.

No written order or docketing of a judgment ever followed. This presents another potentially significant bar to finality here resulting from the failure to comply with Super. Ct. Civ. R. 58. That rule requires that "every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document. A judgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered as provided in Rule 79(a).” This court has enforced Rule 58 in the past, while acknowledging the exception developed in federal courts whereby the requirement is deemed waived if no <a id="p892" href="#p892" data-label="892" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*892</a>party objects, and “it is clear that the trial court intended its action to be the final decision in the case." <em>Williams v.
