Peroxide of hydrogen is a chemical product, so-called because it consists of a molecule of two atoms of oxygen and two of hydrogen. Its use as a disinfectant is old, and the plaintiff began to make and sell it in 1890, under the name “ Peroxide of Hydrogen, O. 0.,” though its more proper chemical name is “ Dioxid of Hydrogen ” or “ Hydrogen Dioxid.” The plaintiff, after using the second of these names for a while, in 1901 changed to “ Dioxogen,” which it registered as a trade-mark in 1903 and again in 1924. It has spent large sums in advertising the product under that name and has registered the same mark in more than thirty foreign countries.</blockquote>
