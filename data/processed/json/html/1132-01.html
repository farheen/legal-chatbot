Generally, an elector wishing to vote by absentee ballot due to a physical disability must submit an absentee ballot application to the appropriate board of elections, which must include a statement that he is physically unable to go to the polls, a declaration stating the nature of the disability and the name, address and telephone number of his treating physician. 25 P.S. §§ 3146.2(a) and (e)(2).</p>

Thus, the Committee contends that the trial court was correct in concluding that election judges are authorized to seek assistance in maneuvering the voting machines in place and in obtaining and returning the registration binders and related election materials before and after elections.
