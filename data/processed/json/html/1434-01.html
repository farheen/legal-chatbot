Geary was on parole from the sentence imposed in that case when he committed another murder. For this second murder, Geary was convicted of one count of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. On direct appeal, this court affirmed Geary’s conviction and sentence. Geary v. State, <a href="/nev/110/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Nev. 261" data-case-ids="8557576" data-case-paths="/nev/110/0261-01">110 Nev. 261</a>, <a href="/nev/110/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="110 Nev. 261" data-case-ids="8557576" data-case-paths="/nev/110/0261-01">871 P.2d 927</a> (1994). Geary petitioned this court for rehearing, arguing that error occurred at both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. In an order entered on September 29, 1994, we granted Geary’s petition for rehearing, and directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs. Having considered the briefs on rehearing, we agree that error occurred at the penalty phase of Geary’s trial. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand this case for a new penalty hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b619-8" data-blocks='[["BL_619.7",619,[184,1281,1124,221]]]'>In July 1992, shortly after committing the crime, Geary confessed to murdering his roommate Edward Colvin with a boning knife. Geary had been drinking at the time. Following a trial, a jury found Geary guilty of one count of first-degree murder with use of a deadly weapon.</p>
    <p id="b619-9" data-blocks='[["BL_619.8",619,[187,1508,1124,622]]]'>Geary had previously confessed to murdering another person in a similar manner in 1973. For that earlier murder, a jury found Geary guilty of one count of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This court affirmed his conviction. Geary v. State, <a href="/nev/91/0784-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="91 Nev. 784" data-case-ids="8559595" data-case-paths="/nev/91/0784-01">91 Nev. 784</a>, <a href="/nev/91/0784-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="91 Nev. 784" data-case-ids="8559595" data-case-paths="/nev/91/0784-01">544 P.2d 417</a> (1975) <em>(Geary </em>I). In 1980, the Pardons Board commuted Geary’s sentence to a sentence of life with the possibility of parole. After several appearances before the Parole Board, Geary was released on parole in 1986, in large part because he was an exemplary prisoner who received commendations for his service to the prison and the community. One of the conditions of Geary’s parole was that he abstain from alcohol. Geary violated this condition of his parole several times, and on one occasion was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.427.</p>

At the penalty hearing for Colvin’s murder, the jury was fully informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding Geary’s previous conviction, commutation and parole. After the penalty hearing, the jury found the following three aggravating circumstances: (1) that Geary committed the murder while under sentence of imprisonment (i.e., parole) for the 1973 murder; (2) that Geary was previously convicted of another murder (the 1973 murder) in Nevada; and (3) that the murder was committed at random and without apparent motive. The jury found that “any mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstance^) ” and imposed the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[202,849,1125,491]]]'>Geary appealed, arguing that: (1) the district court should have excluded his confessions because they were involuntary; (2) the district court gave an improper state-of-mind instruction; (3) the penalty-phase verdict was impermissibly tainted by juror misconduct; and (4) the district court allowed the jury to consider duplicative aggravating circumstances at the penalty phase. This court affirmed the conviction and sentence in a per curiam opinion. Geary v. State, <a href="/nev/110/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="110 Nev. 261" data-case-ids="8557576" data-case-paths="/nev/110/0261-01">110 Nev. 261</a>, <a href="/nev/110/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="110 Nev. 261" data-case-ids="8557576" data-case-paths="/nev/110/0261-01">871 P.2d 927</a> (1994) <em>(Geary II). </em>In that opinion, this court rejected each of these contentions, and conducted a <em>sua sponte </em>review of the penalty phase instructions and of the sentence, finding both to be proper.</p>

    <p id="b620-8" data-blocks='[["BL_620.7",620,[194,1585,1127,676]]]'>On rehearing, Geary contends that error occurred at both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. Concerning guilt phase error, Geary contends that his rights to due process and to a reliable verdict were violated. Concerning penalty phase error, Geary contends that: (1) the jury instruction regarding the possibility of commutation of his sentence was misleading and violated his constitutional rights to due process and a reliable sentence; (2) the “random and without apparent motive” aggravating circumstance violated his rights to due process, to a reliable sentence, and to not incriminate himself; (3) the two aggravating circumstances based on his prior conviction and on his being under sentence of imprisonment for the same conviction violated the prohibition against double jeopardy and deprived him of due process and a reliable sentence; and (4) constitutional defects in other penalty phase instructions require reversal of his sentence.</p>

Geary argues that his rights to due process and to a reliable verdict were violated by: (1) the jury instruction which defined a reasonable doubt as one which would “control” a person’s behavior; (2) the jury instruction on premeditation and deliberation which conflated first and second degree murder because it defined premeditation as an intent to kill which can be formed at or instantaneously before the killing; and (3) the finding that he used a deadly weapon based on the use of a boning knife.</p>

We disagree with Geary’s contentions. The jury instruction on reasonable doubt is a stock instruction, identical to that given in Lord v.

This case is distinguishable from previous cases in which we upheld the “random and motiveless” aggravating circumstance; in this case Geary knew and lived with his victim and expressed resentment of him. Geary had moved in with Colvin because Geary was unemployed, homeless, and had no money. Because there were no eyewitnesses and Geary did not testify, we cannot ascertain the exact circumstances of the murder. Nevertheless, evidence adduced at trial suggests that the murder was neither random nor motiveless. Although the state argued that the killing was random because Geary “went oif like a volcano” whenever he drank, and would kill anyone who happened to be there, the evidence indicates that Geary killed Colvin because Colvin was “taunting” him. Geary was “pissed off” because Colvin, who was characterized as outspoken and belittling, “had it all, and I had nothing.” Geary told his ex-girlfriend that he had been in a fight, and Colvin had defensive wounds, suggesting that there was a struggle in which Colvin resisted. Geary also told police officers that he had taken money from Colvin. This evidence suggests that the killing was directed at a specific individual (Colvin) and was for a reason (anger, jealousy, money).

Rather, he argues that his prior conviction should not be parsed into two separate sentencing considerations for the purpose of meting out punishment for the instant offense. Moreover, the aggravating circumstances do not violate Geary’s rights to due process or a reliable sentence. The first aggravating circumstance advances the state’s interest in punishing more harshly those who commit murder after having been granted the privilege of parole, and the second aggravator advances the state’s interest in punishing more harshly repeat offenders. Both of those interests are advanced in this case even though the aggravating circumstances arise from the same underlying criminal offense.</p>

Geary argues at length that the penalty phase instructions failed to provide specific and detailed guidance to the jury and thus violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due process and against cruel and unusual punishment. First, Geary contends that the instructions misled the jury into believing that mitigating circumstances had to be found unanimously before they could be weighed against the aggravating circumstances. Geary contends that, in light of the extensive mitigating evidence presented during the penalty phase, this error cannot be considered harmless. Geary further contends that the jury was not explicitly instructed that aggravating circumstances had to be found unanimously and that the penalty phase instructions as a whole did not adequately specify how the <a id="p1449" href="#p1449" data-label="1449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1449</a>penalty determination was to be made. He attacks the structure of the statutory death penalty scheme and argues that appellate reweighing is wrong. Geary asserts that this court’s decision in Allen v.

The jury was instructed that a death sentence, in essence, would result in a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole, with the threat of execution hanging over Geary’s head in the event he sought parole or commutation of his sentence. Thus, there is a reasonable probability that the jury did not realize that the death sentence which it imposed would actually be carried out. “[I]t is constitutionally impermissible to rest a sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant’s death rests elsewhere.” Caldwell v.
