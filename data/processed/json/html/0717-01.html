S.A. § 252 (Supp.1978) charged that defendant “Robert James Colson did by force and against her will compel [the prosecutrix] to engage in sexual intercourse, [the prosecu-trix] not being his spouse.” This indictment tracked the language of subsection (l)B(l) of the rape statute, which defines one form of compulsion to submit to sexual intercourse as being that exerted “by force and against the person’s will”; it did not include the language of subsection (1)B(2), which defines another form of compulsion, namely, a “threat that death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping will be imminently inflicted on the person or on any other human being.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the jury-waived trial the Superior Court justice found that defendant compelled the prosecutrix to submit to their admitted sexual intercourse, not by physical force,.but rather by implied threats of a lesser magnitude than “death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping.” Holding that proof of compulsion by such lesser implied threats is adequate under section 252 to establish rape “by force and against the person’s will,” the trial justice convicted defendant of the crime charged by the indictment. Since we cannot read <a id="p718" href="#p718" data-label="718" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*718</a>the rape provisions of the Criminal Code in the same way as the trial justice, we must sustain defendant’s appeal and reverse his conviction for the particular crime for which he was indicted. Although the court’s findings could well have supported convictjon “beyond a reasonable doubt” for another offense under the Code, that other offense was not charged by the indictment.</p>
    <p id="A6z" data-blocks='[["BL_782.4",782,[193,723,748,967]]]'>On the day of the alleged crime, the 57-year-old prosecutrix walked to a Brewer restaurant located about a quarter mile from the foster home where she was residing following her release from Bangor Mental Health Institute. While in the restaurant she met defendant Colson, who offered her a ride home. She accepted, but he drove off with her in a direction opposite her home. After about twenty minutes of driving, Colson stopped his car in a secluded area in Orrington and he and the prosecu-trix there engaged in sexual intercourse. The trial justice, sitting as the fact-finder in the jury-waived trial, found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant compelled the prosecutrix to submit to sexual intercourse by employing a threat, implied in his course of conduct, that amounted to something less than a threat of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping.</p>

After taking the question under advisement, the justice held that the words of section 252(1)(B)(1), “by force and against the person’s will,” under which defendant was indicted and tried, were not limited to physical force alone, but also included “constructive” force arising from conduct carrying with it the implicit threat of force. In so construing the rape statute, the Superior Court justice relied upon the pre-Code case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Mower, </em>Me., <a href="/a2d/298/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="298 A.2d 759" data-case-ids="11253719" data-case-paths="/a2d/298/0759-01">298 A.2d 759</a>, 760 (1973), which approved a jury instruction that “the force which the State must prove may be either actual physical force or threat of force.”</p>

The language and structure of those sections lead us unhesitatingly to the conclusions (1) that the Code draws a distinction between two separate types of rape<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (as well as of Class A gross sexual misconduct), depending on the form of the compulsion involved, and (2) that if the compulsion takes the form of a threat, only proof of a threat of “death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping” will suffice to convict for rape or Class A gross sexual misconduct.</p>

We see no reason to read the bifurcated language of those sections to say anything different from its facial meaning. The forms of compulsion identified among the elements of these two most serious sex offenses are in both sections 252(1) and 253(1) separated by the word “or.” We must take that conjunction to serve the function of separating two alternatives that are mutually exclusive. It would be strange legislative drafting to use “force” in the first alternative so broadly as to encompass “threats of force,” a type of compulsion specifically and expressly addressed in the second alternative. To ascribe such an all-embracing meaning to the word “force” in the first alternative would render futile the limitation on the types of threats which the language of the second alternative expressly imposes.</p>

That case involved a conviction under our ancient rape statute, 17 M.R.S.A. § 3151 (1964) (repealed May 1, 1976), which condemned “[wjhoever ravishes and carnally knows any female who has attained her 14th birthday, <em>by force and against her will." </em>(Emphasis added). In that prior statute, whose language predated Maine’s statehood,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the single above-emphasized phrase encompassed “constructive” force arising from threats, as well as actual physical force. Thus held <em>Mower, </em>and understandably so. The Code drafters were, however, not satisfied to use the ancient language with its judicial encrustations to do the job of defining either rape or the newly delineated crime of Class A gross sexual misconduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> They specified exactly what kinds of threats operating as the coercive agent compelling sexual intercourse or sexual acts must be alleged and proved to support a conviction of rape or the related section 253 crime.

A clear statutory pattern emerges: If a defendant uses a threat (whether express or implied) of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping to compel another person to engage in sexual intercourse or a sexual act, he may be convicted of Class A rape in violation of section 252(1)(B)(2), or Class A gross sexual misconduct in violation of section 253(1)(A)(2), either offense carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. On the other hand, sexual intercourse or a sexual act compelled or induced by <em>use </em>of any lesser threat (whether express or implied) gives rise only to liability under section 253(2)(B) for Class C gross sexual misconduct, an offense carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years.</p>
