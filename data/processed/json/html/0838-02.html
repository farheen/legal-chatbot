    <p id="b892-5" data-blocks='[["BL_892.5",892,[213,739,751,998]]]'>Plaintiffs, who formerly leased a residence in Gorham from defendants, filed a complaint for forcible entry and detainer of personal property, 14 M.R.S.A. § 6012, in District Court on December 29, 1981. The next day, defendants filed an answer and claim of title asserting that they owned certain of the items of personal property sought by plaintiffs, <em>i.e., </em>a stove, a baby gate, a smoke alarm system, and a fence, including 35 fence posts, one spool of wire, and two bags of insulators. In an accompanying affidavit, defendant Dodge alleged that he had purchased the stove and that, despite a discussion with plaintiffs regarding a sale to them, he retained title to it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Dodge’s affidavit further alleged that the last three items listed were attached to and thus were improvements to the property, and that, under the terms of the lease, improvements became his property upon termination of the lease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Defendant Dodge testified to the facts alleged in his affidavit and further testified that removal of the baby gate and alarm system would damage the dwelling to which they were attached. Plaintiffs testified that 1) they had purchased the baby gate, the alarm system, and the fencing materials and had erected the fence; 2) the first two items were not permanently attached to the premises; 3) they had not agreed that the fence would become the property of defendants; and 4) they had purchased the stove from defendants for $75 in November of 1981, had paid nine installments of $5 each, and were ready, willing and able to pay the remaining $30 owed to defendants.</p>

    <p id="b892-11" data-blocks='[["BL_892.11",892,[1010,1111,741,257]]]'>Under 14 M.R.S.A. § 6012, if the defendant in a forcible entry and detainer action claims title to the personal property sought, the action is normally removed to Superior Court; however, section 6012 further provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b892-12" data-blocks='[["BL_892.12",892,[1046,1386,703,312]]]'>The plaintiff may make a written allegation that the defendant’s claim of title is frivolous and intended for delay and the judge shall then examine the case so far as to ascertain the truth of the allegation and if satisfied of the truth thereof, he shall proceed to try the cause ....</blockquote>
    <p id="b892-13" data-blocks='[["BL_892.13",892,[1006,1716,741,398]]]'>This appeal presents us with two issues. First, we must decide how the District Court shall determine whether a claim is frivolous. Specifically, we must determine the meaning of the terms “frivolous” and “examine the case” as used in section 6012. Second, we must ascertain whether defendants’ claim of title in this case is frivolous under that statute.</p>
    <p id="b892-14" data-blocks='[["BL_892.14",892,[1042,2166,548,34]]]'>A. <em>Construction of the Statute</em>

    <p id="AOr" data-blocks='[["BL_892.15",892,[1005,2224,739,85]],["BL_893.1",893,[195,273,746,574]]]'>At the threshold, it is clear that the issue before the District Court on a plaintiff’s <a id="p841" href="#p841" data-label="841" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*841</a>written allegation that a defendant’s claim of title is “frivolous and intended for delay” is the truth of that allegation. By the language of the last paragraph of 14 M.R. S.A. § 6012, the District Court judge shall examine the case to ascertain the truth of the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant’s claim is frivolous. The purpose of the judge’s examination of the case is <em>not </em>to determine title, except to the limited extent that a conclusion that a claim is frivolous is a determination of title adverse to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b893-4" data-blocks='[["BL_893.4",893,[191,876,750,1436]]]'>As to the meaning of the expression “examine the case,” we reject the contention that section 6012 limits the judge to an examination of the pleadings and affidavits only. By its terms, section 6012 is distinguishable from M.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) and from M.R.Civ. P. 56 (summary judgment). First, the words “examine <em>the case" </em>in section 6012 suggest something more than the mere examination of the pleadings. Second, Rule 12(b)(6) clearly states that motions pursuant to those rules are to be decided on pleadings alone; such language is conspicuously absent from section 6012. Motions for summary judgment are, under Rule 56(e), to be granted or denied on the basis of the pleadings supplemented only by affidavits and the written results of discovery; section 6012 imposes no such limitation on the District Court’s examination of “the case.” As with any issue of fact to be determined by the District Court in a forcible entry and detainer action, the fact that the proceeding is summary does not limit the judge in the nature of the evidence that he can receive to decide the question. <em>See </em>M.D.C.Civ.R. 80D. If he thinks one is appropriate, the judge is free to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the defendant’s claim of title is frivolous.</p>
    <p id="b893-5" data-blocks='[["BL_893.5",893,[190,2338,745,312]],["BL_893.6",893,[990,274,745,499]]]'>We now turn to the question of the meaning of the adjective “frivolous” in the context of section 6012. As a starting point, it is helpful to examine the Statement of Fact appended to L.D. 743, the bill that became P.L.1979, ch. 231, adding the last paragraph to section 6012 in order to prevent frivolous claims of title from requiring removal to the Superior Court. The Statement of Fact reads, “The problem arises when the defendant’s claim to ownership is <em>clearly without merit </em>By raising a <em>sham issue </em>the defendant delays the judgment .... ” L.D. 743, Statement of Fact (109th Legis., 1979) (emphasis added). This language conveys an intent to include in the category of frivolous claims only those that are utterly without merit.</p>

Generally, a claim is considered frivolous and intended for delay only when the claim is totally devoid of merit. <em>See Dillingham v. Wainwright, </em><a href="/f-supp/422/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="422 F.

The purpose of empowering the District Court to reject frivolous claims is to protect the legislative objective of vesting original jurisdiction over forcible entry and detainer actions exclusively in the District Court, where, by M.D.C. Civ.R. 80D, they must be given expedited consideration. The District Court’s power to involve itself in title issues should not be construed any more broadly than is necessary to implement that limited purpose.
