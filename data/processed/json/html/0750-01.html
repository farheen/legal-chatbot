      <a id="p752" href="#p752" data-label="752" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*752</a>It appears from the record that golf clubs were originally made with wood shafts which, in time, became warped and loose in the club heads; that, since about 1923, steel shafts have, to a considerable extent, displaced the wood shafts; that, although steel shafts do not warp or become loose, their use presented a new problem to the art — that of vibration, particularly in clubs (irons) composed of steel shafts and metal heads. To solve this problem, a resilient member or sleeve was interposed between the lower end portion of the shaft and the neck of the club head. For this advance in the art, patent No. 1,551,563 was issued September 21, 1925 to one P. E. Heller. It appears, however, that in spite of the patentee Heller’s contribution to the art there remained considerable vibration in steel-shaft clubs, with consequent stinging of the hands of users. It further appears from the record that manufacturers of golf clubs indicate on the face of each -club head at approximately its geometrical center, by circular or other marks, where it should come in contact with the golf ball in order to secure the best results. The weight of such club heads, however, is not so distributed that the center of mass is at the indicated point of contact.</p>
    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[215,1213,1324,343]]]'>Appellant contends that he has solved the problem confronting the art — the elimination of vibration — by providing a properly balanced club head; that is, a club head with its weight so distributed as to bring the center of mass at approximately the geometrical center of the striking face of the club head. Appellant also contends that his balanced club head greatly aids the player in controlling the direction of the flight of the ball.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[213,1563,1324,442]]]'>Generally, although appellant’s application is not limited to any specific form, it may be said that the weight of appellant’s club head is distributed by forming a recess in the rear face, the recess being widely adjacent the neck of the club head and diminishing progressively upwardly toward the toe, as stated, for example, in appealed claim 31. As compared with golf club heads commonly in use, the weight of appellant’s club head is shifted more toward the toe. As an aid in so shifting the weight, the neck of the club head may be reduced in weight.</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[212,2013,1323,84]]]'>One feature of appellant’s alleged invention is referred to in his brief as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b70-7" data-blocks='[["BL_70.7",70,[211,2133,1324,199]]]'>A subsidiary feature of the invention relates to the shape of the upper face of a club head. In some of the several forms illustrated in the drawings this extends over the full width of the head and is flat, with parallel sides. In a putter such edges serve as a guide or gauge to help the player in lining up the putter head with reference to the cup; so-called “sighting” of the ball.</blockquote>

No claims are allowed for' <em>either of the Uoo aibove mentioned featwes alone. </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[99,514,1326,246]]]'>The patent to Doerr relates to golf clubs, more particularly to putters. It discloses a putter with a concave face. The patent was cited by the Primary Examiner, because, he said, figure 5 thereof discloses a club head face having its upper and lower edges parallel to each other- — one of the features in appealed claim 29.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[99,766,1327,298]]]'>The patent to G-ovan relates to golf clubs, and discloses golf club heads with apertures in the rear face of the club heads and discs of varying weights to be inserted in such apertures for the purpose of shifting the weight of the club head as desired by the user. The patentee stated that the apertures might extend partly or entirely through the club head.</p>
    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[100,1068,1327,235]]]'>In Ms statement of August 20, 1936, the Primary Examiner stated that the Govan patent “specifically claims a club which has means for adjusting the center of gravity with respect to the head,” and that “to position the center of gravity behind the center of impact would not involve invention.”</p>

The material in the club is so positioned that the weight of material on the toe side of the club is equal to the weight of material on the heel side of tbe club, tbe material in the hosel being considered as part of the heel. In other words, it is intended that the center of mass of the entire head will lie on the same vertical line as the intended center of impact.</blockquote>

Obviously, if it did not involve invention to construct a club head having its center of mass on the same vertical line as the intended center of impact, in view of the disclosures in the patents to Govan and Spikeer, as was held in the case of <em>In re </em>Schmidt, supra, it would not involve invention in the instant case, in view of the patent to Govan (the disclosure in the Spiker patent being merely cumulative in that case, so far as the issues here are concerned), to so distribute the weight of the club head that its center of mass is approximately in line with the geometrical center of its striking face.</p>
