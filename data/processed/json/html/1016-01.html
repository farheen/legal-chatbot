The yokes carry concentric shafts 59 and 61 which have pinions 60 and 62 on their ends engaging oppositely facing bevel gears 63 and 64 on the <a id="p1018" href="#p1018" data-label="1018" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1018</a>axle.

The knife elements are made of high grade steel, and are cut away to form relatively narrow blades 69 which are twisted at their bases to form a slight angle with the knife member 68 as shown in Figures 11 and 12. The end blade 70 is preferably formed separately from the knife member 68 and is removably secured thereto by the bolt 71.</blockquote>

The soil slicing blades cut diagonally across the row, the blades 69 being twisted to preseut their sharpened edges to the soil, and slice the soil without materially displacing it. The grouping knives following the soil slicing knives, slip through the previously loosened soil and cut out the weeds and plants without materially displacing the soil, the knives cooperating to leave blocks untouched as shown diagrammatically in Figure 21. As the grouping knives are shorter than the slicing knives they only pass through the previously loosened soil, and consequently do not displace the soil. As both sets of blades are twisted with their sharpened edges arranged in the plane of the cut, the result is a perfectly clean-cutting operation. The soil is left in substantially its original position but is thoroughly loosened and aerated. The soil has not been brushed away but has been loosened to form a blanket which in dry weather acts as a blotter to draw moisture to the surface. This result is due to the use of sharpened blades arranged to slice or shave the soil ahead of the grouping knives in order that the latter may slip through the loosened soil and remove <a id="p1019" href="#p1019" data-label="1019" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1019</a>the plants without removing the soil.

    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[71,365,1324,446]]]'>From an examination of appellant’s specifications and drawings, and from the affidavits of disinterested persons filed in the Patent Office and before us here, we are satisfied that the appellant’s device will operate substantially as he has above described it. In other words, the device will loosen the soil, block off the plants and destroy the vegetation outside of the blocks, without removing the soil from its original location. This result is brought about by the use of the sharp slicing and grouping knives which pass through the soil but leave it in position.</p>

Fellows’s device is a 2-wheeled weeding machine. On the end of a shaft projecting behind the wheels, are “ two oppositely rotating disk-shaped brushes or series of brushes, preferably made of wires or long stiff rods or fibers, arranged to rotate oppositely to each other at high and preferably different speeds, and operating in a plane at right angles to their path of travel.” These brushes may be made of segments, leaving gaps, and thus making it possible to leave hills in the row as the machine proceeds.</p>

    <p id="b470-3" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[252,408,1323,595]]]'>Obviously, the idea here is to whip and tear the excess vegetation out of the row, to throw it to one side, and leave hills in the row. This can not be done without a considerable displacement of soil away from the rows and blocked plants. The idea involved is almost the exact opposite of that involved in appellant’s device. It is well known that some years ago farmers generally employed agricultural implements in cultivating crops such as corn, which left the plants standing in elevated rows, but later found that a different cultivation, leaving the soil well loosened, but in place, was a better method, and produced a useful mulch for the growing plants. The same idea is involved here. We are unable to see wherein Fellows had or disclosed any conception of this fact.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[245,1013,1323,792]]]'>It is said by the board that the use of similar knives or blades is taught by the references Carroll, Hartsell, and Hyde. Hyde discloses a device for breaking up tough sod, consisting of two propellor cutters, with opposite twists, intended to tear up the soil, in lieu of a plow. Hartsell discloses a cotton chopper, with an oscillating double edged hoe, including a cultivator which follows the hoe, loosens the soil and turns it back upon the row. The Carroll reference also discloses a cotton chopper, having a rotating disk bearing chopping blades or hoes. The reference Vrooman is also relied upon by the examiner1, who states that this reference “ shows a wide variety of interchangeable rotary elements,.” It is true that Vrooman refers to the fact that the rotary cultivator may be varied according to the desires of the operator and the size of the plants. In all cases, however, the means disclosed are brushes or prongs, and in no instance does he disclose the idea of knives or blades such as those of appellant.</p>
