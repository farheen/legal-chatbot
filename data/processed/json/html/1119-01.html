It is well-settled that “[(Improper venue shall be raised by preliminary objection and if not so raised shall be waived.” Pa.R.C.P. 1006(e). Moreover, this Court has previously held that “[questions of personal jurisdiction, venue and notice ... must be raised at the first reasonable opportunity or they are waived.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Because Restaurant raised its objections to venue at the first available opportunity in preliminary objections, it complied with the appropriate procedural rules. As the trial court noted, “[Restaurant] originally filed its Preliminary Objections challenging venue on October 12, 1999. On October 21,1999, [Restaurant] served Interrogatories and a Request for Production of Documents upon [appellant].” Trial Court Opinion, 5/16/00, at 3-4 (footnote omitted). It was certainly reasonable for Restaurant to conduct discovery while waiting for the trial court’s ruling on its preliminary objections. Restaurant thus did not waive its objection to venue.</p>

To determine whether venue is indeed improper, the court relies on facts raised “by depositions or otherwise.” Pa.R.C.P. 1028(c)(2).

By contrast, our state rule requires the defendant company to “regularly conduct[ ] business” in the county in which the plaintiff seeks venue, Pa.R.C.P. 2179(a), leading us to an analysis of the quality and quantity of the defendant’s business contacts with the forum. <em>Masel, </em><a href="/a2d/689/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="689 A.2d 314" data-case-ids="11924461,11979090" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0314-01,/pa-super/456/0041-01">689 A.2d at 317</a>.

To begin, we need not enter into a quality/quantity analysis for the driving directions and or email newsletter because both of those are attempts to solicit business, and in that way they are comparable to advertising in a newspaper or telephone book. Our Supreme Court has held that “[i]t is ... clear that advertisements in Philadelphia’s phone books and newspapers also fail to meet our standards for the exercise of venue. Mere solicitation of business in a particular county does not amount to conducting business.” <em>Purcell, </em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">579 A.2d at 1287</a>.

We therefore turn to our quality/quantity of contacts analysis. As noted above, we focus on whether the corporation’s acts are “‘directly, furthering or essential to, corporate objects.’ ” <em>Masel, </em><a href="/a2d/689/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="689 A.2d 314" data-case-ids="11924461,11979090" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0314-01,/pa-super/456/0041-01">689 A.2d at 317</a> (quoting <em>Purcell, </em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">579 A.2d at 1285</a>). “[T]hose [acts] in ‘aid of a main purpose’ are collateral and incidental, while ‘those necessary to its existence’ are ‘direct.’ ” <em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">Id.</a> </em>“Quantity [refers to] those acts which are ‘so continuous and sufficient to be general or habitual.’ ” <em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">Id.</a> </em>Here, Restaurant’s main purpose is not to sell gift certificates, but to sell food in its establishment.

In <em>Purcell v. Bryn Mawr Hospital, </em>the plaintiff argued that venue over a Montgomery County hospital was proper in Philadelphia County because, among other things, the hospital purchased hospital supplies in Philadelphia. <em>See Purcell, </em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">579 A.2d at 1283, 1284</a>. In holding that venue in Philadelphia County was improper, our Supreme Court stated: “[W]e find it to be patently evident that the mere purchase of hospital supplies from Philadelphia merchants cannot form a satisfactory rationale for conferring venue.” <em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/525/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="579 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="1823727" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0237-01">at 1287</a>. More recently, in <em>Masel v. Glassman, </em>we found venue improper in a county where the defendant’s only activity there was the purchase of goods “for the furtherance of its business.” <em>Masel, </em><a href="/a2d/689/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="689 A.2d 314" data-case-ids="11924461,11979090" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0314-01,/pa-super/456/0041-01">689 A.2d at 317-18</a>. Consequently, Restaurant’s purchase of <a id="p1126" href="#p1126" data-label="1126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1126</a>goods in Philadelphia County does not constitute regularly conducting business.
