Haley, Jr., her long-time friend, expressed his interest in purchasing her Eastern Promenade residence. Plummer declined his invitation to sell. During their weekly visits in 1983 and 1984, Plummer and Haley generally discussed several other offers to Plummer to purchase her residence. Although Haley often reiterated his interest in purchasing Plummer’s home, she refused all offers to sell. In April 1985, Haley had his attorney draft a contract giving himself a right of first refusal to purchase Plummer’s residence. Haley presented it to Plummer, and they filled in the blanks on the agreement. Plum-mer set the selling price at $100,000 and required that Haley provide a $100 down payment. Ultimately, however, Plummer did not sign that agreement.</p>

Contrary to the position of the beneficiaries at oral argument, the preemptive right is not unreasonable simply because Haley is not bound to retain the property as his own residence. Although some testimony may have suggested that Plummer arranged the preemptive right with the expectation that Haley and his family would live in her home, the Probate Court did not find that the purpose of the agreement was to have Haley and his family live in the residence. In any event, the agreement with Haley gave Plummer more control over the disposition of her residence than simply allowing the residence to be disposed of by the beneficiaries.</p>
