All five appellants essentially testified that, upon Harvey’s return from Florida, he left the items at issue in their residences. Two appellants, John Pudish and Scheideler, testified that they started to sell some of these items on eBay at Harvey’s suggestion and with his help.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> All five appellants stated at one point that Harvey was either the owner of the property or that it was stolen.

Martel testified that Harvey told him that he was getting a divorce and brought the items with him from Florida. Martel stated his belief that, even though the property was in his possession, he considered it to be Harvey’s personal belongings. N.T. at 102. Trooper Warner testified that Martel even tried to turn over a big screen television, apparently believing that it must have been part of the investigation as well. N.T. at 28.</p>

The district attorney sought an order granting permission to give certain items to a local church organization and to destroy the rest.

The court further noted that, to the contrary, appellants either voluntarily brought the property to the police barracks or assisted the PSP in identifying the property sought in the criminal investigation of Harvey.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> It compared appel<a id="p693" href="#p693" data-label="693" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*693</a>lants’ respective mindsets at the time of the property’s removal to their modified positions at the subsequent hearing, and observed that there are three or four “people who [didn’t] want any part of this property until today.”</p>

Finally, having found appellants failed to meet their burden, the court stated that it was not necessary to reach the issue of whether the items at issue were contraband or derivative contraband.</p>

Asserting that “all possession of anything is lawful unless it is declared unlawful by some valid law,” Brief at 11, they maintain that it was up to the Commonwealth to prove that their possession was <em>unlawful. </em>To that end, they contend that the Commonwealth failed to produce any evidence that the property was contraband or stolen. They also maintain that the court erroneously held them to an ownership standard when all that Rule 588 requires is lawful possession.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> They assert that their readiness to cooperate with the PSP should not be held against them and that the court’s comment regarding their lack of written proof of ownership was unfair, given the fact that no one gets a receipt at venues such as lawn sales.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

It maintains that all appellants established at the hearing was that they held personal property on behalf of Harvey. Further, it contends that appellants’ readiness and failure to exhibit any possessory interest when turning over Harvey’s property to the PSP evidenced their belief that their possession was not lawful.</p>

While it is true that appellants were in possession of the property at the time of removal, they were unable to prove the <em>lawful </em>possession required under Rule 588. In the first place, John Pudish’s testimony that he and Harvey purchased some of the items was clearly discredited by common pleas, and credibility determinations are the sole <a id="p694" href="#p694" data-label="694" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*694</a>province of that court. With respect to the others, we believe that the term “lawful possession” within the meaning of Rule 588 means some possessory interest recognized by law, not mere physical possession in the absence of personal wrongdoing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Here, except for the organ characterized by Shirley Harvey as a gift, appellants did not assert any personal property right in the items. Rather, the evidence reflects that all the property was given to appellants by Harvey to hold on his behalf. In other words, they were bailees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Appellants presented no evidence whatsoever that Harvey lawfully possessed the items he left in their care. Indeed, appellants’ testimony was permeated with expressions of doubt that Harvey acquired the property legally. For example, John Pudish related his incredulity that Harvey had the wherewithal to purchase many of the items that he brought up from Florida in a forty-foot U-Haul truck. N.T. at 78, 84.

N.T. at 65.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Thus common pleas properly found that appellants simply failed to meet the burden imposed upon them by Rule 588.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

A “bailment” has been defined as “delivery of personal property to another, who accepts possession of the property, and exercises custody and control over it.” <em>Riggs v. Dep’t of Transp., </em>76 Pa.Cmwlth. 227, <a href="/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%201219" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="463 A.2d 1219">463 A.2d 1219</a>, 1220 (Pa.Cmwlth.1983). We need not here decide whether mere bailees can acquire the sort of possessory interest required by Rule 588. In this regard, the trial court opined, "Although we have found that claimants have no ownership interest in the subject personal properly, if we had found that Carl Harvey lawfully owned such property, we would agree that only the Estate of Carl Harvey, if there were such an entity, would have standing to now claim the subject property.” Common pleas op. at 2.</p>

While holding that appellants failed to prove lawful possession, we emphasize that we do not in any way suggest that appellants’ behavior was unlawful. Indeed, their conduct appears to have been entirely blameless, and they fully cooperated with the authorities when contacted.</p>
