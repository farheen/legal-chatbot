Thus, she argues, the Board’s ruling that the shooting did not cause her disability was not supported by substantial evidence because the govern<a id="p991" href="#p991" data-label="991" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*991</a>ment failed to present any evidence that she would not have continued to function as a police officer but for the gunshot wound and the resulting post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

Her disorders included extreme anxiety and depression, “bad nerves,” sleeplessness, tension headaches, chaotic home life, and patterns of irresponsibility. One psychologist who examined Croskey in 1981 reported:</p>

[and] moderately high for hypochondriasis, hysteria, schizoid features, and hypomania.” The results indicated “that she has a tendency to exaggerate physical complaints and to have hysterical reactions.” Another psychologist diagnosed Croskey in 1984 as suffering from borderline personality disorder, reporting that she had serious impairment in several ego functions including the management of high level anxiety and aggressive impulses. Further testing and interviewing by the same psychologist after the shooting “indicate[d] the presence of pre-existing severe character pathology.” Another psychologist testified that there was a relationship between Croskey’s preexisting personality situation and the way Croskey reacted to stress. Thus, the evidence presented to the Board described a person who was already laboring under severe emotional problems at the time of the on-duty shooting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

According to one medical report, the shooting incident “appears to have tipped the balance in Officer Croskey’s already precarious psychological functioning.” Noting that the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder “tend to be most prevalent in individuals with pre-existing psychopathology,” the report found that Croskey met all the criteria. Another psychologist, agreeing with this assessment, testified that “the personality disorder makes her more vulnerable to breaking down under the particular stress that we have. It is an underlying condition.” He further testified that the post-traumatic stress disorder “made the previous underlying [borderline personality] problem worse, yes. The post-traumatic stress disorder is new, yes. It followed the stress — it was in a sense an <em>exaggeration </em>of the underlying personality disorder.

Rather, he testified that he supposed that it is true that Croskey “could have or should have recovered more quickly from the shooting incident or not suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder” if it were not for the underlying personality disorder.</p>

The Board’s conclusion that Croskey’s disability “was not caused by the performance of her duties,” <em>ante </em>at [990], can be valid only if the Board found, by reference to record evidence, that her disability was an aggravation of her preexisting borderline personality disorder. At best the Board’s finding to that effect is implicit; it is nowhere stated as such.</p>
    <p id="b1058-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.12",1058,[1030,335,755,518]]]'>The Board accordingly has disregarded the requirement of <em>Citizens Ass’n of Georgetown, Inc. v.

I would accordingly remand the record for more explicit findings on the relationship between Croskey’s borderline personality disorder and her post-traumatic stress disorder. Respectfully, therefore, I dissent.</p>
