Accordingly, the WCJ issued an interlocutory opinion deeming the facts alleged in the Claim Petition admitted.

This job required him to work at remote job sites until the job was completed or until Employer told him to go to another location. However, Claimant would also work at Employer’s place of business in Philadelphia. Employer would often tell him the night before where to report for work the next day. Employer did not reimburse Claimant for any of his travel expenses nor did it provide any kind of transportation. On the day of his automobile accident on May 20, 1997, he had been working at the Acme job site since May 9, 1997 and was car-pooling there with two other employees. These three employees shared expenses by taking turns driving. Employer did not require that Claimant participate in the car-pool. However, Employer did inform employees who lived near each other that they would be working at the same location so they would have the opportunity to car-pool with other employees.

Therefore, this Court concluded that the claimant did have a fixed place of employment. Also, because the employer did not reimburse the claimant for his travel expenses nor was travel part of his contract for employment, none of the other exceptions to the going and coming rule applied.

The employees would meet at his residence, leaving their personal vehicles, and proceed to the job in company-authorized vehicles. At the job site, the employees traveled to and from the site in vehicles owned by another employee. In addition, the employer paid for the gasoline used by the vehicles traveling to and from the job site and also paid for the employees’ lodging during the work week.

Also, the driver and the claimant did not share the expenses because the employer reimbursed the driver for mileage. Moreover, the drivers terms of employment provided for transportation to and from work, thus making the trip to and from work not in furtherance of his own affairs but in the course and scope of his employment.

As such, this ease is distinguishable from <em>Empire Kosher Poultry. </em>Therefore, pursuant to Section 3 of the Ridesharing Act, Employer would not be hable for any injury sustained by Claimant while carpooling to and from work. Consequently, Claimant cannot use the car-pool arrangement as a basis for asserting that he was furthering the business of Employer or that he was on a special assignment for Employer while participating in the carpool.
