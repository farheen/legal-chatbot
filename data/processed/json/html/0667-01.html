The defendant, Gerardo Cardona (defendant), was convicted by a jury in the Superior Court of two counts of domestic assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 (simple assault or battery) and § 12-29-5 (disposition of domestic violence cases), against his wife, Catherine Cardona (Catherine), and Catherine’s son, Bernard Baton (Bernard).

That evening, the South Kingstown Police Department received a report of a domestic disturbance and dispatched several officers to a home on Broad Rock Road, where defendant lived with Catherine and Bernard, who was twenty-eight years old at the time and is developmentally disabled. Upon arrival, several officers questioned Catherine and memorialized her answers in a witness statement. Catherine reported that she saw her husband hit her son in the face and, when he fell to the ground, defendant kicked him. She also informed the officers that when she went into the house to call the police, defendant followed her; he was swearing at her, and he attempted to slap the telephone out of her hand. After she told the officers that she wanted defendant arrested and charged, Catherine signed both pages of her witness statement. A no-contact order was issued the next day that prohibited defendant from having any contact with Catherine or Bernard. The defendant, having been convicted of domestic assault on two prior occasions, was charged by criminal information with two counts of felony domestic assault. However, during the time between defendant’s arrest and the trial, Catherine’s resolve wavered.</p>

After <a id="p671" href="#p671" data-label="671" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*671</a>calling for her husband and son to quiet down, Catherine moved to the right side of the pool, which afforded her a view of what was transpiring in the front of the house. Catherine first testified that she saw the arms of both men “flying in the air,” but she then clarified that “[i]t looked like my husband was hitting my son.” Catherine also testified that she went into the house at a “fast-paced walk” to call the police, but admitted that she might have told the police that she “ran” for the phone. She stated that her husband followed her, “tapping [her] arm,” swearing at her, and calling her names while attempting to explain that nothing happened and, according to Catherine, to stop her from calling the police.</p>

Catherine also told the officer that she no longer wanted defendant in her home. Officer Young testified that although Bernard did not verbally respond to his questions, when asked if defendant had struck him, Bernard nodded, lifted his shirt to show his lower torso, and pointed to his reddened left cheek.</p>

He recalled that Catherine and Bernard were both visibly upset; he described Catherine as “flushed,” “fidgety,” “shaky,” and “having trouble communicating.” Bernard had “a red mark” on the left side of his face, and he was pacing continuously. The officer testified that Catherine gave a statement, and he recorded it for her because she was too nervous to write it herself. According to Officer Clarke, Catherine told them that she saw her husband strike her son and that when she ran into the house to call the police, defendant followed her, “slapping at her hand” and calling her names.

The jury affirmatively answered four separate questions on the verdict form: defendant committed domestic assault on Bernard, domestic battery on Bernard, domestic assault on Catherine, and domestic battery on Catherine. The defendant moved for a new trial and argued that the state’s case rested on Catherine’s prior inconsistent statement, which, he contended, was insufficient evidence to support the criminal <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>conviction. The trial justice denied the motion, concluding that in addition to the prior inconsistent statement there was other credible evidence to support the jury’s verdict. The defendant was sentenced to five years in the Adult Correctional Institutions — one year to serve on each count to run concurrently, the balance suspended, with probation. The judgment of conviction was entered on September 7, 2006.

First, he contends that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the assault of Catherine and his motion for a new trial with respect to both counts in the criminal information because the verdict rested on Catherine’s prior inconsistent statement which alone was insufficient evidence as a matter of law. Second, defendant argues that in charging the jury, the trial justice erroneously omitted an instruction that surmise, suspicion, or a hunch alone is insufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by instructing the jury on assault and battery because the criminal information only charged him with assault.</p>
