Our feeling as to this is strengthened by the fact that it appears that claim 8 differs from the alloAved claims in two particulars, viz: (a) That appellant conducts his method so as to absorb the nicotine in the first instance in a less concentrated acid and finally in a stronger acid, “using- the second acid for initial absorption Avhen the desired amount of nicotine has been absorbed in the first acid,” and (b) “the use of the countercurrent principle of absorbing the nicotine in the finely divided current of acid called for by the alloAved claims.”</p>
