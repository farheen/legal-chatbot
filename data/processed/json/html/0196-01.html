Brown, deceased, recovered a judgment at March term, 1856, of Bibb Inferior Court, against Norfleet P. Parker, for the sum of $140 98, principal, besides interest and cost, upon which judgment a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued on the 10th of April, 1856. The defendant in <em>fi.fa. </em>having removed to the county of Twiggs, John Rutherford, Esq., the attorney of the plaintiff, caused the <em>fi.fa. </em>to be placed in the hands of John Railey, the sheriff of Twiggs county, with instructions to make the money due thereon.</p>

L. Harden, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of T. A. Brown, had a final settlement, in which Rutherford accounted to said administrator for the amount of the <em>fi.fa. </em>collected by Railey, the sheriff, and took from the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>a receipt, which, after stating <em>thefi.fa., </em>recited, that “upon a final settlement with said administrator with said Ruthátford, attorney and agent of said estate, the said Rutherford had accounted for the amount of <em>said fi.fa. </em>as above stated. It appearing that John Railey, as sheriff of Twiggs county, collected the amount due on said <em>fi. fa., </em>in August, 1856, and it not being yet shown that either said sheriff or said Rutherford has paid over the money to the estate, now this is to show that if it shall hereafter appear that said money, or any part of it, has been paid over to the former representative of the estate, or to myself, then I am to refund the sum so paid back to said Rutherford.”</p>
