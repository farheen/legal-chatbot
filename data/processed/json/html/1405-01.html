These claims were rejected over the combination of Meyer et al. (I) in view of Meyer et al. (II), previously discussed. The examiner there took the position that the claimed compounds were homologous to those described in Meyer et al. (I) and therefore at least prima facie obvious due to the close structural similarity. He was sustained on appeal to the board, which also stated its belief, citing the closing sentences in example 5 of Meyer et al. (I) (also discussed previously), that that reference “substantially anticipates the claims on appeal.” Affidavit evidence submitted by appellants, showing that the compounds prepared according to their process were significantly better as optical brighteners for polyester fibers than compounds disclosed in the references and made by the process described therein, was dismissed by the examiner as being apparently based only on purity differences, which he held to be “irrelevant to patentability as claimed”. The board indicated that any evidence would be incapable to “render patentable a compound which is clearly lacking in novelty.”</p>

The cited references indicate that the broad class to which that compound belongs was known to the art prior to appellants’ discovery. Those references also suggest that the art would expect the class of compounds as a whole to possess the general property of optical fluorescence and that the art would have been able to prepare the specific compound of the claim. It further seems reasonable to accept that a chemist would ordinarily attempt to synthesize a compound in as pure a state as possible and disclose such a synthesis when called to do so. Thus having no reason to believe from the reference disclosures that the compounds therein described were not any less pure than appellants’, it follows that the general teachings contained therein, coupled with the specific disclosure of homologous compounds and the suggestion that methyl-ation at the 5,5' site on the benzene rings would have been Obvious to the artisan, make out a strong prima facie case that the claimed subject matter is unpatentable under 35 USC103.</p>
    <p id="b731-5" data-blocks='[["BL_731.5",731,[52,1305,1327,848]]]'>On the other hand, appellants have satisfactorily demonstrated not only that the prior art compounds were not comparable in purity to theirs, but also that such compounds even when so pure possess a significant (although admittedly very specific) property to a substantially lesser degree. Proof of the former has the effect of weakening the Patent Office case since, as we have indicated, that the prior art compounds be presumed pure is an important element of the logic behind the Patent Office position. Both aspects of the evidence, when taken together, have the effect of justifying an inference that the manifest difference in properties of the claimed subject matter over the prior art compounds would have been unexpected. Considering the record before us in light of the above, we are satisfied that appellants have rebutted the initial inference of obviousness and have established that their claimed subject matter, <em>as a </em>whole, would not have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in this art. Cf., <em>In re Doyle, </em><a href="/ccpa/51-2/0993-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="51 C.C.P.A. 993" data-case-ids="6092038" data-case-paths="/ccpa/51-2/0993-01">51 CCPA 993</a>, <a href="/f2d/327/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="327 F.2d 513" data-case-ids="121026,6092038" data-case-paths="/f2d/327/0513-01,/ccpa/51-2/0993-01">327 F. 2d 513</a>, <a href="/ccpa/51-2/0993-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="51 C.C.P.A. 993" data-case-ids="6092038" data-case-paths="/ccpa/51-2/0993-01">140 USPQ 421</a> (1964).</p>

Those cases all had to do with attempts at proving unobviousness with regard to <em>subject matter </em>of relatively broad scope with evidence pertaining to only a relatively narrow portion of such subject matter. <a id="p1410" href="#p1410" data-label="1410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1410</a>Here we are dealing with evidence pertaining to tibe full extent of subject matter being claimed. The mere fact that such, evidence deals with only one of a spectrum of properties possessed by that subject matter does not detract from its relevance. As we alluded to earlier, such evidence tends to prove that the subject matter claimed possesses a difference in properties over that with which it was compared which would have been unexpected. As such it is relevant and, we feel, convincing of un'obviousness.</p>

Of course, such considerations have no relevancy in a determination of patentability under 35 USC 103 and, needless  to say, we are not permitted to render any decision on issues not properly before us. We are left simply to ponder why such a rejection was not made.</p>
