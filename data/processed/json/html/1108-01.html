Harvey, then 46 years old, provided beer to numerous teenagers at his residence. Further, he required them to stay overnight at his home if they consumed any alcohol. Several minors testified that Harvey also provided them with marijuana. This activity continued until January 1992. In addition, one minor testified that, on two occasions Harvey asked him to sleep in his bed, and that Harvey sexually assaulted him on both occasions. Following a jury trial, Harvey was convicted of nine counts of selling or furnishing liquor or malt or brewed beverages to a minor, sixteen counts of corruption of minors, two counts of indecent assault, two counts of possession of a controlled substance (marijuana), and two counts of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance (mar<a id="p1110" href="#p1110" data-label="1110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1110</a>ijuana).

In that case, a minor appealed his adjudication of wardship following a trial court’s finding that he illegally sniffed an intoxicating substance. At the hearing, a police officer read into evidence a portion of the label that appeared on a tube of glue confiscated from the minor. The label stated that the tube contained the ingredient Toluol, and it carried warnings not to breathe the vapors. <em>Id. </em>at 874, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Ill.%20Dec.%2020" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="71 Ill.

While the court agreed that such evidence constituted hearsay, it found that an exception existed. First, the court reasoned that the notation on the label, as a statement by the manufacturer as to the contents of the product, “was an assertion of fact by an out-of-court declarant, offered in court by the State, to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e. that the glue contained Toluol.” <em>Id. </em>at 875, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Ill.%20Dec.%2020" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="71 Ill.

The phlebotomist also testified that the needle and vacutainer used to draw the appellant’s blood were packaged and labeled as “sterile.” On appeal, the appellant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the results of his blood analysis because the phle-botomist’s testimony establishing that he followed the required procedures in drawing appellant’s blood was based upon inadmissible hearsay.
