In July of 1994, Appellant confessed judgment against Appellees in the amount of $471,-716.71. One month later, in September, Appellees tendered a sum representing payment in full of all obligations owed the bank. At that time, Appellees requested that the judgment be satisfied of record.

On May 2, 1997, Appellees were notified that the remaining security instruments would be satisfied in the near future. The instant action was filed on May 28, 1997.</p>

In fact, there are two: whether the trial court erred in refusing to conclude that Appellees’ action to recover liquidated damages was time barred by the two year statute of limitations, and whether a mandatory satisfaction requirement even arose where Appellees allegedly failed to pay the required fee. We will address these in reverse order.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[226,1191,753,1131]]]'>¶ 8 Appellant argues that judgment on the pleadings was error as a factual dispute exists concerning Appellees’ payment of the required filing fee for the satisfaction. However, at no time pri- or to the filing of Appellees’ suit was the absence of the fee ever mentioned. In <em>First Nat’l. Consumer Discount Co. v. Fetherman, </em><a href="/pa/515/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="515 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1806004" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0085-01">515 Pa. 85</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="515 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1806004" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0085-01">527 A.2d 100</a> (1987), the bank, in answer to the mortgagor’s request for satisfaction, wrote that an order was being filed. Our Supreme Court found that response sufficient to waive the mortgagor’s failure to tender a filing fee. Appellant here in fact recorded satisfaction of the judgment and then sent a letter anticipating satisfaction of the remaining instruments. Its actions assume either that the fee was actually paid, or that Appellant waived the fee and thus the issue. In either event no dispute exists, and the matter warrants no further examination.</p>

According to § 682, the fine for neglecting to satisfy a mortgage applies “for every such offense,” if after “request and tender [of] reasonable charges” the mortgage fails to “make acknowledgement” pursuant to § 681, that <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>the mortgage has been paid off. The rules of statutory construction require that all of the provisions of a statute be given force, and they be interpreted in a way which does not lead to a ludicrous result. 1 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1921(a), 1922(1). Here, we are compelled to conclude that any limitation on the mortgagor’s ability to file suit for damages does not become activated until all refusals to fulfill the duty of recording satisfaction have been made, that is, until the satisfaction has actually been entered. Thus we agree with the trial court’s finding that this statute places no restrictions on renewal of a demand for entry of the satisfaction, and that, accordingly, the limitations period began to run anew whenever a request for satisfaction is made, whether an initial request or a subsequent one. Moreover, the penalty may be applied to each occasion on which the bank refuses to perform.</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[223,1369,752,1388]]]'>¶ 13 Our Supreme Court has opined that where a judgment creditor has received a written request for satisfaction and tender of the filing fee from a judgment creditor, a duty arises to have the judgment marked satisfied. <em>First Nat’l Consumer Discount, supra. </em>In other words, having once satisfied the notice and fee requirements, “the debtor is automatically entitled to liquidated damages calculated in accordance with the statutory formula.” <em>Key Savings &amp; Loan v. Louis John, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/379/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="379 Pa.

The obligation of the judgment creditor is thus not extinguished by the lapse of time, <em>Priester v. Milleman, </em><a href="/pa-super/161/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="161 Pa. Super. 507" data-case-ids="461307" data-case-paths="/pa-super/161/0507-01">161 Pa.Super. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20540" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="55 A.2d 540">55 A.2d 540</a> (1947), and, in fact, repeated requests here failed to move Appellant to perform its statutorily prescribed function. What is extinguished by § 8104, and by § 9404 is the remedy. Section 682, however, leaves the judgment debtor’s right to compensation intact, renewing the injury, and the penalty each time the mortgagee refuses to perform the statutorily delegated duty.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[1022,245,759,1481]]]'>¶ 14 The circumstances which compel this conclusion are not unique; an analogue has long existed with partial payment made on an existing debt. The general rule is that each time such a payment is made, the statute of limitations is tolled, because payment acknowledges the debt as an obligation from which the law necessarily implies a promise to pay. <em>Barnes v. Pickett Hardware Co., </em><a href="/pa/203/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="203 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="994687" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0570-01">203 Pa. 570</a>, 572, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.%20378" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="53 A. 378">53 A. 378</a>, 379 (1902). <em>See also Citicorp North America, Inc. v. Thornton, </em><a href="/a2d/707/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="707 A.2d 536" data-case-ids="11857009" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0536-01">707 A.2d 536</a> (Pa.Super.1998). The mortgagor’s statutory duty to demand and pay for satisfaction to be entered is equivalent to the debtor’s acknowledgement of his obligation on the debt. Although the analogue is not perfect since the debtor’s performance of his duty to pay is the inverse of the mortgagee’s refusal to perform, the notion that the statute may be started and stopped by the performance or refusal to perform some obligatory action nevertheless applies. Here, however, because the trial court’s award of damages was made on the basis of a statutory formula from 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 8104, which does not apply, the amount of liquidated damages must be revisited. Accordingly, for that limited purpose we remand to the trial court.</p>
