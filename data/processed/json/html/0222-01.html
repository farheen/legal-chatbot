We hold that, in the use of the expression “asserting any claim under this Act” in 39 M.R.S.A., § 111, the Legislature was referring to any right conferred by the Workers’ Compensation Act on the employee, and not merely to the voicing of a demand for benefits by petition or otherwise. In reaching this conclusion, we are merely carrying out the legislative direction to construe the provisions of the Act liberally. As a result, we achieve a harmonious consistency in our interpretation of sections 111 and 112. Also, by rejecting the literal and narrow meaning of the word “claim” for the broad sense of “right” in section 111, we maintain uniformity of purpose in the Legislature’s statutory scheme of proscribing unlawful employment discrimination under the Maine Human Rights Act and the Workers’ Compensation Act. Both serve to protect the rights of the handicapped individual in the person of an industrial injured employee.</p>

The review of Delano’s work capacity was initiated by the Director shortly after Delano had refused the assignment to the “wing man” position on the snow plow in late 1975. The Director suspected Delano of being a malingerer. The initiation of the investigation of petitioner’s medical condition was directed at finding a basis for demoting him. The demotion was intended to make petitioner’s employment with the City of South Portland less lucrative and thus secure his resignation. The medical reports received from the treating physician were stale. There was hearsay evidence that the Director at some indefinite time had stated that he would get rid of the petitioner entirely if he had more authority.</p>

There is no evidence in the record respecting the City’s qualification requirements in relation to either the job classification of Equipment Operator II or Laborer I. No attempt was made to show that the City in the past had treated other injured municipal employees differently from the action taken in Delano’s case. Delano testified that he had seen his doctor three times in late 1975. A letter from the doctor dated October 23, 1975 to the petitioner’s attorney states that Delano’s condition had reached an end result and that his diagnosis suggested that Delano had suffered a 10% permanent loss of physical function of his left leg. Delano’s supervisor, Arvin Erskine, testified that shortly prior to the change of classification in early 1976 the Director had received a letter from the doctor saying that because of his leg injury Delano could not operate heavy equipment. The conclusory testimony to the effect that the Director considered Delano a malingerer came from the petitioner himself as a self-serving statement without factual support or sustenta-tive explanation.</p>
