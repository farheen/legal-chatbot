Revenues earned from those December sales, however, are not included in test-year revenues at all. Narragansett defers revenue recognition for these sales until the January following the close of the test year.

This three-day lag period created a negative balance of $193,000 in Narragansett’s working-capital account, which balance the commission properly accepted.

Such expense has arisen since Narragansett previously had taken accelerated depreciation on particular assets in calculating its federal income tax expense. The present effect of this prior acceleration has been to create an excess of book depreciation over tax depreciation upon the same assets.

Narragansett would thus calculate its annual interest deduction in a manner virtually identical to the commission’s except in one refepect — it would completely exclude from its rate base any amounts representing funds supplied by investment tax credits. The result of this exclusion is plain; the same multiplicand representing rate base employed in the commission’s interest equation must be reduced by the total investment tax credit amounts available in Narragansett’s interest equation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The investment tax credit operates to reduce federal income taxes by allowing credits for amounts that a utility invests in new plant and equipment. For those investments, the utility takes a credit known as an Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credit (ADITC), the amount of which is measured by a statutory percentage of the investment in new qualifying facilities during the tax year. As previously indicated, the objective of the credit is to stimulate utility companies’ investment in new plants and equipment, thereby increasing employment, productivity, and general economic activity. <em>See NEPCO Municipal Rate Committee v.

This results in diminishing the company’s allowed expenses and, consequently, diminishing its revenue requirements. This process is rationalized by suggesting that this result causes a sharing of the tax credit advantage between the utility and the ratepayers. <em>See, e.g., NEPCO Municipal Rate Committee v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>668 F.2d at 1377-38; <em>Union Electric Co. v.

The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine has followed this hypothetical imputation of interest in <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v.

The Court of Appeals of North Carolina has strongly disagreed with this position in <em>State Utilities Commission v. Carolina Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em><a href="/nc-app/61/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="61 N.C.

The North Carolina Court of Appeals suggests that the interpretation of the federal courts ignores the requirement of the IRS regulation that no accounting treatment should be given to such credits in any way other than as though they were “ ‘capital supplied by common shareholders.’ ” <em><a href="/citations/?q=300%20S.E.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="300 S.E.2d 395">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/citations/?q=300%20S.E.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="300 S.E.2d 395">300 S.E.2d at 400-01</a>. Viewing these credits as capital supplied by common shareholders would, of course, preclude an assignment to such capital of a hypothetical interest rate as though it constituted borrowed funds. Although I believe that the North Carolina Court of Appeals has given a well-reasoned opinion in the interpretation of Treas.Reg. § 1.46-6(b)(3)(ii), I cannot fault the majority for being persuaded that interpretations by federal courts of appeal of United States Treasury Regulations are entitled to great weight.</p>

The principal witness who testified on behalf of the division in favor of ascribing hypothetical interest to ADITC was James A. Rothschild. When asked for his rationale to persuade the commission to depart from its prior decision on this precise issue in docket No. 1499, the witness did no more than quote from the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in <em>NEPCO Municipal Rate Committee v.

The sounder <a id="p1389" href="#p1389" data-label="1389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1389</a>policy would be to allow the utility the deduction for its actual apportioned income tax liability.
