Here, Appellant’s constitutional claims were not mentioned in the 1925 statement, in which Appellant argued only that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the revocation because the sole evidence presented by the Commonwealth was inadmissible hearsay. This statement was simply not sufficient to alert the trial court that Appellant was raising substantive due process and confrontation clause claims. Thus, the trial court did not address those claims in its opinion. Therefore, these arguments are waived. However, this does not end our inquiry. An examination of Appellant’s brief demonstrates that he does argue the evidence was not sufficient because it was an inadmissible hearsay claim raised in his 1925 statement and addressed by the trial court in its opinion. Accordingly, we will address that claim on the merits.</p>

Trial Court Opinion dated 7/14/08 at 2-3. The trial court found that this evidence demonstrated that Appellant and his family, “engaged in a continual and prolonged course of threats and abuse against the victim by calling her, driving by her house, appearing at her place of employment.
