Specifically, the panel found that appellant had committed the misconduct charged in Count IV, which alleged:</p>
    <blockquote id="b663-8" data-blocks='[["BL_663.7",663,[216,1397,1040,259]]]'>During 1988, [appellant] paid referral fees to Harold Hall, a non-lawyer then employed at the Reno Orthopedic Clinic for referring clients with potential personal injury claims to [appellant’s] law office. [Appellant’s] actions were in violation of Supreme Court Rules (SCR) 187, 188.1, 196.3, 197 and 203.1.</blockquote>
    <p id="b663-9" data-blocks='[["BL_663.8",663,[132,1695,1124,213]]]'>Bar counsel’s case against appellant consisted primarily of the testimony of two of appellant’s former legal secretaries, Muriel Skelly and Jan Marie Stellmach, and of various items of documentary evidence. The pertinent evidence adduced at the hearing is detailed below.</p>

She maintained appellant’s files and financial ledgers. She also wrote and signed checks. Skelly told the panel <a id="p1558" href="#p1558" data-label="1558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1558</a>that Harold Hall would telephone appellant’s office approximately once a week and would “give names of clients that he had told to get in touch with us.” When she conveyed Hall’s messages to appellant, appellant made no comments.</p>
    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[364,491,1121,441]]]'>Bar counsel asked Skelly if she had ever heard appellant state that Hall was compensated for referring clients to appellant. Skelly answered: “No.” Bar counsel also asked Skelly if Hall ever performed any investigative services, or asset checks with regard to appellant’s clients and cases. Skelly answered: “Not to my knowledge.” Skelly stated that she never saw Hall submit any bills to appellant’s office, and that she had received instructions from appellant that “A1 over at Business and Professional Collection Service would do any credit checks or asset checks that we needed because he was a client of ours.”</p>

      <em>Jan Marie Stellmach’s Testimony</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b664-7" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[365,1048,1122,260]]]'>Stellmach testified that she worked for appellant as a legal secretary from 1987 until January 1989. She stated that she left appellant’s employ because “someone told me . . . that he was being investigated by the Bar Association.” She further stated, however, that she did not “have a grudge against Mr. Drakulich.”</p>
    <p id="b664-8" data-blocks='[["BL_664.7",664,[367,1321,1120,175]]]'>In addition to clerical duties at appellant’s office, Stellmach testified that she was responsible for bookkeeping, including the maintenance of the ledger sheets. Eventually, appellant also authorized her to write and sign checks.</p>
    <p id="b664-9" data-blocks='[["BL_664.8",664,[366,1502,1124,539]]]'>Stellmach came to know Harold Hall as a result of his telephone calls and visits to appellant’s office. Although she was unable to confirm exactly when appellant made the remark, Stellmach testified that appellant told her that “Mr. Hall was at that time office manager of a group of orthopedic physicians and that he referred cases over and he in turn got a ten percent referral fee.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Stellmach said that she never saw any bills submitted by Hall for investigative services or asset checks, and like Skelly, Stellmach was only able to testify that she had no knowledge of Hall ever performing asset checks or investigative services for appellant. She also testified that appellant used a collection agency to perform asset checks.</p>
    <p id="b664-10" data-blocks='[["BL_664.9",664,[366,2054,1121,86]],["BL_665.1",665,[129,292,1122,211]]]'>Stellmach identified various items of documentary evidence introduced by bar counsel, including checks made out to Hall <a id="p1559" href="#p1559" data-label="1559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1559</a>drawn on appellant’s account and ledger entries from appellant’s office files. This documentary evidence related to three cases involving clients that Hall had referred to appellant’s office: (1) the “Griffey/Sabatini” case; (2) the “Colfer” case; and (3) the “Neff” case.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[130,518,1126,769]]]'>In the Griffey/Sabatini matter, a personal injury case, Stellmach identified a check drawn on appellant’s account made payable to Hall in the amount of $616.74. The check was signed by Stellmach, and contained a notation that it was payment for “investigative services.” Stellmach testified that she wrote the check at appellant’s direction, that appellant instructed her to make the notation “investigative services” on any checks made payable to Hall, and that the amount of the check was ten percent of the fee appellant earned in the case. Stellmach also identified a client ledger entry from appellant’s office files verifying that the amount of the check was exactly ten percent of appellant’s fees, that the check was drawn on appellant’s general account, and that, unlike payments made to other investigators employed by appellant, the payment to Hall was not charged as “costs” to the clients in any way. In other words, as Stellmach confirmed, the payments to Hall came out of appellant’s pocket and were not charged to the client.</p>
    <p id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[133,1294,1127,859]]]'>In the Colfer case, a case involving a suit against a local nightclub, Stellmach identified two checks drawn on appellant’s account made payable to Hall in the total amount of $575.00. One of the checks was in the amount of $275.00 and was signed by appellant after Stellmach left appellant’s employ. It contains a notation indicating that it was payment for an “asset check” of the nightclub involved. The other check, written to Hall in the amount of $300.00, was written and signed by Stellmach before she left appellant’s office. This check contains the notation, “Colfer-investigative services.” Stellmach testified that appellant told her that Hall “would be given a ten percent referral fee on that [the Colfer] case.” Stellmach also identified a notation which she entered in the office ledger sheets corresponding to the $300.00 check. The notation states, “deduct $300 from fees.” Stellmach explained that the payment to Hall in the Colfer case was made prior to the final settlement in that matter because Hall had “called the office some — minimum of half dozen times saying that his kids would have no Christmas if he wasn’t advanced money.”</p>
    <p id="b665-7" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[138,2160,1123,176]],["BL_666.1",666,[355,289,1118,83]]]'>Stellmach further identified a check drawn on appellant’s general account made payable to Hall in the amount of $500.00. The check contains the notation: “legal assistance Kelly Neff.” She stated that the check was written out by her, but signed by <a id="p1560" href="#p1560" data-label="1560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1560</a>appellant. She verified from the ledger sheets that appellant’s attorney’s fees in the Neff case were $5,500.00.</p>

      <em>Appellant’s Testimony</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[354,483,1121,255]]]'>In response to Stellmach’s testimony, appellant testified that he never had any agreement whatsoever with Hall to pay him any part of the fees appellant earned in cases that Hall referred to appellant. Rather, any payments to Hall were for investigative services, asset checks and other work that Hall performed in the cases at issue.</p>
    <p id="b666-5" data-blocks='[["BL_666.6",666,[353,754,1124,528]]]'>Appellant explained that he has known Hall ever since appellant was about 10 years old. In his late teens, Hall was involved in a serious car accident which left him with neurological damage. As a result, Hall became a “different sort of person” who had difficulty remembering, in moving about, and in maintaining jobs. Hall worked for a time collecting overdue bills at the Reno Orthopedic Clinic. At one point during this period, Hall experienced financial difficulties and needed extra money for his wife and children. When Hall expressed a desire to become an investigator, appellant explained that it was not as easy as it seemed. Nonetheless, appellant told Hall he would try to find extra work for him.</p>
    <p id="b666-6" data-blocks='[["BL_666.7",666,[355,1298,1122,673]]]'>Thereafter, Hall referred Kelly Neff to appellant. Neff was a personal friend of Hall’s and had been injured in an automobile accident. At appellant’s request, Hall obtained medical bills and records relating to Neff’s injuries and a copy of the police accident report. When Neff experienced problems in obtaining medical treatment because of a lack of insurance, Hall was helpful in finding a specialist to treat Neff. Hall also ran a check on the personal assets of the woman who was responsible for the accident, and was helpful in keeping track of Neff and in updating him on the progress of the case. Appellant testified that he believed the $500.00 he paid Hall was reasonable for the work that Hall did in the case. Appellant also explained that he represented a passenger referred to him by Hall who was injured in the car along with Neff. Hall received no payments with respect to that case, however, because Hall performed no work in that case.</p>
    <p id="b666-7" data-blocks='[["BL_666.8",666,[354,1977,1122,402]],["BL_667.1",667,[121,291,1123,357]]]'>Similarly, appellant testified that the payment Hall received relating to the Griffey/Sabatini matter was simply a payment for work that Hall performed and not part of a fee-splitting, or referral fee arrangement. As with Neff, Hall was personally acquainted with Sabatini, who was the brother of Hall’s boss at the Reno Orthopedic Clinic. Hall referred Sabatini to appellant when he was injured by a drunk driver, and appellant agreed to represent Sabatini and the Griffeys who were injured in the same accident. In exploring a possible claim for punitive damages, <a id="p1561" href="#p1561" data-label="1561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1561</a>appellant requested Hall to run an asset check on the driver responsible for the accident. Also, because Sabatini changed jobs frequently and the Griffeys moved to California, Hall proved to be a “good liaison” and was useful in getting interrogatories, discovery responses, and other information from them. After the case was settled, Hall and appellant negotiated a payment of ten percent of appellant’s fee for the work Hall did on behalf of Gail Griffey and Sabatini.</p>
    <p id="b667-5" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[121,656,1129,587]]]'>Appellant further explained that Craig Colfer was the stepson of Hall’s sister. Hall referred Colfer to appellant when Colfer was involved in an altercation at a local nightclub. Appellant stated that he used Hall to keep in touch with Colfer while the case was pending, to investigate the extent of any prior such incidents at the nightclub, and to run an asset check on the nightclub in contemplation of proceedings to execute on the judgment that appellant ultimately obtained in Coffer’s favor. In December of 1988, after a favorable verdict was obtained, but before formal judgment was entered, appellant advanced Hall $300.00 for the work he had performed because Hall said he needed funds so he could give his kids a decent Christmas. Later, Hall performed the above-noted asset check and was paid an additional $275.00.</p>
    <p id="b667-6" data-blocks='[["BL_667.5",667,[127,1248,1124,494]]]'>Explaining why he’did not charge Hall’s services to the clients, appellant testified that “a lot of it was basically finding work for Harold to do, and also assisting my office in things that my normal staff would have to do, contacting a client, making contact with them, making sure that he got answers to interrogatories . . . .” Appellant found work for Hall to do because he was Hall’s friend, because Hall had “difficulty with one of his kids medically,” and because Hall had problems maintaining a job. Appellant insisted that Hall was only paid for services performed and did not receive any remuneration in other cases he referred to appellant where Hall did not perform work.</p>
    <p id="b667-7" data-blocks='[["BL_667.6",667,[128,1749,1123,75]]]'>Appellant also explained why Hall never submitted any written bills for his services:</p>
    <blockquote id="b667-8" data-blocks='[["BL_667.7",667,[212,1855,1041,496]]]'>Mr. Hall was not a licensed — in fact, Mr. Hall told me he wanted to become an investigator. The only way that I could really have Harold do anything for my cases, other than people he would know and that he would be able to contact, he would have to either be employed by my office, which I didn’t want to do, or he would have to go ahead and go formally with another investigative agency. And that just wasn’t in the ballpark for Harold Hall. And he wasn’t — he didn’t have a secretary, and I’m not going to have my secretary type his bills. It was just a thing of this is what I had done type of transaction.</blockquote>
    <p id="b668-4" data-blocks='[["BL_668.3",668,[361,298,1121,170]]]'>
      <a id="p1562" href="#p1562" data-label="1562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1562</a>Appellant directly contradicted Skelly’s testimony that he used Business and Professionals Collection agency to perform asset checks. Appellant flatly denied ever using that company to conduct an asset check.</p>
    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.4",668,[362,480,1121,356]]]'>Appellant further testified that both Skelly and Stellmach left appellant’s office under less than amicable circumstances. According to appellant, Skelly was disappointed when appellant informed her that she would not be employed as an attorney in appellant’s office after she obtained her license to practice. Additionally, “hard feelings” resulted from a number of problems, one of which involved alleged incidents in which she provided legal advice to appellant’s clients.</p>
    <p id="b668-6" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[363,842,1122,632]]]'>With respect to Stellmach, appellant testified that he “got extremely mad” when she left some gay literature (relating to the Gay Rodeo Association) in the office copy room. The literature was inadvertently stapled to some other papers which were then sent off to a client. Additionally, when appellant upbraided Stellmach for making “off-colored” comments and jokes in his office, Stellmach took offense and suggested that appellant “should be taken to the Equal Opportunity Employment . . . .” Stellmach resigned shortly thereafter when he refused to let her leave early on the Friday before New Year’s Eve. Appellant stated that Stellmach informed him that “because of. . . personal reasons and the pressures at the office, she was no longer going to work for me.” Later, when Stellmach made a claim for unemployment benefits, appellant “confronted her on it.”</p>
    <p id="b668-7" data-blocks='[["BL_668.6",668,[363,1479,1122,394]]]'>Appellant also called an attorney from a large personal injury firm in San Francisco to testify. The attorney testified that his firm often hires people to perform tasks similar to those which appellant claimed were provided by Hall. Further, the attorney stated that payments for such services “come out of the attorney’s fees themselves rather than the costs attributed the client. Our view and our practice is that if — if what we’re doing for the client is a lawyer-related activity, then we don’t charge that expense to the case costs.”</p>
    <p id="b668-8" data-blocks='[["BL_668.7",668,[365,1887,1121,175]]]'>Although Hall was present at the disciplinary proceedings, for reasons unclear from the record, neither appellant nor bar counsel called Hall to testify. On August 7, 1990, the panel filed its findings and recommendations. The panel found in pertinent part:</p>

This court indicated that after conducting “an independent review of the record” and after having “carefully considered the arguments of counsel,” the court had “determined that additional eviden-tiary proceedings before the hearing panel would assist the court in resolving the issues on appeal.” Specifically, this court directed the panel to conduct “a further evidentiary hearing for the purpose of receiving testimony from . . .

Hall testified at this hearing that he has <a id="p1564" href="#p1564" data-label="1564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1564</a>been extremely close to appellant and to appellant’s entire family for thirty years. Hall has worked many jobs, but, he indicated, his training has been primarily in the area of credit and collections. He testified that his father was a vice-president in a credit company and his father encouraged and assisted Hall in learning the credit collections business. His father taught him how to perform skip tracing, asset checks, and other aspects of credit collections business. Hall, however, has often been unemployed over the years. During such periods appellant would help him out by letting Hall do various odd jobs, including janitorial or gardening work.</p>

By her own admission, Skelly <em>was not even employed by appellant in 1988, </em>the relevant time period specifically alleged in the complaint. Count IV of the complaint alleged that appellant paid referral fees to Harold Hall “[d]uring 1988.” According to Skelly, however, she worked for appellant as a legal secretary and legal assistant for two and one-half years <em>beginning in April 1985. </em>Thus, Skelly’s own testimony establishes that she left appellant’s employ prior to 1988. Because she was no longer employed by appellant in 1988, Skelly could have had no knowledge resulting from her employment of any referral fee payments appellant allegedly made to Hall during 1988.</p>
    <p id="b674-8" data-blocks='[["BL_674.7",674,[350,1622,1120,267]]]'>Moreover, Skelly could only testify affirmatively that Hall telephoned appellant’s office to “give names of clients that he had told to get in touch with us.” This conduct alone does not constitute a violation of any of the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct, and, of course, appellant does not contest the fact that Hall referred clients to his office for representation.</p>

In this respect, Skelly could only state that she had <em>no knowledge </em>of whether Hall performed investigative or other services for appellant. That she <em>did not know </em>whether Hall ever performed an asset check or any type of investigative service is certainly understandable in light of the fact that she did not <a id="p1569" href="#p1569" data-label="1569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1569</a>even work for appellant during the time frame in issue. Moreover, Skelly <em>never heard </em>appellant say that Hall was paid a referral fee. Skelly’s lack of knowledge in these respects manifestly is not clear and convincing proof that Hall was paid solely for having referred clients to appellant; nor does it consist of clear and convincing proof refuting the evidence that appellant paid Hall for services Hall performed. Surely, such testimony cannot approximate clear and convincing proof that appellant engaged in the professional misconduct alleged in Count IV.</p>

In sum, Skelly’s testimony can hardly be said to constitute clear and convincing proof that appellant paid Hall referral fees during 1988.</p>

The fact that on occasion the payments to Hall equaled or approximated ten percent of appellant’s fee does not alter the essential nature of the payments or their purpose. The evidence suggests that appellant did not share a predetermined percentage of his legal fees with Hall, rather, appellant generally negotiated with Hall the value of Hall’s services after they were performed, and paid Hall for those services out of appellant’s own funds.

    <p id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[113,368,1122,258]]]'>It is true that the negotiations were conducted in terms with which Hall was familiar, <em>i. e., </em>Hall would always begin the negotiations with a request for thirty percent. He could not say, however, of what he was requesting thirty percent. Appellant was simply negotiating with Hall in terms with which Hall was familiar and able to understand.</p>
    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[115,641,1129,1133]]]'>Even if the payments to Hall could be construed as a violation of SCR 188(1), <em>i.e., </em>a percentage sharing of appellant’s fees, we are not persuaded that appellant’s conduct warrants the severe sanction recommended by the panel. We note, for example, that the alleged misconduct occurred prior to this court’s publication of an anonymous letter of reprimand clarifying that fee arrangements involving the percentage sharing of attorneys’ fees with non-lawyers are prohibited. <em>See </em>Discipline of an Anonymous Member of the Bar, Docket No. 22708 (Order, August 14, 1992). The attorney in that case was anonymously reprimanded for violating SCR 188(1). The attorney had paid a percentage portion of the attorney’s fees to an investigator in exchange for the investigator’s services. This court took the extraordinary step in that case of publishing an anonymous private reprimand because the state bar had specifically agreed that “[i]t is reported that similar fee arrangements are utilized by other local practitioners . . . .” Further, the state bar had represented to this court that publication would “inform other lawyers who are sharing fees with non-lawyers that this conduct is prohibited . . . .” Imposition of a 90-day suspension under the instant questionable circumstances occurring in 1988 would be wholly inconsistent with the far less harsh anonymous discipline issued by this court subsequently in August 1992. It would also be abhorrent to this court’s desire to encourage consistency in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions.</p>
    <p id="b677-6" data-blocks='[["BL_677.6",677,[120,1780,1122,402]]]'>Finally, we are not persuaded that the evidence in this record clearly and convincingly establishes a violation of SCR 203(1). That rule provides: “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.” We perceive no clear and convincing evidence supporting the panel’s finding that appellant violated any of the aforementioned rules of professional conduct or that he knowingly assisted or induced another to do so.</p>

Accordingly, we disapprove and reject the panel’s recommendations. Further, we vacate our prior order of August 7, 1990, directing the maintenance of confidentiality in this matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We are of the view, however, that clear and convincing evidence in this record establishes that appellant failed to make reasonable efforts to ensure that Hall’s conduct was compatible with appellant’s professional obligations. See SCR 187(2). This entire proceeding might have been avoided if appellant had simply made reasonable efforts to keep records and documentation specifying the exact nature of Hall’s services and the compensation he received. Moreover, appellant should have explained to Hall that appellant could not pay Hall for his services in amounts to be established by a predetermined percentage of appellant’s fees. Consequently, we conclude that pursuant to SCR 120(1), appellant shall be assessed all costs of the disciplinary proceeding, including, but not limited to, reporter’s fees, investigation fees, bar counsel and staff’s salaries, and witness expenses allocable to this proceeding.</p>

    <p id="AIL" data-blocks='[["BL_678.6",678,[573,1189,182,39]]]'>dissenting:</p>
    <p id="b678-5" data-blocks='[["BL_678.7",678,[358,1242,1120,484]]]'>I dissent from the majority because I find that clear and convincing evidence exists to support the panel’s findings that on several occasions Drakulich violated a number of the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct by splitting his attorney’s fees with Hall. Hall was employed by the Reno Orthopedic Clinic as a bill collector and had continual access to individuals injured in accidents. In reviewing this case <em>de novo, </em>the majority has chosen to accept Drakulich’s explanation of why and how payments were made to Hall. I, however, do not. Accordingly, I would support the panel’s recommendation to impose a ninety day suspension on Drakulich.</p>
    <p id="b678-6" data-blocks='[["BL_678.8",678,[356,1742,1121,358]],["BL_679.1",679,[107,294,1120,85]]]'>The majority concludes that clear and convincing evidence did not exist to support the finding of the board and chooses to reject the panel’s finding. Drakulich contends, and the majority apparently agrees, that his testimony was “completely uncontra-dicted.” I disagree. They base this primarily on Drakulich’s testimony that he never agreed to pay Hall any part of the fees he earned in cases that Hall referred to his office. Additionally, the majority focuses on Drakulich’s testimony that he did not charge <a id="p1573" href="#p1573" data-label="1573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1573</a>Hall’s services to the clients because “a lot of it was basically finding work for Harold to do.”</p>
    <p id="b679-5" data-blocks='[["BL_679.4",679,[109,385,1122,395]]]'>Drakulich also testified that Hall did not submit bills for his services because Hall was not a licensed investigator and stated that the only way he could have Hall do anything for his cases, “other than people he would know and that he would be able to contact, he would have to either be employed by my office, which I didn’t want to do, or he would have to go ahead and go formally with another investigative agency.” However, I believe that other evidence clearly shows that Drakulich was guilty of fee-splitting with Hall.</p>
    <p id="b679-6" data-blocks='[["BL_679.5",679,[112,795,1124,723]]]'>In the initial hearing, testimony from Muriel Skelly and Jan Marie Stellmach provided clear and convincing evidence of Drakulich’s fee-splitting with Hall. Both were secretaries for Drakulich at the time, and Skelly is now a member of the State Bar of Nevada. Skelly testified that once a week Hall would call the office to give the names of clients “he had told to get in touch with us.” She testified that, to her knowledge, Hall did not perform investigative services or asset checks for Drakulich and that she never saw bills submitted by Hall for such services. This indicates to me that Hall was being compensated for referrals rather than investigative services. Additionally, she testified that Drakulich told her that Business and Professional Collection services performed asset checks because they were a client. However, Drakulich flatly denied using Business and Professional Collection agency to perform asset checks and had the owner of the agency testify to the same.</p>
    <p id="b679-7" data-blocks='[["BL_679.6",679,[117,1524,1126,530]]]'>Stellmach’s testimony also indicated that Hall received a share of attorney’s fees from Drakulich. Stellmach testified that she heard Drakulich say that Hall referred cases over and got a ten percent referral fee for those services. Stellmach testified that in the Griffey/Sabatini case, she wrote a check to Hall at Drakulich’s direction equaling ten percent of the fees Drakulich collected in the case. Stellmach’s testimony also indicated that Drakulich told her that Hall would be given a ten percent referral fee on the Colfer case, although the check given to Hall prior to final settlement indicated that it was for investigative services. In the Neff case, Hall was paid approximately nine percent of Drakulich’s fee.</p>
    <p id="b679-8" data-blocks='[["BL_679.7",679,[119,2067,1122,315]]]'>The majority argues that the fact that “on occasion the payments to Hall equaled or approximated ten percent of appellant’s fee does not alter the essential nature of the payments or their purpose.” I disagree. In light of the testimony of Skelly and Stellmach, this represents to me clear and convincing evidence that Hall was improperly receiving a percentage of Drakulich’s attorney’s fees.</p>
    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.3",680,[360,295,1120,575]]]'>
      <a id="p1574" href="#p1574" data-label="1574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1574</a>Stellmach also testified that to her knowledge, Hall never performed the type of investigative services that Drakulich claims he performed. However, all checks to Hall, Drakulich told Stellmach, were to include the notation, “investigative services.” Investigative services performed by other entities were recorded in the “costs advanced column” of the ledger and eventually charged against the client. However, Stellmach indicated that payments to Hall were treated differently. Payments were not recorded as a cost advance and were not charged against the client but instead were deducted from Drakulich’s attorney’s fees and came directly out of Drakulich’s pocket. Additionally, Stellmach never saw any bills submitted by Hall for investigative services.</p>
    <p id="b680-5" data-blocks='[["BL_680.4",680,[359,884,1121,315]]]'>Hall’s testimony also fails to persuade me that Drakulich was not splitting fees with him. Hall rambled extensively in his testimony and had difficulty in answering questions. Although Hall denied referring clients to Drakulich for a fee, insisting that references were only because Drakulich was a family friend and a good attorney, I find that his testimony was largely unhelpful and unpersuasive in confirming Drakulich’s testimony.</p>
    <p id="b680-6" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[358,1203,1125,767]]]'>Finally, I note my concern with the law relating to our review of bar matters. The law regarding bar matters is clear. “Though persuasive, the Board’s findings and recommendations are not binding on this court. This court must review the record de novo and exercise its independent judgment to determine whether and what type of discipline is warranted.” In re Stuhff, <a href="/nev/108/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="108 Nev. 629" data-case-ids="8558257" data-case-paths="/nev/108/0629-01">108 Nev. 629</a>, 633, <a href="/nev/108/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="108 Nev. 629" data-case-ids="8558257" data-case-paths="/nev/108/0629-01">837 P.2d 853</a>, 855 (1992). The panel was the body which actually observed the witnesses testify. I would, therefore, change the law to grant more deference to the disciplinary board, especially in the area of witness credibility. <em>See, e.g., </em>Matter of Arrick, <a href="/ariz/180/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="882 P.2d 943" data-case-ids="1464214" data-case-paths="/ariz/180/0136-01">882 P.2d 943</a>, 948 (Ariz. 1994) (“[o]n issues of witness credibility, we have held that it is proper for the commission and this court to defer to the hearing committee”). Because Drakulich disputed the testimony of his former secretaries, much of the board’s decision turned on witness credibility. The disciplinary panel, not this court, is the body best able to view the testimony of the various witnesses and assess their credibility.</p>
