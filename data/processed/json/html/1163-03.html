He ultimately abandoned his car and continued to flee on foot. The officer pursued in his patrol car, yelling for him to stop. After appellee was apprehended, the officer retraced appellee’s route and found several bags containing cocaine and marijuana near appellee’s car.

In <em>Stewart, </em>a uniformed police officer responding to a domestic disturbance call approached the defendant’s vehicle at an intersection. The officer drew his gun, as it was reported the defendant was armed, and ordered him to turn the car off and place his hands on the dashboard; instead, the defendant drove off. The court held the defendant submitted to a show of authority when the officer approached with his gun drawn, even though the defendant drove away; this momentary submission caused the court to conclude the defendant was seized, and the escape conviction was upheld.</p>

The facts leading to appellee’s arrest, the Superior Court held, did not include a similar “momentary period” and accordingly, found appellee was never detained. <em><a href="/a2d/939/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="939 A.2d 359" data-case-ids="8301950" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0359-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/939/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="939 A.2d 359" data-case-ids="8301950" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0359-01">at 363</a>.</p>

The Superior Court noted, “Only when the police have restrained the liberty of a person by show of authority or physical force may we conclude that a seizure has occurred.” <em><a href="/a2d/939/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="939 A.2d 359" data-case-ids="8301950" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0359-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/939/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="939 A.2d 359" data-case-ids="8301950" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0359-01">at 362</a>.

      <a id="p1165" href="#p1165" data-label="1165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1165</a>First, there is the statement the officer did not “suggest” to appellee that he was detained. When a police car activates lights and sirens behind “a reasonable person,” that is a definite and unmistakable “show of authority” that is to be obeyed— it is not a mere suggestion for one’s consideration, but an unequivocal statement of authority and a demand to stop. It may not be as dramatic as displaying a gun, but this is a manifest, undeniable, universally recognized show of authority and intention — indeed, flight is positively indicative of appellee’s recognition of that authority, and of his decision to decline to honor it. For the Superior Court’s theory to be correct, one must find that “lights and siren” is something less than a “show of authority,” and I cannot so conclude. To affirm such a notion is a mistake.</p>
