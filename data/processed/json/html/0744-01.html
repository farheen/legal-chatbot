In November 1993, hearings were held before an ALJ. The ALJ made the following findings of fact.</p>

A service wire owned by West Penn extended from its transformer to a weatherhead which was located on a meter pole on Poorbaugh’s farm. Poorbaugh owned the meter pole and the facilities thereon, except for the meter. Electrical service wires extended from the meter pole to Poor-baugh’s barn. West Penn did not own or maintain these service wires.

As a result of the storm, the subtransmission line and the distribution circuit came into contact with each other. Electricity going to Poorbaugh’s farm was interrupted. Following the creation of an overcurrent along the 12.5 kV distribution circuit, three protection/control devices (reclosers) failed. These reclosers were located on the same distribution line that serviced Poorbaugh’s barn.</p>

He also saw insulation falling off of the electrical lines which ran from the pole next to the house to the barn. The barn was completely destroyed by the fire. The barn fire was not caused by smoking, accelerants, chemicals, spontaneous combustion of hay, lightning or milking equipment.</p>

The transformer removed from Poorbaugh’s farm was manufactured in 1960. West Penn transformers of a certain vintage are considered to have core loss and are scrapped automatically. West Penn had no policy of examining transformers periodically to determine their age. In 1991, West Penn also had no program to test distribution lightning arresters located on transformers to determine whether they were functioning properly. The purpose of a lightning arres-ter on a transformer is to drain off high voltage coming through a line to the transformer.</p>

The PUC granted Poorbaugh’s exceptions to the following extent: (1) witness testimony gave rise to a finding that the transformer was damaged before the fire occurred at Poorbaugh’s farm; (2) a negative inference should have been drawn against West Penn for its failure to provide information about the number of line splices on the 25 kV subtransmission line, and the evidence suggested that there were multiple line splices on the 25 kV line as of June 16 and 17, 1991; (3) witness testimony showed that multiple line splices weakened the 25 kY line and predisposed it to break; and (4) West Penn did not provide reasonable service when it made multiple line splices to the 25 kV line since NESC guidelines state that splices should be avoided. The PUC denied the remainder of Poorbaugh’s exceptions.</p>
    <p id="b805-10" data-blocks='[["BL_805.11",805,[988,628,750,850]]]'>The PUC concluded that, while multiple line splices resulted in a weakening of the 25 kV line and predisposed it to break, the splices did not cause the line to break since no evidence was offered on this point. Moreover, while the transformer was damaged before the fire at Poorbaugh’s farm, the PUC did not conclusively find that the faulty transformer caused the fire. The PUC also concluded that West Penn did not have a duty to inspect the transformer because no evidence was put forward to rebut the contention that it is impossible to test transformers and arresters. The PUC adopted the initial decision of the ALJ as its own action to the extent that it was consistent with the PUC’s opinion and order.
