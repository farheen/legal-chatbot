Thereafter, the Township Supervisors acted extraordinarily fast. By letter dated August 13, the Township Secretary informed Lehigh Asphalt, in pertinent part, that: “The Board of Supervisors of East Penn Township, at their August 2, 1999 meeting rejected your Land Development Plan because it did not comply with the township’s Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.” Based on the lack of specificity as to the reasons for rejecting the plan, as required .under Section 508 of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 10508, Lehigh filed a complaint in mandamus on June 11, 2001, alleging deemed approval of the July 1999 plan.</p>

Thereafter, in accordance with Section 609.2 of the MPC<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>, the Supervisors enacted, on May 22, 2000, an amendment to the ordinance that provided for quarrying, mining and reclamation as a conditional use only in the Industrial Commercial District. Two days before the enactment of this amendment, Lehigh Asphalt submitted an application for a special exception pursuant to the original version of Section 1019. Thereafter, Lehigh Asphalt, while it awaited a decision from The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on the application for a permit to quarry the additional acreage, requested and obtained a series of continuances on the ZHB hearing on this application. Eventually, having put off the hearing for more than a year and still without a decision from DEP on the permit, the ZHB convened a hearing on June 19, 2001. At the second and final hearing on October 16, 2001, the ZHB denied the application on the ground that <a id="p1067" href="#p1067" data-label="1067" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1067</a>absent the DEP permit the special exception application was incomplete. Lehigh Asphalt’s counsel objected to this on the ground that, having accepted the application and proceeded with the hearing without first having received the DEP permit, the ZHB waived any right to dismiss the application on this ground and by implication agreed to make receipt of the permit a condition of special exception approval. On November 5, 2001, the ZHB issued a written decision denying the application based on the lack of a DEP permit. The ZHB explicitly declined to rule on whether Lehigh Asphalt had a right to proceed under the original Section 1019 or was subject to the amendment under the pending ordinance doctrine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Without formally consolidating the two actions, common pleas considered this zoning appeal in conjunction with the previously filed action in mandamus. Lehigh Asphalt asserted in the zoning appeal that it was entitled to special exception approval under the original Section 1019 and that the ZHB erred in cutting short the hearing and denying the application based on the absence of the DEP permit. In the mandamus action, Lehigh Asphalt avers that the Township treated the land use plans submitted in July of 1999 at the Zoning Officer’s request as a land development plan and, therefore, the Township was obligated to review those plans in accordance with Section 508 of the MPC. Lehigh further asserts that, inasmuch as the letter denying approval of the plans fails to specify the defects found in the application, describe the requirements that have not been met and cite to the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon, as required under Subsection 508(2), the plans are deemed approved under Subsection 508(3).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In the mandamus action, the Township filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, asserting that pursuant to the six-month statute of limitations in 42 Pa.C.S. § 5522(b), applicable to an action against an officer of a government unit, the complaint filed in June of 2001, more than a year after the plan denial in August of 1999, is untimely. On November 4, 2002, in a single order, common pleas denied Lehigh’s zoning appeal and dismissed the action in mandamus. Thereafter, on November 7, common pleas denied the Township’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that dismissal of the mandamus action rendered the motion moot. In a single opinion, common pleas explained its reasons for both decisions. Common pleas concluded that under the pending ordinance doctrine the amended version of Section 1019 applied, but in any event, even under the original version, Le-high’s application for ZHB approval was incomplete in the absence of the DEP permit and therefore properly denied. In addition, common pleas opined that, in the absence of the DEP permit, Lehigh did not have a clear right to relief in mandamus.</p>
    <p id="b1116-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1116.11",1116,[1009,269,752,1155]]]'>In the present appeal, Lehigh Asphalt argues that common pleas erred in denying relief in mandamus on the merits because the only matter before the court was the Township’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Lehigh Asphalt also reasserts the contention that the land use plans filed in July 1999 were land development plans, which triggered the decision requirements and deemed approval provision of Section 508. For this reason, Lehigh contends it is entitled to relief in mandamus compelling deemed approval of the plan. With respect to the appeal from the denial of its special exception application, Lehigh argues that inasmuch as the special exception approval would ultimately result in land development, review is subject to the original ordinance rather than the pending amendment pursuant to the pending ordinance doctrine in Section 917 of the MPC, added by the Act of June 23, 2000, P.L. 495, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 10917.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

C.S. § 5522(b). Section 5522(b) directs, in relevant part, that “[a]n action against any officer of any government unit for anything done in the execution of his office” must be commenced within six months. In support of their contention that Section 5522(b) applies, the Supervisors point to <em>Township of Bensalem v. Moore, </em>152 Pa.

In <em>Township of Bensalem, </em>we held that an action in mandamus by a police officer to compel job reinstatement must be against the municipal officers and once these individuals were joined in their official capacity the limitations period in Section 5522 applied to bar the claim. The present action is distinguishable in that the nature of the relief sought in <em>Township of Bensalem, i.e., </em>to compel the municipality to comply with the Police Tenure Act, required joinder of the appropriate township officials individually under Pa. R.C.P. No. 1094(a). Lehigh Asphalt properly asserted the present action not against individual Supervisors but against the Board of Supervisors as the governing body under Pa. R.C.P.

On appeal, common pleas ruled that the amended version of the Ordinance applied and affirmed the ZHB’s denial on the ground that Le-high failed to submit a DEP permit with the application.

In order to afford this opportunity, Section 609.2(3) precludes any landowner challenge to the validity of the original ordinance provision while the Township’s proposed curative provision is pending enactment. Thus, a municipality may avoid the harsh remedy sometimes imposed when a landowner prevails in a validity challenge or curative amendment application, <em>ie., </em>forced acceptance of a land use or development that the municipality considers undesirable or at odds with its comprehensive plan. <em>See </em>Section 1006-A(b)(c) of the MPC added by the Act of December 21, 1988, P.L. 1329, <em>as amended) </em>53 P.S. § 11006-A(b)(e). <em>See also Casey v.

In contrast, the procedures under Section 609.2 apply only after a determination by the municipality that an amendment is necessary to cure an invalidity in the ordinance rather than undertaken purely as a matter of legislative discretion. There is no principled reason that the shield under Section 917 should not equally apply to a zoning amendment under the procedures established in Section 609.2 for a municipal curative amendment and to an amendment pending pursuant to the procedures in Section 609. If we permitted such a distinction, a municipality could too easily avoid the effect of Section 917 by a simple unilateral declaration that the troublesome ordinance provision is invalid and thereby delay or prevent a landowner’s development without any determination by the ZHB or a court as to whether the particular ordinance provision actually suffers from some legal infirmity. This is not the intended purpose for the curative amendment process in Section 609.2 and we will not permit it as an unintended side effect. In the present case, where Lehigh does not seek to challenge the original ordinance provision but rather elects to rely upon it, Lehigh’s special exception application is shielded under Section 917 of the MPC from the effect of the pending amendment and the ZHB was obligated to review the application for compliance with the existing provision.</p>

Notably, Section 912.1 does not require the prior issuance of state permits before a ZHB decision on a special exception application. While the ordinance in this case directed the applicant to provide a copy of its DEP permit with the application materials submitted to the zoning officer, the ordinance did not direct that absent this document the zoning officer should not submit the application to the Planning Commission and ZHB for review.

Pursuant to the mineral lease executed in 1964, Huss Co. conducted some quarry operations on the west side of the road in the early 1970’s. Later, under a lease addendum granting additional mineral rights on the eastern portion of the property, Huss quarried approximately 5 acres on the east side of the road and creek. The east side quarry, known as the "Weirbach Quarry,” after the name of the landowner who preceded the Messinas, operated pursuant to a non-coal surface mining permit originally issued, in 1976, by the Department of Environmental • Resources [since renamed the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)]. Lehigh Asphalt agrees that operations at the Weirbach Quarry ceased for some period of time in the early 1990’s, a period in which Huss Co. sought and obtained DEP approval to temporarily cease activities but retain the permit.

It is important to note that, in general, reference to the "pending ordinance doctrine” has at least three manifestations and, in the proceedings leading up to this appeal, all three have been invoked at some point. First, the doctrine may apply to protect the municipality from the initiation of a use prior to the official enactment of a pending ordinance that will render that use non-conforming. <em>See Boron Oil Co. v.

This is the common law version of the doctrine, which was modified by the MPC. Second, the MPC establishes an exception to the common law rule, which operates to protect a landowner/applicant. <em>See generally Naylor v. Township of Hellam, </em><a href="/pa/565/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="565 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="124686" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0397-01">565 Pa. 397</a>, 407 n. 6, <a href="/a2d/773/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="773 A.2d 770" data-case-ids="11092079,124686" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0770-01,/pa/565/0397-01">773 A.2d 770</a>, 776 n. 6 (2001).

Third, Section 609.2(3), added by the Act of October 5, 1978, P.L. 1067, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 10609.2(3), protects the municipality from landowner curative amendments it may deem undesirable by providing that the municipality is not required to entertain a landowner’s curative amendment or an ordinance validity challenge if there is a relevant curative provision pending. <em>See Kaufman and Broad, Inc. v.

In their brief, the Supervisors argue that they really just rejected the application for being incomplete in some way. They point to the fact that on December 10, 1999 the Zoning Officer refunded to Lehigh $10.00 of the $300.00 fee paid with the July plan submission and stated that it “represents a refund of your fees for the zoning application submitted 7/14/99. The East Penn Planning Board determined that your submission at that time was incomplete. The Board of Supervisors confirmed that opinion and rejected the plan.” However, the Township’s admitted treatment of the July 1999 submission as an application for land development under Section 508 of the MPC takes this case outside of the circumstances described in <em>Gorton v. Silver Lake Township, </em>90 Pa.Cmwlth. 63, <a href="/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%2026" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="494 A.2d 26">494 A.2d 26</a> (1985), where the requirements of Section 508 were never triggered because the landowner did not submit a completed application. <em>Compare Gorton </em>at 27-28 <em>with Township of O'Hara v.

While Section 917 was added to the MPC as a part of the many amendments enacted in 2000, the shield it affords to landowners has been a part of the MPC since at least 1988 when Section 603(c)(2.1) provided the same protection.

East Norriton Township Zoning Hearing Board, </em><a href="/a2d/764/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="764 A.2d 98" data-case-ids="11160157" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/0098-01">764 A.2d 98</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2000) a panel of this court held that licensure by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Aviation (DOT) was a prerequisite to “any action by the [ZHB] on an application for a special exception to construct and operate a heliport.” <em><a href="/a2d/764/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="764 A.2d 98" data-case-ids="11160157" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/0098-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/764/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="764 A.2d 98" data-case-ids="11160157" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/0098-01">at 100</a>. The court based its decision predominantly on language in DOT’s regulations that the court deemed unequivocal support for the conclusion that licensure must be obtained before the ZHB can act on a special exception request. Inasmuch as neither the MPC nor prior decisions of this court require that agency permits be obtained prior to the ZHB's decision, the decision in <em>Maher </em>cannot be read as a general abrogation of the well-established premise that a special exception may be approved but becomes effective only after the issuance of prerequisite permits from state agencies. <em>See </em>Ryan, Pennsylvania Zoning Law and Practice, § 5.2.1 (2003). Insofar as the decision in <em>Maher </em>suggests a different rule, we consider that rule as limited to the particular land use and DOT regulations at issue in that case. <em>Maher </em>does not undermine our interpretation of the applicable ordinance provision in the present case.</p>

We reiterate that the ZHB must review the special exception application under the original version of Ordinance Section 1019. If the application is approved, no development in the form of land disturbance for increased quarry operations pursuant to either the special exception or the deemed approval of the development plans may occur unless and until DEP issues the requisite permit.</p>
