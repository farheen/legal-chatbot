Mr. Bivens immediately walked to the kitchen area of the lounge to order some food. Mr. Bivens and Appellant began arguing over money that had been lying on the floor. Mr. Bivens picked up the money, threw it in Appellant’s face and left the lounge. Thereafter, Appellant went into the kitchen, retrieved a knife and followed Mr. Bivens' out of the lounge.

In an amended PCRA petition, Mr. Begler raised the issue of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to raise a diminished capacity defense. After a hearing, the PCRA court found that Mr. Foreman had been ineffective for failing to raise a diminished capacity defense and granted Appellant a new trial.

Mr. Foreman testified at the evidentiary hearing that he knew that Appellant was the child of an incestuous rape and that he had several items of violent trauma in his immediate past before the incident, including having part of his ear bitten off and being stabbed. Had Mr. Foreman inquired or investigated the facts and circumstances of <a id="p1218" href="#p1218" data-label="1218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1218</a>Appellant’s situation, which included an attempted suicide and subsequent institutionalization, counsel could have used such information to present a diminished capacity defense. While Mr. Foreman presented a defense of self-defense, the theories of self-defense and diminished capacity are not mutually exclusive and could have been presented together. Thus, we find that the PCRA court did not err in finding that Mr. Foreman should have inquired of Appellant’s psychological makeup, and for this reason, we agree with the PCRA court that he had no reasonable basis for not presenting a diminished capacity defense.</p>

Justice Castille insinuates that allowing appellants to present claims of PCRA counsel's ineffectiveness on appeal to this Court subverts the PCRA's timeliness requirements by permitting the Court to consider "new claims” that were never presented in a timely PCRA petition. Neither the statutory language of the PCRA nor <em>Pursell, </em>however, support such an argument. The PCRA timeliness provisions simply do not speak in terms of claims, instead providing only that a petitioner must file a PCRA petition within one year of a judgment becoming final, as Appellant clearly did here. At the same time, <em>Pursell </em>did not in any way treat the appellant's claims of PCRA counsel's ineffectiveness as new claims that should have been presented in a separate PCRA petition but rather, consistent with this Court's precedent, treated such claims of ineffectiveness as ones being presented at the first available opportunity to do so. Although Justice Castille correctly notes that <em>Pursell </em>was not decided under the 1995 amendments, which added the timeliness requirements to the PCRA, we fail to see how these amendments serve to alter <em>Pursell’s </em>clear holding that this Court may properly review claims of PCRA counsel's ineffectiveness when it is an appellant's first, and quite possibly only, opportunity to do so. In fact, were this Court to adopt Justice Castille's logic, then it would seem that in situations where a <em>pro se </em>PCRA petitioner filed a petition on the 364th day of his judgment becoming final, and counsel was subsequently appointed and raised "new” claims in the amended PCRA, those claims would, according to Justice Castille's reasoning, run afoul of the PCRA's time-bar.</p>

In his concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Castille argues that Appellant's claim regarding the ineffectiveness of appellate and PCRA counsel is waived and quotes language from this Court’s decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bracey, </em><a href="/citations/?q=787%20A.2d%20344" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="787 A.2d 344">787 A.2d 344</a>, 350 n. 4 (Pa.2001) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Of course, the waiver language cited by Justice Castille dealt with claims that were presented in a significantly different fashion than the one at issue here. In <em>Bracey </em>and <em>AbdulSalaam, </em>the specific issues found waived by the Court were ones that the respective appellant had presented as claims of straight trial court error or prosecu-torial misconduct — as if still on direct appeal — and were not framed as claims of counsel’s ineffectiveness. Rather, at the end of these particular claims, Bracey and Abdul Salaam merely tacked on a bald statement that all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise and/or properly litigate the underlying claim, without ever attempting to apply or discuss the tripartite standard governing ineffectiveness claims. It was in this context that the Court concluded that "such an undeveloped argument, which fails to meaningfully discuss and apply the standard governing the review of ineffectiveness claims, simply does not satisfy Appellant's burden of establishing that he is entitled to any relief." <em>Bracey, </em><a href="/citations/?q=787%20A.2d%20344" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="787 A.2d 344">787 A.2d at </a>350 n. 4; <em>Abdul-Salaam, </em><a href="/citations/?q=786%20A.2d%20974" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="786 A.2d 974">786 A.2d at </a>977 n. 3. The Court in <em>Bracey, </em>however, did address the merits of claims presented in the same manner as the issue considered by the Court today. Like the claims reviewed by the Court in <em>Bracey, </em>the claim at issue here is not presented as if Appellant is still on direct appeal, i.e. asking this Court to consider a clearly waived claim of straight trial court error. Rather, the claim is not only presented and discussed as one of counsel’s ineffectiveness, with the three prongs of the ineffectiveness standard applied to the claim as it relates to trial counsel, but is properly-layered, taking into account that previous counsel could have raised the issue of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness but failed to do so. This Court has previously found, indeed in <em>Bracey </em>itself, that such a claim is sufficiently developed so as to warrant review. <em>See, e.g., Bracey, </em><a href="/citations/?q=787%20A.2d%20344" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="787 A.2d 344">787 A.2d at 351-357</a> (reviewing numerous claims where appellant's discussion section addresses each prong of the ineffectiveness standard as it relates to trial counsel and at least includes a properly-layered assertion that all prior appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to <a id="p1219" href="#p1219" data-label="1219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1219</a>raise trial counsel's ineffectiveness). The circumstances in <em>Abdul-Salaam, </em>of course, were different than those in either <em>Bracey </em>or the instant matter as Abdul-Salaam’s trial counsel was also his counsel for purposes of direct appeal, thereby removing any need to layer any ineffectiveness claims presented. Unlike the waived claims discussed above, which Abdul-Salaam presented as straight claims of error, this Court did address the merits of Abdul-Salaam’s claim that was framed as one of ineffectiveness and which addressed each prong of the ineffectiveness standard as it related to trial counsel. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=786%20A.2d%20974" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="786 A.2d 974">786 A.2d at 977-979</a>. Clearly, then, the Court in <em>Bracey </em>and <em>Abdul-Salaam </em>considered the merits of issues framed in the same manner as the issue considered here and therefore, despite Justice Castille's assertions to the contrary, neither Bracey nor Abdul-Salaam received disparate treatment from this Court and would have no basis to argue otherwise.</p>

Rather than presenting a specific diagnosis and describing the nature and degree of an associated cognitive impairment, the focus of Dr. Levit’s testimony was directed more generally to rendering an opinion on the ultimate legal question involved. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., March 19, 1998, at 8 (“I think that his capacity was significantly diminished to formulate any intent”), <em>id. </em>at 9 (“so I don’t think there was, from my perspective, the ability to commit a first degree murder”).</p>

Indeed, on cross-examination, the psychologist seemed to maintain a very broad perspective concerning the conditions that would support a diminished capacity defense under Pennsylvania law. <em>See </em>N.T., March 19, 1998, at 17 (“certainly when a person is violent when they are mentally ill or when they are under the influence of cocaine or <a id="p1220" href="#p1220" data-label="1220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1220</a>alcohol or what have you, I don’t think that this is the same kind of violence as a premeditated kind of thing”).

There is, perhaps, no more fundamental principle of Pennsylvania appellate jurisprudence. In addition to the fact that appellate courts are not equipped to determine the factual predicates that control many legal issues (such as whether counsel articulated a credible, reasonable basis for a challenged action or inaction), the requirement of issue preservation reaffirms that the main event in legal disputes is the trial of the matter. <em>Dilliplaine v.

Issue preservation also permits the trial judge to reconsider <a id="p1222" href="#p1222" data-label="1222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1222</a>and alter rulings thereby avoiding appeals, conserving precious judicial resources, and focusing those disputed legal issues that remain so as to make for better, more useful appellate guidance. Appellate courts are overburdened enough without permitting or encouraging new claims being raised upon appeal, much less upon discretionary appeal.

First, appellate courts will not be required to expend time and energy reviewing points on which no trial ruling has been made. Second, the trial court may promptly correct the asserted error. With the issue properly presented, the trial court is more likely to reach a satisfactory result, thus obviating the need for appellate review on this issue. Or if a new trial is necessary, it may be granted by the trial court without subjecting both the litigants and the courts to the expense and delay inherent in appellate review.

The petition filed in the PCRA court is now frozen in time, and yet the lead opinion would allow appellant to add, on allocatur no less, an entirely new substantive claim sounding not only in the Sixth Amendment, as his previous claim did, but a new layered claim impheating both the Sixth Amendment (governing direct appeal counsel) and our Criminal Rules (governing PCRA counsel).</p>

On this point, I would note that there is something to be said for a construction that would limit the petitioner to claims that were identified in his petition in a timely fashion, while, of course, permitting amendment to develop and support the timely-identified claims. Significantly, that is the approach the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has taken to the federal habeas statute of limitations. <em>See United States v.

Its <em>ad hoc </em>rule would allow certain criminal defendants to pursue upon alloca-tur claims that were <em>never </em>raised in the PCRA petition or on direct appeal, while consigning all other defendants to raise procedurally indistinguishable claims only by invoking the PCRA’s exceptions to the time-bar. That judicial rule, I respectfully submit, is a truly radical step in obvious tension with statutory, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b), and existing rules-based authority. Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(B). Moreover, this end-around the PCRA is even more arbitrary than was fundamental error review. The only PCRA petitioners who will share in this largesse are petitioners who are both fortunate enough to retain, or have appointed, new counsel for purposes of allocatur, and lucky enough to convince this Court to entertain their new claims. All other PCRA petitioners, who wish to assail then’ initial PCRA counsel, will be faced with the requirements of the statute — and, under our precedent, them claims of PCRA counsel ineffectiveness will likely be time-barred. <em>See Gamboa-Taylor, </em><a href="/a2d/753/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="753 A.2d 780" data-case-ids="11212841,225976" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0780-01,/pa/562/0070-01">753 A.2d at 785-86</a>.

In <em>Legg, </em>by contrast, trial counsel’s investigator had prepared a report which made reference to the appellant’s recent hospitalization and care under a “Dr. Dabney.” In point of fact, the appellant in that case was hospitalized a scant two months before the shooting, at which point she was suffering from “major depression” and was “actively homicidal and suicidal.” Trial counsel admitted that he knew that the appellant was experiencing anxiety and depression before her trial, but he attributed that to the fact of the impending trial, never pursuing the matter further. Trial counsel also “inexplicably” admitted that “he never reviewed” his investigator’s report.

For all this Court knows, direct appeal counsel in fact consulted with a psychiatrist who interviewed appellant and told counsel that there was no basis for a diminished capacity defense. Or, even assuming that there was a psychologist available to appellate counsel who would have offered in 1990 the “imperfect diminished capacity” opinion Dr. Levit testified to in 1998, direct appeal counsel may have reasonably determined, especially given the legal landscape before <em>Commonwealth v.

The PCRA petition in this case was filed before the 1995 amendments to the PCRA took effect in January, 1996 and, thus, is governed by the previous version of the Act. Although the time bar was enacted as part of the 1995 legislation, it is directly implicated here because the Court grants relief upon a claim that was never part of the PCRA petition. By permitting appellant to raise on allocatur an entirely new claim that should properly have been the subject of a serial PCRA petition, which would have been governed by the restrictions now set forth in § 9545(b), the time bar necessarily is implicated.</p>

I write separately to emphasize my disagreement with the assertion by the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, in footnote 3, that <em>Commonwealth v. Pursell, </em><a href="/pa/555/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="143" data-cite="555 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1701998" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0233-01">555 Pa. 233</a>, <a href="/a2d/724/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="724 A.2d 293" data-case-ids="11635848,1701998" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0293-01,/pa/555/0233-01">724 A.2d 293</a> (1999), requires this Court to treat Appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of post conviction counsel as ripe for review, even though presented for the first time in a petition for allowance of appeal. <em>Pursell </em>was an appeal from the dismissal of a timely post conviction petition in a capital case. Although we examined Pursell’s claims of ineffective assistance of PCRA counsel, that review occurred in the context of our mandatory appellate jurisdiction in PCRA capital cases. Mandatory capital PCRA appellate review implicates considerations that simply are not present in a petition for allowance of appeal, in a non-capital PCRA case, where it is within our discretion to accept or decline review. Consequently, I do not believe that our capital PCRA jurisprudence serves as a useful paradigm for resolving this problem within our system of discretionary review.</p>

This Court does a disservice to the allocatur process — the vehicle by which we set policy for the Commonwealth on “special and <a id="p1232" href="#p1232" data-label="1232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1232</a>important” matters — when we entertain claims for which there has been no prior appellate review.</p>
