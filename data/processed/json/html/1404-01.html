According to appellant:</p>
    <blockquote id="b744-15" data-blocks='[["BL_744.21",744,[223,1679,1324,623]]]'>Previous efforts to develop a solid, dense rubber having a high degree of softness by adding the various plasticizers to the rubber mix have not been successful in producing a dense rubber having the same degree of softness as sponge rubber. The principal difficulty along these lines has been that the production of a soft rubber requires the addition of such a large amount of plasticizer and softener that the material cannot be handled through the usual methods of extruding, molding, or calendering. Also, rubber softened with large quantities of plasticizer could heretofore be vulcanized only in a rigid mold or the like which maintains the article in the desired shape during the vulcanizing process. <em>Efforts to malee extruded articles out of prior art soft rubber compositions have not been successful because if the article has internal passages or openings or thin wall sections, it is not possible to support these parts of the article during vuleawimtion and the heat will cause the rubber to become so soft as to lose its original shape and collapse or distort to such a degree that the article after vuleawimtion has lost its shape. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>

When vulcanized in combination with rubber, the “soap” lost its plasticizing characteristics.
