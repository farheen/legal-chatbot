Appellee, Francis Matthew Dooris, Jr., was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of not less than three years nor more than ten years after a jury found him guilty of arson endangering persons <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and arson endangering property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The Superior Court in a memorandum opinion and order vacated the judgment of sentence and discharged appellee after finding that the circumstantial evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict. Specifically, the Superior Court found that the Commonwealth had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire in question was of incendiary origin and that appellee set the fire. I believe that the Superior Court erred in this conclusion in that the court departed from the accepted and usual course of appellate review and rendered a decision that is not in accord with precedent previously established by this Court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s determination that this appeal was improvidently granted.</p>

All that is required is that the circumstances proved should be such as reasonably and naturally justify an inference of the guilt of the accused, and of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence and satisfy the jury of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Nasuti, </em><a href="/pa/385/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="385 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1267075" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0436-01">385 Pa. 436</a>, 445, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20435" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="123 A.2d 435">123 A.2d 435</a>, 439 (1956). The Superior Court has previously observed that “it is clear that arson, by its very nature, is rarely committed in the presence of others, and a refusal to convict on circumstantial evidence alone would be tantamount to an invitation to commit the crime.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Although no direct evidence was pre: sented at trial that appellee was the one who set the fire, a host of compelling circumstantial evidence was presented implicating ap-pellee. Specifically, the Commonwealth presented evidence that: (1) appellee was the last individual to leave his place of business; (2) appellee had to cross through the storage area in route to exit the store after depositing the daily receipts in the safe; (3) the fire started less than one minute after appellee exited his place of business; (4) the alarm would not immediately signal a problem due to the delay setting; and, (5) appellee was experiencing serious personal and business financial difficulties. Although there was no direct evidence implicating that appellee committed the arson, I believe there was overwhelming circumstantial evidence presented which would allow a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee committed arson, especially when this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict winner. Further, the Superior Court memorandum contains numerous factual inaccuracies that are not sustained by the record. Specifically, the opinion states that the two testifying experts were not in agreement and that the one testifying expert referred to the other expert’s report as not the work of a good investigator. This statement is not accurate. The record shows that the two testifying experts were in total agreement with one another in all facets of the investigation. The reference to the poor investigative work was toward a third expert report. N.T. p. 103. This third report disagreed with the fire’s point of origin but agreed as to the incendiary nature of the fire.</p>
    <p id="b206-7" data-blocks='[["BL_206.7",206,[1001,2241,747,523]]]'>Next, the Superior Court also stated that no testimony was offered to explain what the actual cause of the fire was and why the alarm did not immediately pick up the fire upon being activated. Again, this statement is inaccurate as a Commonwealth expert concluded that the fire was set by open flame under the metal racks. Moreover, the Commonwealth offered the testimony of the alarm company’s owner to explain the delay mechanism incorporated into the alarm.</p>

This statement was merely speculation on behalf of appellant in his brief and, subsequently was incorporated into the Superior Court opinion. The record contains nothing to substantiate this allegation and, therefore, should not have been considered on appellate review.</p>
