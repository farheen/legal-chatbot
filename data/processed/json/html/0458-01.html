After realizing that the store to which he was headed would be closed by the time he arrived, and noticing that it had started to rain, Kirkwood jogged back towards home to go to another store located on the other side of his house. Upon reaching his home, he was confronted by both appellants. Appellant Johnson, with his hand inside his pocket, said to Kirk-wood, “Hand over your money, don’t fuck <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>with me, I’ll shoot you.” While Kirkwood searched through his pockets, appellant Harris also rifled through them, causing their hands to occasionally bump into each other. Johnson repeated his warning after Kirkwood indicated that he could not locate his wallet. When Kirkwood replied, “I don’t know what you want me to do, I can’t find my wallet,” Johnson revealed that he had been unarmed by removing his bare hand from his jacket pocket. Johnson then patted Kirkwood on the shoulder, said, “That’s okay, I was just fucking with you,” and started walking away. Kirk-wood turned to his left to leave, but saw Harris holding his wallet and going through its contents. Kirkwood then tried to wrestle the wallet away from Harris and the two of them fell to the ground, struggling.</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[169,1256,755,1031]]]'>At that moment, Kirkwood’s neighbor, Mark Leeper, a federal agent with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, came out of his house and heard Johnson threatening to “bust” Kirkwood. When Johnson saw a police car go by, he began running, with Leeper in close pursuit for several blocks. Johnson was eventually apprehended by Officer Patrick Cumba of the Metropolitan Police Department. Harris also attempted to flee, but was stopped by David Glendenning, another of Kirkwood’s neighbors and a special agent with the Department of Justice. Glenden-ning carried his gun, badge and a pair of handcuffs, which he used to detain Harris after Kirkwood stated to him that Harris had “just tried to rob [him].” When Officer Cumba arrived at the robbery scene with Johnson in tow, several neighbors identified Johnson as one of the robbers.</p>

Harris reacted by punching Kirkwood, who, in response, grabbed him. The two of them fell to the ground, at which point Kirkwood’s wallet fell out of his pocket. Harris testified that after he saw the wallet fall, he picked it up and tried to hand it back to Kirkwood, who promptly snatched the wallet away from him, and then called for help.

United States, </em><a href="/a2d/678/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="678 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="11737815" data-case-paths="/a2d/678/0556-01">678 A.2d 556</a>, 563 (D.C.1996) (citing Criminal JURY INSTRUCTIONS for the District of Columbia, No. 4.46 (4th ed.1993)). Appellants challenge primarily the sufficiency of the evidence presented on the “taking” elements of robbery, asserting that there was no evidence in the record indicating that the complainant’s wallet was taken from him by either appellant. Harris notes that the complainant, Scott Kirkwood, acknowledged on cross-examination that he did not see Harris take his wallet from him and did not know how Harris had obtained his wallet. Therefore, he argues that the government failed to establish that Kirkwood was dispossessed of his wallet by Harris. Unlike the cases cited by the appellants, <em>see United States v. McGill, </em><a href="/us-app-dc/159/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="159 U.S. App. D.C. 337" data-case-ids="3593587" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/159/0337-01">159 U.SApp. D.C. 337</a>, <a href="/f2d/487/1208-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="487 F.2d 1208" data-case-ids="217444,3593587" data-case-paths="/f2d/487/1208-01,/us-app-dc/159/0337-01">487 F.2d 1208</a> (1973); <em>Zanders, </em><a href="/a2d/678/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="678 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="11737815" data-case-paths="/a2d/678/0556-01">678 A.2d 556</a>, however, there was sufficient evidence presented from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant Harris had taken the victim’s wallet. First, Kirkwood testified that he was in possession of his wallet on his way to the store before he was approached by the appellants. Appellant Johnson, standing two or three feet away and pretending to hold a gun, threatened to shoot Kirkwood if he did not give him his wallet. While Kirkwood was going through his pockets to find his wallet, he felt appellant Harris likewise going through his pockets at the same time. Immediately after Kirkwood had indicated that he could not locate his wallet, and appellant Johnson had taken his finger out of his coat to show that he was just “kidding”, Kirkwood turned to find appellant Harris holding . his wallet and going through its contents. As the trial court noted in denying both appellants’ motions for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the government’s case-in-chief, “the jury [could] infer, ... from the victim’s testimony or the alleged victim’s testimony that he had his wallet on him when he went to the store and because [Harris] ended up with the wallet after he was going through his pockets, he took the wallet from his pockets. That would constitute a robbery from his pockets.... ”</p>

Thus, taking Kirkwood’s wallet from the ground, as opposed to Kirkwood’s person, does not defeat the robbery charge under the facts presented here. As the jury was instructed on an aiding and abetting theory, all of the acts committed by Harris could be imputed to Johnson. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-105 (aiding and abetting statute).</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/380/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="380 U.S. 343" data-case-ids="1525098" data-case-paths="/us/380/0343-01">380 U.S. 343</a>, 349-50, <a href="/us/380/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="380 U.S. 343" data-case-ids="1525098" data-case-paths="/us/380/0343-01">85 S.Ct. 1004</a>, <a href="/us/380/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="380 U.S. 343" data-case-ids="1525098" data-case-paths="/us/380/0343-01">13 L.Ed.2d 882</a> (1965))). That is the case here. We agree with the trial court’s observation that there was either a robbery, or no crime. That is because to convict appellants of the lesser-included offense of attempted robbery, D.C.Code § 22-2902, the jury would have to find that appellants had the specific intent to commit robbery and committed an overt act, beyond mere preparation, reasonably adapted to the commission of robbery. <em>See Robinson, supra, </em>note 3, 608 A.2d at 116. If the jury found these facts, however, it reasonably would also have had to convict of robbery as the only further fact necessary to establish the elements of robbery, that Harris took possession of Kirkwood’s property is undisputed. Once the jury found specific intent to rob, it could not have also found that Harris’ conceded possession of the wallet was innocent, or that he did not “take” it in the legal sense of the word. <em>See Zanders, </em><a href="/a2d/678/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="678 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="11737815" data-case-paths="/a2d/678/0556-01">678 A.2d at 563</a> (requiring taking of property from the actual possession of a person as an element of robbery); <em>Ulmer, </em><a href="/a2d/649/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="649 A.2d 295" data-case-ids="7866572" data-case-paths="/a2d/649/0295-01">649 A.2d at 298</a> (noting that element of taking of property from the person is satisfied “even though the property be unattached to” the person); <em>see also </em>CRIMINAL Jury Instructions op the District of Columbia No. 4.46 (4th Ed.1993) (“It is necessary that the defendant carried away the property after taking it, so as to deprive the complainant of its possession, but the least removal of the thing from its place can be enough to show carrying away.”). Conversely, if the jury found that appellants did not have the specific intent to steal, it would have to acquit of the greater robbery charge as well as of the lesser-included attempted robbery charge. Therefore, on the facts of this case, where it is undisputed that Harris picked up Kirkwood’s wallet, either from his pocket or after it fell on the ground, appellants<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> were not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction of attempted robbery because if the jury found the requisite intent to rob, the evidence would be sufficient to convict on the greater charge of robbery.</p>

Both appellants Harris and'Johnson were originally charged with armed robbery, D.C.Code §§ 22-2901, -3202, and appellant Johnson was additionally charged with one count of receiving stolen property, D.C.Code §§ 22-3832(a),-3832(c). The jury found both appellants guilty of armed robbery on March 14, 1997, but after receiving post-trial memo-randa concerning the sufficiency of the "while armed” element of the robbery charge, the trial court granted defense motions for judgment of acquittal as to the armed element, and entered a judgment of guilty for each appellant as to simple robbery.</p>

The government argues that we should review appellant Johnson’s claim of insufficiency only to correct "manifest error" or to prevent a "clear miscarriage of justice” because he never asked for a judgment of acquittal on the simple robbery count below. <em>See Abdulshakur v. District of Columbia, </em><a href="/a2d/589/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="589 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="11297003" data-case-paths="/a2d/589/1258-01">589 A.2d 1258</a>, 1264 (D.C.1991); <em>Richardson v.

However, this court has held that at least in some circumstances, an objection may be preserved when made by a co-defendant. <em>See (Kirk) Williams v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/382/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="382 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="7971549" data-case-paths="/a2d/382/0001-01">382 A.2d 1</a>, 7 n. 12 (D.C.1978). Thus, because the trial court record reveals clearly that co-defendant Harris did object to the sufficiency of the evidence presented for unarmed robbery, that the evidence presented was the same as to both co-defendants under an aiding and abetting theory, and that the trial court did fully consider the issue, we decline to apply the plain error standard to Johnson’s claim. <em>Cf. <a href="/a2d/382/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="382 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="7971549" data-case-paths="/a2d/382/0001-01">id.</a> </em>(reviewing appellant’s objection to the government’s introduction of "mug shots” for harmless error, instead of plain error, even though he did not make the objection at trial, where co-defendant's counsel "aired the appropriate objections” to allow court to consider issue).</p>

The elements of attempted robbery require that (1) the defendant committed an act which was "reasonably designed” to commit the crime of robbery; (2) at the time the act was committed, the defendant acted with the specific intent to commit the offense of robbery; and (3) the act went beyond mere preparation as the defendant came "dangerously close” to completing the crime of robbery. <em>See Robinson v.
