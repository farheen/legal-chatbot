It contends the <em>DeJesus per se </em>rule is inextricably linked to a jury’s balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances under Pennsylvania’s death penalty statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)-(e). The Commonwealth suggests prosecutors have not abused “send a message” remarks, which in non-capital cases are properly examined on a case-by-case basis, with the focus on whether the remarks deprived the defendant of a fair trial and impartial jury. The Commonwealth contends the remark asked “the jury to demonstrate <em>to Loenell Howze </em>that ‘he did the <a id="p1287" href="#p1287" data-label="1287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1287</a>right thing.’” Commonwealth’s Brief, at 29 (emphasis in original) (quoting N.T.

The Majority notes a distinction between “send a message” statements by prosecutors that address the facts of the case at hand or the defendant directly, which are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and statements that exhort the jury to “send a message” to the judicial system or the community at large, which exceed prosecu-torial license. <em>Id. </em>at 1286-88.

In the Majority’s view, a <em>per se </em>rule fits in the capital penalty context because the particular concerns and consequences of the death penalty inquiry must be shielded from “emotional appeals” that can “[upset] a death penalty jury’s unique task of weighing specific aggravating and mitigating circumstances.” <em><a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="860 A.2d 102" data-case-ids="1100728,9145847" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01,/a2d/860/0102-01">Id.</a> </em>By contrast, the Majority asserts, in “less emotional” non-capital cases, “evaluation of the allegedly offending statement may be done on a case-by-case basis.” <em><a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="860 A.2d 102" data-case-ids="1100728,9145847" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01,/a2d/860/0102-01">Id.</a></em>

But one aspect of a trial which is far more subject to rational control is the behavior of attorneys— officers of this Court whose professionalism is absolutely indispensable to the fair administration of justice in this Commonwealth. Lawyers have an obligation to be aware of, and to abide by, the law governing the conduct of the matters in which they are involved. This Court’s unambiguous directive in <em>Hall </em>was not aimed at the conduct of witnesses, or police officers, or jurors, or court staff, or judges: it was aimed directly at counsel. Moreover, it concerned a matter and stage of trial over which counsel have unique, indeed premeditated control: <em>i e., </em>what it is they intend to say to the jury.
