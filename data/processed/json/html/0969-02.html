Upon receipt of the report of Hoenisch’s conviction, the Bureau notified him that it was treating his North Carolina impaired driving conviction as “equivalent” to the Pennsylvania offense for driving under the influence (“DUI”), and that his operating privileges would be suspended for one year effective October 20, 1997. Hoenisch filed a statutory appeal of the suspension in the court of common pleas, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1550(a), asserting that, since the North Carolina impaired driving conviction was premised upon a blood alcohol content of .08 percent, which is substantially lower than the .10 percent required under the Pennsylvania statute for driving under the influence, the offenses were not equivalent. At the hearing, the Bureau offered into <a id="p971" href="#p971" data-label="971" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*971</a>evidence a packet of documents containing the official notice of suspension, a conviction report received from the licensing authority in North Carolina, and Hoenisch’s driving record.

Furthermore, the trial court observed that the law of DUI is rapidly evolving and that it is not uncommon for states to have slightly different minimum blood alcohol levels. In this respect, the court noted that the Compact addresses such variations by merely requiring that the language and offenses described in each sister state’s statutes be “substantially similar” rather than identical.</p>

The statute at issue in <em>McCurdy, </em>however, was amended in 1996 to incorporate what logically should be viewed as a separate offense, namely, the operation of a motor vehicle by a minor while the amount of alcohol by weight in the <em>blood is .02 </em>percent or more. <em>See 75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(4)(ii); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

By so structuring the general statutes to include separate offenses, however, various state legislatures have effectively foreclosed a unitary analysis, relegating the courts to focus upon the substantial similarity to the Compact of the particular aspect of the general statute pursuant to which the licensee was convicted in each individual case. In addition to complicating judicial review, this legislative practice would appear to be inimical to the administrative interest in standardizing and streamlining reporting practices to achieve consistency, accuracy, and completeness in identification for purposes of license suspension. <em>See generally </em>Drivers License Compact — Administrative Procedures Manual — 1990 § 3.1.4.2 (U.S. Dep't of Transp.).</p>
