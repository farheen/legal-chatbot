The <em>Kleinknecht </em>court concluded a college owed a duty to its student who died of cardiac arrest during a practice of the school's intercollegiate lacrosse team. The duty was based upon a special relationship derived from their recruitment of the student and the benefit they derived from his participation. Moreover, the court concluded the harm suffered by the student was foreseeable. It reasoned foreseeability as it relates to duty of care as opposed to proximate cause, means the likelihood of a general type of risk. Although under the circumstances, the specific risk of cardiac arrest may have been unforeseeable, it fell within the general class of life-threatening injury, the risk of which was foreseeable.</p>

Appellants’ brief at 29. They allege such a special relationship exists here predicated upon the fact L.W. was recruited for the fundraising effort from which appellees directly benefited. Appellants rely primarily on <em>Huddleston, supra, </em>for this contention. The existence of a special relationship, however, does not negate the requirement that the harm is foreseeable. In <em>Huddleston, </em>a surrogate mother filed wrongful death and survival actions against the infertility clinic based upon, <em>inter alia, </em>negligence, after the father who went through the clinic to bear the child, shook the child to death. Although the court found the clinic stood in a special relationship to its clients and the resulting children since it was “a business operating for the sole purpose of organizing and supervising the very delicate process of creating a child, which reaps handsome profits from such endeavor,” it specifically stated it must be held accountable for “the <em>foreseeable </em>risks of surrogacy.” <em>Huddle-ston, </em>at 460 (emphasis supplied). The <em>Huddleston </em>court relied upon <em>Kleinknecht, supra, </em>which concluded a college owed a duty to a student it had recruited to play lacrosse based upon a special relationship between the two, but went on to separately consider the issue of foreseeability of harm. Accordingly, whether a special relationship existed is inapposite if the harm suffered is not foreseeable.</p>

The officers allowed Joseph to leave first. Samantha, who was highly intoxicated, was eventually let go and allowed to walk home alone. She fell and was found at the bottom of an embankment. As a result of hypothermia, she suffers from permanent brain damage.

The Third Circuit declined to impose liability under a state-created danger theory. The court accepted the allegation that the perpetrator gained access to the school through a door which was propped open. The court noted, however, it was not the school that propped the door open, but contractors working on a school construction project. It found the school was unaware there was a mentally deranged person waiting outside to cause harm.
