    <p id="b821-5" data-blocks='[["BL_821.5",821,[159,478,753,362]]]'>Parker Huff (Huff) appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (trial court) dismissing his appeal from the 1992 audit of the Auditors of Half-moon Township (Auditors) and thus denying his request that surcharges be filed against Township Supervisors Karen Frantz and Michael Barr. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b821-6" data-blocks='[["BL_821.6",821,[160,870,754,978]]]'>Halfmoon Township (Township) is a township of the second class located in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Huff is a registered elector and taxpayer in the Township. Following the filing of the Auditors’ report for the 1992 fiscal year, Huff filed an appeal with the trial court, alleging that during the period of the audit, Frantz and Barr received hourly compensation in violation of Section 515 of The Second Class Township Code (Code).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Huff alleged that Frantz and Barr received compensation to which they were not entitled in the amount of $282.58 ($262.50 plus $20.08 social security contribution by the Township) and $76.70 ($71.25 plus $5.45 social security contribution by the Township), respectively. As such, Huff asserted that the Township suffered a loss, and the Auditors therefore should have surcharged Frantz and Barr with the amount of such loss.</p>
    <p id="b821-7" data-blocks='[["BL_821.7",821,[162,1878,753,371]],["BL_821.8",821,[959,240,752,128]]]'>Thereafter, the trial court issued a rule upon the Auditors to show cause why the relief requested by Huff should not be grants ed. The Auditors responded by filing an answer in which they denied the material allegations of Huffs appeal. Asserting that Frantz and Barr had already paid back to the Township any payments which were improperly made to them, the Auditors denied Huffs allegation that the Township had suffered a loss.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b821-10" data-blocks='[["BL_821.11",821,[960,410,755,421]]]'>A <em>de novo </em>hearing was held before the trial court, at which the following facts were established.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> By letter dated January 14,1993, Huff advised Donald Way, the chairman of the Auditors, that Frantz and Barr received hourly compensation in violation of the Code. Huff further asked that the Auditors surcharge Frantz and Barr with the amount of this compensation.</p>
    <p id="b821-11" data-blocks='[["BL_821.12",821,[961,866,755,517]]]'>The Auditors considered Huffs allegations during their audit and concluded that the error had been made by the Township’s Secretary/Treasurer. Specifically, they concluded that the Seeretary/Treasurer improperly paid Frantz and Barr on an hourly basis for activities other than attending meetings. However, once the error was discovered, both Frantz and Barr agreed to repay the Township by foregoing payment for attendance at future meetings.</p>
    <p id="b821-12" data-blocks='[["BL_821.13",821,[961,1419,756,612]]]'>Thereafter, Frantz did not accept compensation for attendance at meetings until she had fully reimbursed the Township for the payments which had improperly been made to her. Barr elected not to receive payment for any meetings after the beginning of June, 1992. As a result, Barr did not accept compensation in an amount exceeding that which he owed to the Township. Therefore, the Auditors found that the Township had not suffered any loss due to the improper payments to Frantz and Barr, and accordingly, a surcharge was not warranted.</p>

Huff filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b822-4" data-blocks='[["BL_822.4",822,[202,552,759,610]]]'>The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the trial court erred in dismissing Huffs appeal and in thus denying his request that the Auditors surcharge Frantz and Barr in an amount equal to the improper payments that both received. Where the trial court conducts a <em>de novo </em>hearing, our scope of review is limited to a determination of whether the trial court manifestly abused its discretion or committed an error of law. <em>See McLaughlin v.

Most significant, however, is the fact that both supervisors, upon discovering the error, agreed to repay, and indeed reimbursed, the Township for the full amount of these erroneous payments.
