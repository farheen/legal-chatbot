Claim 53 requires that the amount of the resin be “at least twice the amount of the softener”. Considering the hydrocarbon oil to be the softener, either the range of 5 to 40 parts of softener or the range of 30-60 parts of resin does not appear to be accurately stated. The claim further requires that “the total amount of resins in said cement compound” shall not exceed “(M/4+20) parts, * * Since the Mooney viscosity of the SBR is said to be “about 90 to 200”, this limitation indicates that the resin content may range from 42% to <a id="p1529" href="#p1529" data-label="1529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1529</a>VO parts. This range is not the same range as the claimed “BO to 60 parts of a compatible resinous material”.</p>

      <p id="b852-11" data-blocks='[["BL_852.12",852,[212,2258,1324,225]]]'> Pike states that his cement may contain “between 50 and 150 parts of tackifier” per 100 parts of SBR. Claim 53 states that “the total amount of resins in said cement compound not exceeding about (M/4-|-20) parts”, M being the Mooney visocsity of the SBR. Thus, Pike, et al., in using a SBR with a Mooney viscosity of 100 (which is the maximum Mooney value disclosed by Pike and) within the minimum value satisfying appellants’ claimed ranges), exceeds the limits of claim 53 which would allow only (100/44-20=45 parts of resins per 100 units of SBR.</p>
