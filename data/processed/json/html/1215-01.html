It involves a man who died, leaving behind three women all claiming to be his legal surviving spouse. In an action immediately following his death in which the disposition of his body was at issue, the trial court ruled that “for the limited purposes of [that] hearing,” it appeared that appellee Betty Clement was the surviving spouse and thus, the court ordered the body released to her. Some nine months later, the trial court issued an order expanding the original ruling to declare that Betty Clement was the surviving spouse “for all purposes.” We are unable to discern any basis in law authorizing the trial court to expand its original final order in this manner in contravention of the general principle of finality of judgments, and hence must vacate the second order.</p>

In that case, however, the request for clarification sought nothing more than an explanation of the reasons for dismissing the case; it did not seek to change the order. The case at bar is significantly different, in that the second order here did more than clarify an ambiguity in the first order or provide an explanation of the reasons for the first order.</p>
