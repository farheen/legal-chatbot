    <p id="b1008-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.5",1008,[197,454,751,232]]]'>¶ 1 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appeals from an order entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County dismissing the charges against appellee, William E. Davis. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b1008-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.6",1008,[196,733,755,539]]]'>¶ 2 On July 29, 1998, police officers from the Derry Township Police Department arrested Davis for unlawful delivery and intent to deliver a non-eontrolled substance. The officers observed Davis attempting to sell a counterfeit substance to another person attending a concert at Her-sheypark Stadium. Following his arrest, Davis was found to be in possession of other non-eontrolled substances which were packaged for distribution.</p>
    <p id="b1008-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.7",1008,[194,1311,758,1088]]]'>¶ 3 After waiving his right to a preliminary hearing, Davis appeared before the court of common pleas for his trial date, which was scheduled for the November 16, 1998 criminal court term. However, the case was not called until the January 13, 1999 court term. Davis failed to appear for his January court date and a <em>capias </em>was issued for his arrest. Davis was located in Buffalo, New York, where he had been serving a jail sentence and was incarcerated from February 3, 1999 to March 13, 1999. His sentence resulted from charges arising in New York. On February 12,1999, during Davis’ New York incarceration, a detainer was lodged against him. On March 5, 1999, Davis agreed to waive his extradition and return to Pennsylvania. On March 13, 1999, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania obtained custody of Davis and placed him in Dauphin County Prison on March 15,1999.</p>
    <p id="b1008-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.11",1008,[997,217,751,479]]]'>¶ 4 On August 2, 1999, the day he was called to trial, Davis filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD), 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9101-9108, claiming he was not brought to trial within the 120 days following his return to Pennsylvania custody.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9101, Article IV. A hearing was held, briefs were submitted, and the motion was granted. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b1008-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.12",1008,[1001,718,745,89]]]'>¶ 5 The Commonwealth raises the following issue for our consideration:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1008-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.13",1008,[1038,820,709,326]]]'>Whether the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act applies where a fugitive is returned after completing a sentence in another state, but where the request for custody of that defendant is made while he is serving a sentence in the other state?</blockquote>
    <p id="b1008-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.14",1008,[997,1175,751,580]]]'>¶ 6 The Commonwealth essentially argues that the trial court incorrectly applied the IAD in dismissing the charges against Davis. The Commonwealth asserts that the proper law to be applied is the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (UCEA). 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9121-9148. If the trial court would have applied the UCEA, the Commonwealth contends, then Rule 1100 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure would control and a dismissal would not have been proper.</p>

Unlike a request for extradition, which is a request that the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated transfer custody to the requesting state,[<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>] a detainer is merely <a id="p961" href="#p961" data-label="961" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*961</a>a means of informing the custodial jurisdiction that there are outstanding charges pending in another jurisdiction and a request to hold the prisoner for the requesting state or notify the state of the prisoner’s imminent release. The IAN is remedial legislation intended to curb previous abuses and alleviate problems associated with prisoners’ uncertainty resulting from unresolved charges pending in another jurisdiction. Accordingly, the stated purpose of the IAD is to “encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informa-tions or complaints.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9101, Article I.</blockquote>

It first argues that the IAD does not apply because Davis agreed to waive his extradition and return voluntarily to Pennsylvania, thus invoking the UCEA. Second, the Commonwealth points out that it did not gain custody of Davis until <em>after </em>he had completed his sentence in New York. Because the IAD applies only to prisoners, the Commonwealth claims that it was not applicable to Davis upon his release.</p>

Lotwick requested the Erie County Holding Center in Buffalo to "lodge this capias as a detainer” by a letter to the prison dated February 16, 1999. Also in the letter was the sheriff's request that his office be notified upon Davis' release so that deputies could be sent to take the subject into custody. While a copy of this letter has been included in the appellee’s reproduced record, it has not been made a part of the certified record on appeal. Rather, the only reference made to such a letter in the certified record is a notation that reads "2-7-99 Sheriff Return filed.” The law is clear that this court may only review and consider matters which have been filed as part of the certified record. <em>Commonwealth v.
