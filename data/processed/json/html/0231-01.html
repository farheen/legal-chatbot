The actions were consolidated for the purposes of trial. The trial justice ruled that the real estate had been over-assessed for all four tax years and awarded to Weybosset Hill damages of $871,170.90, plus interest of $352,134.16, for a total of $1,223,358.01. The city appealed, raising several issues, the most significant of which questions the validity of the assignments.

It then carried over this assessment each year thereafter, including the tax years at issue in this case. Blue Cross, then the owner of the property, challenged the assessments for tax years 1997, 1998, and 1999. On July 23, 1998, Blue Cross entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Paolino Realty, LLC, the predecessor-in-interest to Weybosset Hill.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Two days before the closing, an assignment agreement was executed in which Blue Cross assigned to Weybosset Hill “all claims, rights, remedies, entitlements and obligations” relating to the pending appeals of tax years 1998 and 1999. On May 8, 2002, Blue Cross and Weybosset Hill executed a document entitled “Confirmatory Assignment and Acceptance” that memorialized the intent of the parties to assign the appeal for tax year 1997, which had been “inadvertently omitted” from the original assignment.</p>

Moreover, it challenged the assessment for the tax year 2000 in its own right. All such appeals were denied by the tax assessor and the board of tax assessment review, after which Weybosset Hill timely appealed to the Superior Court. The four cases eventually were consolidated, and were heard by a trial justice sitting without a jury in May 2002.</p>

He testified that he had been involved in appraisal work dealing with properties in Providence since the 1970s. Collins explained that there are three valuation methods one can employ when appraising real estate: the cost approach, the market sales comparison approach, and the income approach. The best evidence of value in a particular year, however, is an arm’s-length sale that occurred in that year. Consequently, he testified that the value of the property in 1999 was $2,500,000, which he calculated by deducting from the total purchase price the estimated, discounted value of the tax appeals and the cost of the parking lot.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[206,1196,755,1392]]]'>With respect to the other years, Collins posited that the income approach generally is preferred for valuing income-producing property, such as is at issue here. According to Collins, the income methodology weighs a number of factors, including the potential rental value of similar property, the property’s vacancy rate, and the overall vacancy rate in the city. In calculating the value of the subject property, he also made adjustments for various expenses and costs, including amortized capital improvements, leasing commissions, and parking operation expenses. Using this approach, Collins opined that the value of the property was $3,495,000 for tax year 1997, $3,895,000 for 1998, and $5,400,000 for 2000. All of Collins’s conclusions and calculations were included in an appraisal report that he prepared. The city objected to the introduction of this report, arguing that although it had requested the report months before trial, it received the report only ten or twelve days before the trial commenced and had insufficient time to review it. The report was entered into evidence over the city’s objection.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[208,2615,753,90]],["BL_264.7",264,[1007,295,754,1030]]]'>Weybosset Hill also presented testimony from Thomas Bovis (Bovis), an assistant vice president of engineering and administrative services for Blue Cross. His duties included real estate development, acquisition, and space planning. • Bovis explained the procedure Blue Cross used to authorize the sale of real estate. He further testified that part of the negotiations with Paolino Realty, LLC over the purchase of the property concerned an assignment of Blue Cross’s rights to its applications for tax abatements for tax years 1997, 1998, and 1999. In addition, Weybosset Hill produced as a witness Joseph R. Paolino, Jr. (Paolino), who also testified to the extensive “back-and-forth” negotiations and concessions each party made. Based upon the uncontradicted testimony of both Bovis and Paolino, the trial justice found that the sale of the property was indeed an arm’s-length transaction.</p>
    <p id="b264-7" data-blocks='[["BL_264.8",264,[1008,1351,753,761]]]'>Rossi did not appear at the trial because of medical reasons, but was permitted to submit testimony by affidavit. Specifically, Rossi characterized the sale as a “sale-leaseback,” which he said often is motivated by a desire to convert an illiquid real estate asset into cash, while retaining control and use of the facility. He further averred that such arrangements generally include a long-term lease commitment by the seller, a condition absent from this transaction. Thus, according to the city, the sale was not an arm’s-length transaction and therefore not a valid indicator of valuation.</p>

For instance, he asserted that Collins’s appraisal methodology did not conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. Rossi noted that the rental figure of $15 per square foot presented in Collins’s report was not accurate because the “Greater Providence Office Market Report” estimated comparable space between $15 and $20 per square <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>foot. He also noted that the property’s good location indicated that the rental value should be higher than $15 per square foot. He further averred, “The operating expenses, taxes, parking and utilities are the responsibility of the tenants,” not the owner. Therefore, those adjustments should not have been made against the value of the property. Rossi concluded, “The Gross Rent was understated, and the operating expenses are overstated.”</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[175,862,752,860]]]'>In lieu of closing arguments, both sides submitted multiple post-trial memoranda. The city also moved for judgment on partial findings pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, in which it renewed its previous argument that Weybosset Hill lacked standing to challenge the assessments for the 1997, 1998, and 1999 tax years. The city asserted that the right to appeal an assessment under the statute is personal to the taxpayer and may not be assigned. Further, it argued that, with respect to the 1999 tax, the account, which is a statutory prerequisite to seeking relief from a claimed overassessment, was filed by Blue Cross under oath and was not transferable.</p>

First, it asserts that the trial justice erroneously denied its motion to amend its answer to add the affirmative defense that Weybosset Hill had failed to perfect its appeal because it did not file “a true and exact account under oath” as required by G.L.1956 §§ 44-5-15 and 44-5-16. Second, the city contends that the trial justice erred by not granting a reasonable continuance because Rossi, for medical reasons, was unable to attend the trial. Finally, the city argues that Weybosset Hill lacked standing to appeal the tax assessments effectuated before it assumed ownership of the property. As we proceed to discuss each of these issues, additional facts will be supplemented as warranted.</p>

    <p id="b271-11" data-blocks='[["BL_271.11",271,[968,662,755,651]]]'>The trial justice compared the assignment in this case to that in <em>Cerberus </em>and found them to be strikingly similar. She reasoned, “[ljike in <em>Cerberus Partners, </em>the transfer of the appeals in the present case appears to be a market assignment involving a finite, purely economic transaction.” Moreover, the trial justice opined that any danger of establishing a commercial market in assessment appeals was remote “because the assignee purchased property along with the pending appeals, not merely the hypothetical right to bring an appeal.”</p>
    <p id="b271-12" data-blocks='[["BL_271.12",271,[966,1335,757,899]]]'>We endorse the trial justice’s reasoning and affirm her judgment. We add that the assignment not only was an essential component of the transaction, but also allowed Blue Cross to transfer all its interests related to the property to Weybosset Hill. This would seem to be the most appropriate outcome from a commercial point of view. After transferring its title to the property, a previous owner’s incentive to prosecute the appeals vigorously might well be diminished. Also, the subsequent purchaser would be placed in an untenable position if it were required to oversee or otherwise monitor the previous owner to ensure that its interests were being adequately protected in the litigation.</p>
