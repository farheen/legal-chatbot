Under the express provisions of section 4, already quoted, the court was granted authority to commit a defendant for a term not to exceed one year “in <em>default </em>of the payment of the fine imposed.” It is plain that the statute distinguishes between the failure of a defendant to pay his fine (that is, a default in its payment) and a case where he has been sentenced “in lieu of or in addition to any fine.” In other words, where a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of paying a fine (that is, in lieu of the fine), he may not be sentenced in excess of 10 days, or, if fined and also sentenced to imprisonment, the <em>additional </em>sentence of imprisonment may not be in excess of ten days.</blockquote>

The term of imprisonment, it is said, may always be avoided by payment of the fine. In Peeples v. District of Columbia, D.C.Mun.App., <a href="/a2d/75/0845-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="75 A.2d 845" data-case-ids="8153458" data-case-paths="/a2d/75/0845-01">75 A.2d 845</a> (1950), the defendant was convicted of being drunk in a public park and sentenced to pay a fine of $75 or, in default thereof, to serve 150 days, despite the fact that the statute making drunkenness an offense provided for a fine of $100 or imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both. He argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to impose a term of imprisonment in excess of that authorized by the statute prescribing the penalty for drunkenness because that statute, being a special one, limited the authority of the trial judge to sentence under the general statute permitting imprisonment for nonpayment of a fine. This court disagreed and explained that:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

    <blockquote id="b348-8" data-blocks='[["BL_348.11",348,[999,1248,712,847]]]'>It must be remembered that the alternative sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of fine is not imposed as a part of the penalty but as a means of compelling payment of the fine. The imprisonment may be avoided by payment of the fine, which of course cannot be done where imprisonment is the primary or original sentence. The special statute defines the punishment. The general statute provides a means of enforcing the punishment. In view of this we cannot say that under our statutes the mere fact the alternative imprisonment exceeds the term which could have been imposed on appellant as a primary sentence, makes the alternative sentence invalid.</blockquote>

Our statute gives broad discretion in imposing imprisonment in default of payment of a fine, but, as we have said, the alternative sentence is a mode of compelling payment of the fine. Its use should be confined to such. It should not be used for the purpose of imposing a longer term of imprisonment than is permitted by law. To do so is to do indirectly that which cannot be done directly. To impose on a man obviously without means a large fine, and in the alternative a long term of imprisonment, is to all practical effect the imposition of a straight term of imprisonment. In this case the alternative sentence of 150 days looks suspiciously as if the trial court decided, either for appellant’s good or for the good of the community, that appellant because of his record of approximately seventy convictions for drunkenness, should be confined for more than the thirty days permitted by the statute, and used the alternative sentence to accomplish this. If we were convinced that this was true, we would reverse, because Congress has fixed thirty days as the maximum term of imprisonment for the first offense of drunkenness and the court ought not to evade the legislative enactment under the guise of enforcing payment of a fine. If this can be done then a longer imprisonment can be imposed on a poor person than on one with means. Such is not the purpose of the law.</blockquote>
