Both parties had been married previously, and they resided together with the wife’s two minor children from her prior marriage at 5 Hughes Drive in Smithfield, Rhode Island (5 Hughes Drive). The parties separated in May 2008, and on November 4, 2003, the husband filed a complaint for absolute divorce, alleging irreconcilable differences, which had caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. The wife thereafter filed a counterclaim, also seeking absolute divorce on the same grounds as the husband. A trial followed in the Family Court, spanning sixteen days, from March 2005 to June 2005, during which both parties and several other witnesses testified. The trial justice issued a bench decision on October 81, 2005, which he reaffirmed in a subsequent written decision pending entry of final judgment.</p>

The parties had been married nine years. Since at least 2000, the husband had been verbally, physically, and sexually abusive to the wife, as well as verbally and physically abusive to her two children. He also acted in a controlling manner toward the three of them. The wife, for her part, had been verbally abusive to the husband. The trial justice concluded that the husband’s abuse of the wife and her children had caused her to leave him and ultimately had caused the breakdown of the marriage.</p>

Over the course of the marriage, the wife contributed roughly $64,000 to household expenses. The parties had a joint bank account into which the wife deposited her paycheck and, during periods of unemployment, any unemployment checks she received. The husband used money from this account to pay the mortgage, real estate taxes, and insurance for the marital domicile.</p>

The husband also engaged in home improvement projects, such as tiling the floors and building cabinets — projects with which the wife assisted. In contrast, the trial justice found that the husband made virtually no contribution — financial or otherwise — to either the Bishop Hill Road or Stanfordville lot properties.</p>

He held a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering and had been employed at the same company for more than fourteen years, making $43 per hour, plus benefits. In 2004, his gross pay was approximately $91,000. The husband also received Social Security payments of approximately $1,800 a month, as well as payments of $72 a month through a vested pension with a prior employer. As for the wife, the trial justice found that she was fifty-one years old at the time of trial. She held a Masters degree in religious studies but was employed by a temporary staffing agency doing medical billing. She worked thirty-five to forty hours per week and earned $13 per hour with no benefits. The wife also was enrolled in classes to become a registered medical assistant. The trial justice concluded that, notwithstanding the wife’s younger age and some financial support from her mother, plaintiff had a greater opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets and income. He based his finding on the husband’s job and “financial creativity.”</p>

He awarded the husband exclusive title to 5 Hughes Drive, but assigned the wife 60 percent of its appreciation in value from the date of the marriage. He also awarded each party exclusive title to one of the two timeshares acquired during the marriage.

He also assigned each party 50 percent of the appreciated value of the surrender values of each party’s respective life insurance policy and 50 percent of the appreciated value of the husband’s bank accounts. The trial justice further awarded the wife 100 percent of her bank accounts and the $400 child-credit tax rebate. He also assigned each party 50 percent of the appreciation in value of the husband’s 401(k) account and 50 percent of the appreciation in value of his annuity account. Lastly, despite finding in his bench decision that the husband’s pension account was nonmarital property, the trial justice, in his written decision, also awarded the wife 100 percent of that account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Specifically, the husband argues that the trial justice overlooked evidence of contradictions between the wife’s testimony at trial and her earlier sworn statements concerning her employment and finances. In addition, the husband contends that the trial justice overlooked the fact that he had produced complete financial records— more evidence that he claims the trial justice overlooked.

First, the husband challenges the trial justice’s finding that the length of the parties’ marriage was nine years, contending instead that the marriage was six-and-one-half years long. The length of a marriage is measured from the date of marriage to the entry of the final divorce decree. <em>See Ruffel, </em><a href="/a2d/900/1178-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="900 A.2d 1178" data-case-ids="8418722" data-case-paths="/a2d/900/1178-01">900 A.2d at 1185</a> (“In this state, ‘parties to a divorce action remain as husband and wife until the entry of the final decree of divorce.’ ”) (quoting <em>Vanni v.

The uncontroverted evidence indicates that the parties were married on November 8, 1996, and that the trial justice issued his bench decision on October 31, 2005, before entering a final divorce decree. Consequently, the trial justice did not err in <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>finding the length of the marriage to be nine years.</p>
    <p id="b695-5" data-blocks='[["BL_695.4",695,[81,380,752,706]]]'>Secondly, the husband takes issue with the trial justice’s finding that the husband’s conduct was the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. The husband contends that the trial justice overlooked evidence of the wife’s bad conduct during the marriage, specifically her arrest during a domestic dispute, as well as other incidents in which he alleges she was both verbally and physically abusive to him.

However, in accordance with his credibility findings, the trial justice chose not to believe the husband’s testimony, and instead found that the wife was not physically abusive to him. The trial justice did find that the wife was verbally abusive and that the husband had exhibited good conduct in the marriage up until around the year 2000, as it was corroborated by the wife’s testimony. Nevertheless, the trial justice’s finding that the husband’s egregious conduct in verbally, physically, and sexually abusing defendant and in verbally and physically abusing her children caused the marriage to deteriorate and the wife to leave him was supported by the testimony of both the wife and her daughter.</p>

The husband cites his own testimony that the wife did not contribute to the mortgage, taxes, or insurance on the property. Instead, the husband contends that the wife applied all of her income to pay for her children’s private school tuition and her credit card debt. He also argues that the wife contributed nothing to the household after the parties had separated in 2008.</p>

The husband acknowledged that the wife had deposited her paychecks into the parties’ joint checking account-an account that in turn was used to pay the mortgage, real estate taxes, and insurance at 5 Hughes Drive. He also acknowledged that the wife had done chores in the house, had assisted in various home improvement projects, and had purchased interior window dressings and carpeting.
