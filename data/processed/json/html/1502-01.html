The purpose of these tests was to show that the Paivinen test circuit had not been reduced to practice. The asserted lack of reduction to practice apparently relates to two aspects of the test apparatus employed in the Allen tests of 1952, namely, (1) an alleged inoperativeness of the Paivinen test circuit when used with the inspect pulse source supposedly “described” by the Paivinen witnesses, and (2) the failure of this pulse source to satisfy the language of Counts 1 to 5 calling for such source to be “incapable” of reversing the saturation condition of an input core.</p>

This did not work, and was then followed by two other tests, in both of which the inspect voltage was reduced to approximately 1.3 volts, which was in accord with Allen’s notebook, and the testimony on behalf of Paivinen. In the second test, the circuit had such a high circulating current during reset of the input cores that it also failed to operate successfully, whereas in the third test successful operation was achieved.

Improper operation resulted, and, indeed, the variable input core in these Sands’ tests completely switched in approximately 10 microseconds. This test obviously failed to duplicate the test conditions of the Allen tests.

This testimony alone, it seems to us, ⅛ completely adequate to establish a reduction to practice. Moreover, they testified that the pulse source in fact included a Burroughs type pulse delay unit, together with a modifying circuit element which served to reduce the output voltage of this unit from 20 to 30 volts to 1.3 volts (as shown in the photographs), and to reduce the inspect source impedance during inspect time from 100 or 200 ohms to about 15 ohms, while leaving it unaffected during non-inspect time.
