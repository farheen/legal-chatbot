The defendant was found guilty after a trial in the Superior Court on the charge of robbery and conspiracy to rob the manager of a motel. The issue raised at trial and before this court is whether sufficient evidence of aspor-tation exists to support the robbery charge. Both defendant and the state agree that “asportation” is a required element of the crime of robbery, as well as of larceny.

We conclude that the trial justice was correct in finding this evidence legally supported the conviction of robbery. We are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of asportation to support the robbery charge.</p>
