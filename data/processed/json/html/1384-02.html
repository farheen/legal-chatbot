Patton testified that she drove the vehicle because appellant had consumed a significant amount of alcohol between 10:00 a.m. and noon, and Patton believed that appellant was too intoxicated to drive. While waiting for appellant’s friends to arrive, appellant and Patton engaged in an argument and Patton left the vehicle to return to her place of employment, leaving appellant in the passenger seat of the truck, which was parked in the lot with the engine running. Approximately one hour later, a restaurant employee noticed the truck in the parking lot with its engine running and with appellant now in the driver’s seat and asleep at the wheel of the vehicle.

In <em>Byers, </em>in which the facts were very similar to those in the instant case, the defendant was asleep behind the wheel of a car in the parking lot of a bar with the engine and lights on. Although there was some dispute at trial as to whether the car had been moved within the parking lot, the defendant had not left the parking lot of the bar where he had been drinking. Under the circumstances of that case, the Superi- or Court held that there were insufficient facts to prove that the defendant posed a safely hazard to the public, and therefore the Commonwealth had failed to establish that he was in actual physical control of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 506, <a href="/a2d/650/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="650 A.2d 468" data-case-ids="11325437,706696" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0468-01,/pa-super/437/0502-01">650 A.2d at 470</a>. The <em>Byers </em>Court reasoned that penalizing a person for "sleeping it off” with the engine running for a purpose other than driving the vehicle (for example, to provide heat, operate the radio or power a car phone) would defeat this laudable purpose. <em>Byers, supra </em>at 508-09, <a href="/a2d/650/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="650 A.2d 468" data-case-ids="11325437,706696" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0468-01,/pa-super/437/0502-01">650 A.2d at 471</a>.</p>
      <p id="AsEB" data-blocks='[["BL_1458.6",1458,[1052,1947,722,723]]]'>However, nowhere in the statute is there a requirement that the fact-finder should consider whether or not one in actual physical control of a vehicle and under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances poses a threat to public safety. The legislature has reasonably determined that one driving a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways of the Commonwealth while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances constitutes a threat to public safety <em>per se, </em>even if there are no other members of the public immediately endangered. While it may be laudable that one who realizes that he is incapable of safe driving pulls over to "sleep it off,” the legislature has made no exception to the reach of the statute to such individuals. Accordingly, such a person’s threat to public safety is not a relevant consideration under the drunk driving statutes.</p>

The trial court’s instruction did not clearly, adequately and accurately present the law. The gravamen of the error in the instruction was that it did not leave the ultimate determination of whether Appellant had actual physical control of the vehicle to the jury as finder of fact. Rather, the trial court’s instruction effectively directed the jury to find as a fact that Appellant was in actual physical control of the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b1460-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1460.10",1460,[225,2069,759,384]]]'>Upon inquiry made by the jury, the trial court stated “[i]f they were seated in the driver’s seat, they would be in a position to control.” Effectively, the trial court mandated what conclusion was to be drawn from Appellant’s presence in the driver’s seat, thereby usurping the fact finding function of the jury.</p>
