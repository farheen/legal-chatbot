Fredette, appeals from a judgment convicting her of murder, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 201 (1983), after a jury trial in Superior Court (Lincoln County). She contends, among other things, that the trial justice committed prejudicial error by admitting hearsay testimony from three prosecution witnesses. We agree and remand for a new trial.</p>

He died the following day as a result of those gunshot wounds. At the time of the shooting, his wife and five of their six children were also present in the house. All of them were in bed except for Mrs. Fredette when the shots were fired. She testified that she was in the bathroom at that time. After hearing the shots, she claimed that she could not immediately get out of the bathroom because the door was somehow jammed. While stuck in the bathroom, she heard someone run through the kitchen and out the side door of the house. She was not able to see this person. She told the police essentially this same story, then became a prime suspect based on the police investigation following the murder. In September of 1978, a York County Grand Jury indicted Mrs. Fredette for the murder of her husband. Her first trial commenced on December 3, 1979, in Superior Court (Somerset County). This trial ended in a mistrial on December 20, 1979, because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Her retrial commenced on June 9, 1980, in Superior Court (Lincoln County) and she was found guilty as charged. She then appealed to this Court.</p>

I, § 8 of the Maine Constitution and the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After approximately ten hours of deliberation, the jury sent the trial justice a note that they could not reach a unanimous decision. Rather than declaring a mistrial on that basis, he met with counsel for both sides in his chambers and sought their views. Approximately one hour later, after consulting with counsel and contacting the jury through notes, he' once again instructed the jury in open court as to the procedure to arrive at a verdict. After the jury deliberated approximately three more hours, the trial justice informed counsel that he would ask the jury in open court whether there was any reasonable probability that a verdict could be reached on further deliberations. The trial court also informed counsel that he would excuse the jury if he found they were still deadlocked; defense counsel made no objection. The jury was thereupon returned to the courtroom and the foreman informed the court, in the presence of all jurors and counsel, that the jury was unable to reach a verdict and that there was no reasonable probability of reaching one upon further delibera<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>tions.

The trial justice sought the views of defense counsel, and defense counsel actively participated in the decision whether to grant a mistrial. At the point when the trial justice decided he would discharge the jury if they felt they could not reach a verdict, he made this known to defense counsel who offered no objection. Accordingly, we hold that defendant consented to the discharge of the jury and she, therefore, cannot now raise the bar of double jeopardy. <em>State </em>v. <em>McConvey, </em><a href="/a2d/459/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="459 A.2d 562" data-case-ids="7973604" data-case-paths="/a2d/459/0562-01">459 A.2d 562</a>, 565 n. 2 (Me.1983); <em>State v.

Sometime in January of 1977, Mr. Fredette asked him to appraise his fire damaged home. Mr. Fredette promised to pay him $5,000 on the condition that he would receive approximately $75,000 from his insurance company as a result of the appraisal. Although Laverriere performed the appraisal and the Fredettes received about $73,500, he was never paid by Fred Fre-dette. Laverriere then testified to a meeting that he had with Mrs. Fredette in October of 1977. He walked into a cafe that he frequented in Biddeford and saw Mrs. Fre-dette sitting at a table. He sat at the counter and placed an order. Sometime thereafter Mrs. Fredette asked if she could speak with him in private. After he finished eating, he left the cafe and Mrs. Fre-dette followed. They got into her car and drove towards the Saco-Old Orchard Beach area. At some point during their travels, Mrs. Fredette offered him $3,500 to find someone to kill her husband; he accepted the offer, never intending to fulfill his promise. She agreed to give him the money on the following Saturday (three or four days later). Prior to receiving the money on Saturday, he testified that he told, among others, Archie Droggitis, Anthony Frenette and Herschel Lerman about his conversation with Mrs. Fredette. On that Saturday, he testified that Mrs. Fredette gave him the $3,500 and requested that he find somebody to kill her husband.</p>

During the cross-examination at the first trial, defense counsel impeached Laverriere’s direct testimony by establishing that he told the police in June of 1978 and subsequently <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>testified before the grand jury that his meeting with Mrs. Fredette occurred in November of 1977. At the first trial, the trial justice ruled that, pursuant to M.R.Evid. 801(d)(1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> these witnesses could testify to prior consistent statements made by Laver-riere to rebut a charge of recent fabrication arising from defense counsel’s attack on the inconsistent dates.

His reasons for this ruling are not entirely clear. He seemingly accepted the State’s argument that the cross-examination would imply Laverriere had a motive to point the finger at Mrs. Fredette to avoid taking the blame for Mr. Fre-dette’s murder. Therefore, because these statements were made prior to the murder, he concluded that they were admissible to rebut the charge of improper motive. He alternatively ruled that the statements made by Laverriere to Frenette, Lerman and Droggitis were admissible as statements against interest pursuant to M.R. Evid. 804(b)(8). Subsequently, over defendant’s objections in each case, Frenette, Ler-man and Droggitis were allowed to testify in the State’s case in chief to statements by Laverriere concerning his meeting with Mrs. Fredette and her solicitation that he find somebody to kill her husband. On appeal, defendant claims the trial justice erred by allowing these witnesses to testify to those statements by Laverriere.</p>

In the circumstances of this case, Laverriere’s statements could not be considered declarations against penal interest because they did not tend to sub<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>ject him to a charge of theft by deception, or any other criminal charge, at the time they were made. Here, Mrs. Fredette purportedly came to Laverriere and offered him $3,500 to find someone to kill her husband. Laverriere did not take any money from her at the initial meeting, but rather they agreed that she would get the money by that Saturday. After that first meeting, but before Mrs. Fredette met with him again to pay him the money, Laverriere told Frenette, Lerman and Droggitis about Mrs. Fredette’s offer and that if she came up with the money, he would take the money as part payment for the money he considered the Fredettes owed him and not fulfill his promise to find someone to kill Mr. Fredette. In fact, he asked his attorney, Herschel Lerman, whether he could accept the money from Mrs. Fredette and his attorney told him that he could do so. Having made these statements before taking the money from Mrs. Fredette, Laverri-ere could not be subject to a charge of theft by deception when he made these statements. At most, Laverriere’s statements reflect an intent to possibly commit a crime. Because one cannot be charged solely with an intent to commit a crime without anything more,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Laverriere’s statements to Frenette, Lerman and Droggitis cannot be considered statements against penal interest at the time they were made.</p>

We think that these rulings are also erroneous. In a simplified sense liability for defamation, in this case slander, turns on whether the statement tends, or is reasonably calculated, to cause harm to another’s reputation. Of course, generally speaking, truth is a complete defense to an action for slander. <em>Picard v. Brennan, </em><a href="/a2d/307/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="307 A.2d 833" data-case-ids="11733646" data-case-paths="/a2d/307/0833-01">307 A.2d 833</a> (Me.1973). Therefore, one would tend to be subject to liability for defamation only if he was spreading lies. In light of this, it is apparent that this basis for admitting Laverriere’s statements completely misses the purpose of admitting statements against interest. The purpose underlying this exception to the hearsay rule is that “a statement asserting a fact distinctly against one’s interest is unlikely to be deliberately false or heedlessly incorrect”. 5 Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>§ 1427, at 329. It is irrelevant whether the statement of fact could tend to create liability; it is the <em>fact </em>stated which must be against interest. <em>In Re Weber, </em><a href="/cal-3d/11/0703-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="11 Cal. 3d 703" data-case-ids="2302334" data-case-paths="/cal-3d/11/0703-01">11 Cal.3d 703</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=523%20P.2d%20229" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="523 P.2d 229">523 P.2d 229</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20429" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="114 Cal. Rptr. 429">114 Cal.Rptr. 429</a> (1974); 5 Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>§ 1462, at 337. The only way Laverriere’s statements would tend to be defamatory is if they were false or suspect. Therefore, to allow defamatory statements into evidence under this exception would conflict with the purpose that statements against interest are regarded as true because a person would not lie about such matters. Finally, there is simply nothing in the record to support a conclusion that Laverriere’s statements would make him the object of hatred, ridicule or disgrace.</p>

If defense counsel’s cross-examination or other evidence implied that Laverriere’s motive to lie arose sometime after he made the prior consistent statements, then the prior statements would be admissible to rebut the charge of improper motive. However, a prior consistent statement does not rebut a charge of improper motive where the motive to falsify also existed at the time of the earlier statement. <em>State v.

In other words, the prior consistent statements at issue may very well rebut any suggestion that Laverriere concocted this story when he spoke with the police in June of 1978 in order to avoid suspicion, but they would not be admissible unless defendant’s cross-examination and other evidence suggested that possibility. <em>State v.

Defendant established that Laverri-ere harbored an ill will against the Fre-dettes well before October of 1977 and that he knew about the Fredette gun collection from personal experience when he lived with them. In light of the fact that the State had previously attempted to establish on their direct case that the murder weapon was owned by the defendant, this line of cross-examination implied that he possibly could have framed Mrs. Fredette and that he made the statements to Frenette, Ler-man and Droggitis in October of 1977 as part of that plan to do so. As such, the prior consistent statements would not operate to rebut defendant’s claim that Laverri-ere had concocted this story as part of a plan to inculpate Mrs. Fredette.

It was highly prejudicial to erroneously allow three witnesses to testify to prior statements by Laverriere that corroborated his trial testimony.

Attempt to commit a crime requires more than intent. 17-A M.R.S.A. § 152(1) (1983) provides in part: “A person is guilty of criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the crime, and with intent to complete the commission of the crime, he engages in conduct which, in fact, constitutes a substantial step towards its commission.”</p>

On the facts of this case, it would have been error for the trial justice to have based the admissibility of the prior consistent statements solely on the fact that the cross-examination established an inconsistency in dates.

On cross-examination, defense counsel asked these witnesses whether Norman Laverriere, a former Police Commissioner of Biddeford, was possibly related to Gerard Laverriere. The State argues that this line of questioning implied that Gerard Laverriere was related to a Police Commissioner who would have had access to the gun permit applications filed by Mr. and Mrs. Fredette. One application was signed by defendant and the State attempted to prove this gun was the murder weapon. The State contended that this implied Gerard Laverriere was the murderer and that he had a motive and plan to frame Mrs. Fredette. Although the State does not seem to grasp the point, it is significant that this plan to frame Mrs. Fredette would have arisen before the murder and defense counsel’s cross-examination of Laverriere suggested that the statements to Lerman, Fren-ette and Droggitis were part of this plan.</p>

However, Charles Cyr and Raymond Ledoux merely testified to Laverriere’s longstanding hatred for the Fredettes. Roger Tar-diff testified, as relevant here, that Laverriere belonged to the Eagles Club and that that organization had a longstanding feud with the Fredettes. This testimony does not suggest anything more than Laverriere had hated the Fredettes for a long time. Furthermore, this evidence came after prior statements by Laver-riere were admitted into evidence. We have previously stated that prior consistent statements should not be admitted before there has been a suggestion of recent fabrication or improper motive or influence. <em>State v.

In <em>Baron, </em>defendant argued that a written memorandum was improperly admitted under F.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) because the memorandum was part of a plan to inculpate defendant. The Court held that the memorandum was admissible because, among other reasons, the cross-examination implied that the improper motive (self-exculpation) first arose when the declar-ant was accused of the crime charged. Because the memo was prepared over a year before he was accused, it was admissible as a prior consistent statement.
