Cummins, d/b/a Bob Cummins Construction Co., appeals from the determination of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation, denying his bid protest on the basis that it was untimely.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Section 1711.1(b) of the Procurement Code (Code), 62 Pa.C.S. § 1711.1(b), requires a bidder or prospective contractor on a Department project to file his protest “within seven days after the aggrieved bidder or ... prospective contractor knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest....” On appeal, we are asked to determine when, as a matter of law, Cum-mins should have known of the facts giving rise to his protest. After a review of the statutory scheme, we conclude that <em>at the latest, </em>Cummins should have known of all pertinent facts giving rise to his protest on the date that his bid was filed. Therefore, since Cummins’ protest was filed more than seven days after he filed his bid, his protest was untimely. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

According to Cummins’ protest, his bid met the fifty percent threshold requirement. Cummins asserted that while two particular work items, specifically line numbers 0017 and 0023, had been classified with the work codes “P” and “P8,” which he was not classified to perform,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> the skills/work actually involved in those work items required a significant amount of excavation work (properly classified as “C” and “Cl”), Which Cummins was classified to perform.

According to Cum-mins, line items 0017 and 0023 should have been given multiple work code classifications to more accurately reflect the nature of the work involved.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Since Cummins believed those particular line numbers should have been deemed to include “C” and “Cl” codes, he was, in fact, classified and competent to perform the majority of the work required by those line numbers and, when those two lines were included in his bid, his bid met the fifty percent threshold. Since the Department awarded the project to the next lowest bidder, Cummins also requested a stay of the award of the project contract.</p>

With respect to the timeliness of the protest, the Department concluded that Cummins needed to file his protest, at the latest, within seven days of November 4, 2004, the date that Cummins submitted his bid (which was also the date of bid-letting). The Department noted that at the time Cummins submitted his bid, he knew which classification codes he was prequali-fied to bid on as well as the codes that the Department had assigned to the work <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>items involved in the project. The Department further noted that, had Cummins simply evaluated his bid to determine whether he met the fifty percent threshold, he would have realized at that time that the work items (as coded by the Department) that he was classified to bid on did not meet the fifty percent threshold. According to the Department, at least by that time, Cummins should have had the requisite knowledge to submit a bid protest premised on any belief that certain work items had been miscoded based on the work involved. Consequently, the Department determined that Cummins’ protest was untimely.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The present appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

This argument is without merit. Cummins’ protest was based upon the assertion that two project items were assigned the wrong classification codes, and had the item been properly classified, Cummins would have met the prequalification requirements. Thus, the salient facts giving rise to his protest were the codes assigned to the two work items and the codes for which Cummins has been prequalified, and the relevant inquiry is when Cummins knew or should have known these facts. As noted above, the description of each work item and its corresponding code was included in the proposal for bids published in early September 2004, and Cummins does not claim that he was unaware of the classifications in which he is prequalified.</p>
    <p id="b581-9" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[943,615,750,248]]]'>Cummins appears to base his claim on the argument that since work item 0023 was described as a “trench,” he had no duty to determine what specific classification code had been assigned. He states:</p>

This does not mean that he “should have” done so. There was nothing in the use of the [Department’s] defined term “trench” that should have put [Cummins] on notice that something other than (not merely in addition to) excavation was involved in the performance of Project Item No. 0023.

Indeed, the purpose of these regulations, which establish a method by which contractors obtain ongoing prequalification certificates for specified types of work designated by the classification codes, is to avoid the necessity of a subjective review of the bidders’ qualifications in connection with each project. Cummins’ argument, that one need only review the textual description of the work and not the codes to determine if he is qualified to bid on a proposal, is in derogation of the clear regulatory scheme. Section 457.5(d) provides that “[e]ach prequal-ified contractor shall be eligible to bid on projects in which the types of work <em>for which he is classified </em>constitute at least 50 % of the project.” 67 Pa.Code § 457.5(d) (emphasis added).

We agreed with the Department of Public Welfare, the contracting agency, that such protest was untimely because the audit report was distributed to all potential bidders on January 21, 2000, as part of materials supplied following a pre-proposal conference and the Department’s handbook specified that such answers constituted a formal amendment to the request for proposal. We agreed with the Department that once the audit report became a formal amendment to the request for proposal, the disappointed bidder had seven days from the time it received the information to file a protest because at that point it knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest.
