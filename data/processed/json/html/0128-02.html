In the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court is asked to consider both an <em>Atkins </em>claim and an Atkins-related question. The derivative claim is strictly procedural: whether appellant Edward Bracey is entitled to have a jury entertain his post-conviction <em>Atkins </em>claim, raised under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>See Ring v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/536/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="536 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1254507" data-case-paths="/us/536/0584-01">536 U.S. 584</a>, <a href="/us/536/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="536 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1254507" data-case-paths="/us/536/0584-01">122 S.Ct. 2428</a>, <a href="/us/536/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="536 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1254507" data-case-paths="/us/536/0584-01">153 L.Ed.2d 556</a> (2002). The PCRA court concluded that appellant’s <em>Atkins </em>claim, which was impeded by counsel’s inexplicable refusal to present evidence of mental retardation to the PCRA judge, was meritless, and that rendered his request for a jury trial moot. The court dismissed appellant’s serial PCRA petition. For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the jury trial claim should have been reached but, on the merits, there is no federal constitutional right to a jury trial for <em>Atkins </em>claims presented in collateral proceedings. As will be explained, we vacate the PCRA court’s order and remand for an evidentiary hearing and bench determination of appellant’s <em>Atkins </em>claim.</p>

In his brief in support of the PCRA petition, appellant asserted that there was sufficient evidence of mental retardation presented at the 1998 PCRA hearing and in the supporting affidavits entered at the prior proceeding that would justify an evidentia-ry hearing on his <em>Atkins </em>claim.

The Commonwealth asserts that any other result might ultimately reward appellant’s federal counsel for their gamesmanship, which the Commonwealth submits was a strategy to bypass the state courts on the substantive <em>Atkins </em>question. Thus, the Commonwealth avers that refusing to remand the matter would reward appellant’s “contumacy by enabling him to raise the claim anew in a federal habeas petition, without the burden of fact-finding by the state courts.” Brief of the Commonwealth at 17. The Commonwealth argues that appellant’s stated rationale for refusing to introduce relevant evidence before the PCRA judge of his supposed mental retardation — a professed fear of thereby waiving his claim of an existing “right” to a jury determination — is “nonsense,” since appellant made an objection before the PCRA court, which the court specifically noted that the objection preserved the jury question for this Court’s review. The Commonwealth hypothesizes that such a facially risky position suggests that appellant and his counsel have their strategic sights set on <em>de novo </em>habeas corpus review in the local federal courts, which appellant’s federal lawyers view as a more sympathetic forum in capital matters. Luring this Court into finding the <em>Atkins </em>claim waived, the Commonwealth argues, “would offer them their best long-term prospect for relief,” since “if no <em>Atkins </em>hearing is held in state court, defense counsel will argue on habeas review that defendant is entitled to such a hearing in federal court. And, since it has been decades since the federal courts have upheld a sentence of death with respect to any Philadelphia prisoner who did not consent to be executed, they will find themselves in a remarkably favorable forum for that argument.” <em>See </em>Brief of the Commonwealth at 19-20.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The Federal Community Defender’s position below was obviously risky and tenuous: both the notion that appellant would somehow waive the claim of a right to a jury, or would somehow be prejudiced by presentation of his case to a judicial factfinder, as well as the substantive claim of an <em>Atkins </em>jury trial “right” of constitutional import which, as we explain below, finds no support in any existing, governing authority. Indeed, this is so much the case that it lends some credence to the Commonwealth’s position that the strategy below was designed to ensure that no state court judge would pass upon the merits of the <em>Atkins </em>claim (or if it did, it would only be after the substantial delay occasioned by an incomplete record and appeal to this Court, seeking remand).</p>

Instead, it suggests that this Court overlook this logical conclusion and remand this matter so that a bench <em>Atkins </em>hearing can be held, thus ensuring that the state court serves its primary role as the initial forum for constitutional claims, and avoiding the initial federal determination of <em>Atkins </em>that appellant seems to prefer.</p>

After all, salutary Pennsylvania procedural doctrine should not be defeated by attorney manipulations or even by concerns with subsequent federal habeas corpus review. But there is more.

If the court had specifically ruled on the jury trial question in the Commonwealth’s favor, the court should then have proceeded to rule upon the anticipatory defense request for interlocutory review. Explicit denial of that request, in turn, would have conveyed to appellant in unmistakable terms that, absent a request for interlocutory review in this Court, a refusal to abide by the determination on the jury request and “rest” instead upon obviously inadequate “papers” would result in a waiver of any future opportunity to present additional evidence relating to <em>Atkins.</em>

Moreover, the court’s finding of mootness on the jury trial question does not follow at all from the finding that the <em>pre-Atkins </em>record was insufficient. Logically, the jury trial issue was distinct from, and preliminary to, the <em>Atkins </em>question. The PCRA court essentially allowed the jury trial question to go unresolved, did not explicitly put appellant to the evidentiary choice and consequent waiver he should have faced if it was unpersuaded by the jury trial claim (as it should have been under existing authority), and then passed upon what amounted to a faux <em>Atkins </em>claim that not only was meritless, but also meaningless, since appellant, who was granted a hearing, chose not to proffer any evidence targeted to <em>Atkins.</em>

A post-conviction <em>Atkins </em>claim, however, is not a typical new rule claim. Most new rules look back to the proceeding producing the judgment of sentence, and if that proceeding is deficient under the new rule, and the new rule applies retroactively, the judgment will be undone and a new proceeding awarded. Not so with a collateral <em>Atkins </em>claim. By definition, there is no prior mental retardation/death eligibility decision, wrapped into the judgment of sentence, to be revisited under a new substantive rule. Instead, a post-conviction <em>Atkins </em>claim raises a new claim that was not contemplated, much less adjudicated, at the time of the earlier proceedings and judgment. Thus, properly understood, the <em>Ring </em>question presented in the <em>Atkins </em>setting is whether the defendant has the procedural right to a jury at his prospective <em>Atkins </em>hearing. Such a scenario does not fit so neatly into traditional retroactivity doctrine.</p>

Rather, death is the statutorily authorized penalty for that class of persons who are found guilty of first-degree murder, the circumstances of which involve certain aggravating factors that are found, by a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. Certainly, these statutory aggravating factors can be offset by the finding of mitigating factors, but that does not change the bedrock fact that the Pennsylvania penalty scheme sets the maximum penalty at death for capital defendants who meet both criteria — first-degree murder and one or more of certain statutory aggravating circumstances.

We do not address appellant’s claim pursuant to <em>Danforth </em>that this Court can go further than the High Court and apply <em>Ring </em>to our own post-conviction proceedings as a matter of state law. Appellant did not raise the issue below, and, as such, it is waived. Pa.R.A.P. 302. Moreover, this claim is distinct from appellant's central claim — the 6th and 14th Amendments command a jury trial — and is not cognizable under PCRA, as it does not involve death eligibility, does not fit within any exception to the jurisdictional time-bar under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1), and, in any event, was not raised within 60 days of the date it could have been presented as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2).</p>
