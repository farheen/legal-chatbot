The complaint alleges that in the course of a single delivery, Bush and Ballway viewed the photograph that gave rise to the allegedly tortious conduct in Massachusetts. Although the photograph may have been the impetus for the alleged torts in this case, viewing a photograph in these circumstances does not constitute purposeful availment of this state’s jurisdiction. An indispensable component in each case is “some act by which the defendant purposefully avails [himself] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” <em>Ben’s Marine Sales, </em><a href="/a2d/502/0808-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="502 A.2d 808" data-case-ids="7899155" data-case-paths="/a2d/502/0808-01">502 A.2d at 810</a> (quoting <em>Hanson v.

We discern no evidence that defendant engaged in any conduct suggesting that he reached out to Rhode Island to invoke the benefits and protections of our laws. Because Bush made deliveries for Martin throughout New England, it is likely that Bush also entered a number of other states during the same one-year period. These contacts, standing alone, are insufficient to warrant the exercise of specific <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over him for a tort allegedly committed elsewhere.</p>

The record is barren of any evidence that establishes that Bush acted in such a way as to purposefully avail himself of the benefits of this state, his work-related trips into Rhode Island notwithstanding. We agree with the trial justice that the mere fact that Bush was in Rhode Island to make deliveries in connection with his employment is not sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the decision.</p>

The trial justice ordered that judgment be entered under Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and the clerk entered judgment on May 19, 2005. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on May 24, 2005, with a notation that judgment had not yet been entered. The defendant filed a "motion to strike” the notice of appeal in the Superior Court and a motion to dismiss the appeal in this Court, based on plaintiff’s failure to transmit the record on a timely basis. The defendant filed a second “motion to strike” plaintiff’s notice of appeal on November 21, 2005. According to the Superior Court docket, that motion was heard and granted on December 8, 2005, and an unsigned order was appended to defendant’s Sup.Ct. R. 12A statement. However, there is no order, signed or unsigned, in the Superior Court case file. Furthermore, this Court took up the motion to dismiss before us and granted a conditional order of dismissal pending the filing of a transcript by February 3, 2006. We granted an extension of this deadline, <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>with which plaintiff complied.
