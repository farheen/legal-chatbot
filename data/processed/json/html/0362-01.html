      <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>The issues in this appeal are: (1) whether the trial court erred in concluding that the failure of a district justice or the police to inform the licensee that her privileges would be suspended if she pleaded guilty to the underlying driving offense does not render the suspension invalid; and (2) whether the trial court erred in concluding that, for the purpose of determining whether the underlying conviction for driving while her license was suspended provides an adequate legal basis to support the department’s suspension of the licensee’s privileges, courts are bound by the department’s effective date of a suspension rather than by the date upon which a licensee surrenders her license to the department.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[203,1062,748,417]]]'>' The facts, as determined by the trial court, are as follows. The department sent a notice dated November 29, 1991 to the licensee informing her that, as a result of her July 24, 1991, conviction for driving during a period when her privileges were suspended, the department was suspending her privileges for a period of one year, in accordance with section 1543 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1543.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[201,1504,749,515]]]'>The licensee appealed that order and the trial court conducted a de novo hearing. The licensee does not dispute the fact that she pleaded guilty to the July 24 citation. Rather, she asserts that the plea is not valid, and cannot provide a basis to support the department’s suspension of her license under section 1543(c)(1) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. § 1543(c)(1), because no one advised her at the time of her plea that the plea would result in a one-year suspension of her license.</p>

However, as the department notes, <em>Duffey </em>is a case involving the mandatory suspension of a license under section 6310.4 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6310.4, which provides for driver’s license suspension where a driver pleads guilty to or is found guilty of certain offenses relating to the possession, consumption and transportation of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of twenty-one.</p>

In <em>Duffey, </em>the court noted that the suspension under the Crimes Code provisions constituted the actual criminal penalty for the Crimes Code violation. The license suspension in the present case clearly is a “collateral civil consequence” of the underlying vehicle operator’s conviction.</p>
