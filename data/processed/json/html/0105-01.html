    <p id="b144-17" data-blocks='[["BL_144.18",144,[997,322,751,416]]]'>On January 19, 1971, between 9 a. m. and 9:30 a. m. the South Berwick Branch of the First National Bank of Biddeford was “held up.” Three men entered the bank, two were identifiable as white men despite the fact they wore ski masks in an obvious attempt to conceal their identity. The third man, identified as a black man, wore no mask.</p>
    <p id="b144-18" data-blocks='[["BL_144.19",144,[996,784,750,174]]]'>When the robbers left the bank they were driven away in an automobile, the driver of which was not one of the three who entered the bank.</p>

Included in this money was an amount witnesses described as “bait money”. The “bait money” was described as being bills of various denominations, the serial numbers of which had been previously recorded to facilitate identification. The so-called “bait money” had been deliberately placed in the head teller’s drawer. As this money was removed from the special clip, two automatic cameras in the bank lobby were activated.</p>
    <p id="b144-20" data-blocks='[["BL_144.21",144,[991,1613,753,1053]],["BL_145.1",145,[141,209,752,570]]]'>In the course of the investigation of the robbery, the police found a car bearing New Hampshire license plates abandoned near the bank. New Hampshire authorities identified the car as belonging to Grace Bailey of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. A Portsmouth police officer was dispatched to the Bailey residence to make inquiries concerning the auto found in South Berwick. At about 1 p. m. that day the Portsmouth police officer was invited into the apartment by a female houseguest of Mrs. Bailey. Mrs. Bailey told the officer that she had loaned her car to a man named “Bobby” early that morning. After determining that Mrs. Bailey would be able to identify “Bobby,” the officer called for photographs and “mug books” to be brought to the apartment. From these pictures Mrs. Bailey identified “Bobby.” By this time four Portsmouth policemen, headed by a Lieutenant, were in the apartment. <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>One of the detectives noticed that Mrs. Bailey appeared nervous. The officer, fearing danger if armed persons were in the apartment, asked for permission to “look around.” Mrs. Bailey testified that before she could respond the detective walked through a bedroom and, opening a door, walked into the kitchen. The Lieutenant testified that Mrs. Bailey responded affirmatively to a request to “look around” after being told that “there might be some danger.”</p>
    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[139,835,752,523]]]'>Upon opening the kitchen door the detective saw three men, two white men (one of whom was appellant) and one black man seated at a table playing cards. The three were taken into custody. An officer testified at the trial that he purported to take custody of the appellant under the authority of a New Hampshire statute which he interpreted as permitting a four-hour detention of one suspected of a crime without formal arrest. N.H.R.S.A. ch. 594, § 2.</p>
    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[138,1412,752,852]]]'>After removing the three men from the apartment, consent to search the apartment was requested by the officers. During the afternoon of January 19, 1971, additional police officers both from Maine and New Hampshire as well as two FBI agents were in the Bailey apartment. The Portsmouth Police Lieutenant, fearing Mrs. Bailey might be involved in the bank robbery, read the “Miranda warning” to her, informed her of her right to refuse permission to search, then procured the signatures of Mrs. Bailey and her female house-guest on a consent to search form. At some point an unidentified policeman stated that if the consent to search could not be secured, Mrs. Bailey would have to be taken “downtown.”</p>

    <p id="b145-14" data-blocks='[["BL_145.14",145,[943,1507,749,514]]]'>Appellant’s first claim of error is that the denial of his motion to suppress the gloves, ski masks, guns and money found in the search of Grace Bailey’s apartment was erroneous. In support of this claim appellant characterizes the police action as two searches: The first when the detective walked into the kitchen and discovered appellant; the second when the Police searched for and found the evidence and fruits of the crime.</p>

      <em>“We need not hold that all evidence is </em>‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ <em>simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.

She had recovered from a “hard” delivery and was caring for a young infant. Three persons, suspected of robbing a bank, had been found in her kitchen and removed by the police. An unknown policeman had stated that she might be “taken downtown” if her premises could not be searched. The Lieutenant who had assumed control of the inquiry and who ultimately gained her consent for the search believed that she was possibly involved in the crime.. The Lieutenant wisely, in light of his belief, read the “Miranda warnings” to Mrs. Bailey. While this was wise police procedure, under the circumstances it may have reinforced Mrs. Bailey’s fear that she was a suspect or was implicated in the robbery. On these facts alone, it might be difficult to hold that a signed consent to search was “an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.” Johnson v. Zerbst, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">304 U.S. 458</a>, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">58 S.Ct. 1019</a>, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">82 L.Ed. 1461</a> (1938).</p>
    <p id="b146-10" data-blocks='[["BL_146.10",146,[1014,1010,751,752]]]'>The trial justice at the suppression hearing heard testimony that the Police Lieutenant inquired of Mrs. Bailey and her houseguest whether they had knowledge of the bank robbery or knowledge of any “guns, money or disguises in the house.” After receiving a negative response from both women, the Lieutenant requested permission to conduct a search of the premises. He informed the women that the search was for guns, money and disguises. Both women indicated assent, both read the consent form, the Lieutenant explained to both that they had a right to refuse a search, then both women signed the consent form.</p>

Three men had been found in her home who were, at the least, suspects, and she had been given the “Miranda warning” which may have caused her to believe that she too was a suspect. All of these circumstances were the result of a normal and proper investigation by the police. Although they may have created a feeling of apprehension in Mrs. Bailey, they were not attempts to coerce a consensual search of the apartment.</p>

    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[115,1369,750,422]]]'>However, upon reading the entire record it is apparent to us that although Mrs. Bailey was upset and frightened by the events of that afternoon, her primary reason for allowing the search was that she believed her innocence would be established by the search.

The response to the situation confronting Mrs. Bailey, the consent to search, was not based upon the isolated statement, but upon the entire chain of events in the investigation. This chain of events was not a police controlled coercion of Mrs. Bailey. Her motives, in light of the situation facing her, indicate that the consent was a voluntary response that was, she believed, in her best interest.</p>
