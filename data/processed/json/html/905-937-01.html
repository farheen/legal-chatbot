On January 16, 1990, the hospital filed a petition for an order continuing hospitalization for up to seven days. The Superior Court granted the petition that same day and appointed respondent to represent Mr. Price, along with five other clients. Respondent fulfilled his obligations to three of the clients, but testified that he was not informed of his representation of Mr. Price until January 24, 1990. By that date, Mr. Price’s right to request a probable cause hearing had passed. Based upon evidence concerning the procedures by which the court notifies attorneys of their appointments to represent mental health patients, including monitoring and telephone calls to the attorneys to ensure that materials were picked up within two to three days of appointment, the Hearing Committee determined that it was unlikely that respondent remained unaware of the appointment.</p>

Respondent testified that sometimes the court would allow a probable cause hearing <a id="p939" href="#p939" data-label="939" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*939</a>after the statutory seven days, but respondent did not ascertain whether Mr. Price wanted such a hearing. Respondent testified he thought that a probable cause hearing would be “an exercise in futility.” He testified that he attempted to speak with Mr. Price by telephone, but Mr. Price would not accept his call. Mr. Price did not attend his hearing at the Mental Health Commission on February 6. The Commission rescheduled the hearing for February 20. In the interim, Mr. Price sought other counsel at the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, Mr. Richard Fugate. Mr. Fugate contacted Ms. Laurie Davis, an attorney at the Mental Health Division of the Public Defender Service (PDS). Ms. Davis investigated the matter and found that respondent represented Mr. Price and that Mr. Price was entitled to a hearing. Mr. Fugate related this information to Mr. Price along with Ms. Davis’ telephone number. Mr. Price telephoned Ms. Davis who informed him that he should contact respondent, and she gave him respondent’s telephone number. Mr. Price left several messages with respondent’s secretary, but never spoke with respondent. On February 15, Ms. Davis informed Mr. Price that the Commission had rescheduled his hearing for February 20. Mr. Price explained that he wanted a new attorney and Ms. Davis advised him to request one in writing.</p>

On February 20, the Chair of the Mental Health Commission called respondent to request his attendance, but respondent was prevented from leaving his office because of a bomb scare at the adjacent Prince George’s County Courthouse in Maryland. The hearing was rescheduled for February 22.</p>

Mr. Fulton decided not to replace respondent, and told Mr. Price that he had spoken to respondent that morning and respondent promised to contact Mr. Price before a new hearing. Respondent or his staff left a message for Mr. Price at the hospital stating that respondent would soon visit, but respondent never did so. Respondent failed to appear for the February 22 hearing, and the Commission removed him as counsel, appointed Mr. Fulton and rescheduled the hearing for March 22, 1990. Respondent testified that when the Chair of the Mental Health Commission told him the hearing was for “next Thursday,” he understood that to mean the hearing was on March 1, not February 22.</p>

The court granted the probable cause hearing, but the issues to be decided in the hearing were rendered moot by the hospital’s conversion of Mr. Price’s status from involuntary to voluntary.</p>

The next day, the hospital filed a petition for an order continuing her hospitalization for up to seven days, which the trial court granted. Respondent was appointed to represent Ms. Lassiter on the same day he was appointed to represent Mr. Price. From January 16 to January 23, respondent failed to contact Ms. Lassiter. On January 23, the day her right to a probable cause hearing was to expire, Ms. Lassiter asked the staff at the hospital how she could get an attorney. Staff provided her the number for PDS. She telephoned <a id="p940" href="#p940" data-label="940" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*940</a>PDS and spoke with Harry Fulton, who, in turn, called the court to inquire about Ms. Lassiter’s status at the hospital. Mr. Fulton also called respondent, but he was not in his office. Ms. Lassiter called respondent throughout the day, but no one returned her calls. Mr. Fulton, Ms. Lassiter, and the Clerk’s Office scheduled a hearing for January 24, 1990, and the court notified respondent of the hearing. Respondent met Ms. Lassiter for the first time just before the probable cause hearing. The court determined there was probable cause for Ms. Las-siter’s continued commitment.</p>

On September 13, Mr. Rosebure’s statutory right to request a probable cause hearing expired, and that same day, the hospital filed a petition for his judicial hospitalization. A hearing before the Mental Health Commission was scheduled for October 13. According to respondent, either his staff did not inform him of the hearing, or the hospital again misinformed him that Mr. Rosebure was a voluntary patient, and respondent did not contact Mr. Rosebure.</p>

Mr. Norman did not contact Mr. Rosebure, apparently because both Mr. Colley and Mr. Norman believed, based on Mr. Rosebure’s representations, that he was a voluntary patient. On September 27, Mr. Rosebure telephoned Mr. Norman, who learned from the Mental Health Commission that Mr. Rose-bure was an involuntary patient and that respondent was his counsel. Mr. Norman telephoned respondent and discussed whether respondent had advised Mr. Rosebure about his rights. Respondent replied that he did not know whether he had seen Mr. Rose-bure but that a member of his staff might have seen him. Respondent promised to check with his staff members who prepared new mental health cases. Respondent took Mr. Norman’s name and number, but he never called back.</p>

Mr. Ryan then prepared a letter to Judge Block of the Superior Court, stating that Mr. Rosebure had never been contacted by respondent and that Mr. Rosebure was dissatisfied with the representation. On October 4, 1988, Judge Block appointed Mr. Ryan as Mr. Rosebure’s attorney.
