A plaintiff who has been exposed to asbestos and develops thickening of the lungs or other non-malignant asbestos-related diseases may bring a first action upon discovering the condition, and may bring a second cause of action if and when he or she develops cancer. <em>Marinari </em>recognizes that since there is no medical connection between the non-malignant and malignant conditions, it is unwise to require an asbestos plaintiff to recover speculative future damages in one lawsuit. Busfield developed a non-malignant disease as a result of his exposure to asbestos, and thus he properly brought this first lawsuit.</p>

He posits that a present fear is distinct from a future risk, and that <em>Marinari </em>only meant to preclude the latter from the first lawsuit.

Just as all “past present and future asbestos-related mental anguish, inconvenience and distress” arising out of asbestosis or pleural thickening injuries may be fairly compensated in the initial asbestosis action, the same factors are relevant in establishing damages for the malignancy at the time it becomes actionable. No recovery may be had merely for the emotion and anguish arising from the possibility of the development of a malignancy.</blockquote>

Our learned colleague, Judge Del Sole, would argue that where pleural thickening is asymptomatic, the proper holding would be that plaintiff has suffered no damage, instead of the majority’s view that he has no cause of action. <em>Giffear, </em><a href="/pa-super/429/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="429 Pa.

He claims that as long as there is a physical manifestation of a disease, all emotional damages that it reasonably causes should be parasitic to the physical manifestation. The flaw in Busfield's argument as it pertains to him is simply that although he developed pleural thickening (a physical manifestation of asbestos exposure), he has not suffered, under <em>Giffear, </em>any legally cognizable injury to which emotional damages could attach. An interesting question, however, will be presented when an asbestos plaintiff does suffer legally cognizable physical damage as a result of a non-malignant disease, and then claims that the "fear” of cancer is a parasitic emotional damage. We will reserve resolution of this issue for another day.</p>

A review of the cases suggests that certain appellate expressions, upon occasion, have blurred two very distinct types of harm: (1) the <em>risk </em>of developing cancer which, it has been made clear, is not compensable in Pennsylvania, and (2) such loss of life’s pleasures as result from the <em>fear </em>of contracting cancer.
