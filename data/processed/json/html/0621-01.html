The court noted that Appellant had not received any counseling at the institution and did not know when he would be receiving such counseling. <em>Id. </em>3-4.

It requires the trial court to appoint a “qualified professional” who shall then counsel the “offending parent.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 5308(c). While the modifier “qualified” is not defined in the statute, it becomes superfluous if not read to require the professional to have expertise tied to the particular offense under assessment. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Realistically, whether the offending parent poses a threat of harm to the child cannot be assessed adequately without an understanding of that parent’s particular criminal conduct and the nature of the offense. Our laws recognize that sexual offenders in particular often present with unique mental health issues. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4 (requiring expert assessment of offenders who commit specified sexual offenses). Obviously, these same issues can gravely impact the best interests of a child in a custody setting. By requiring the trial court to “appoint” the qualified professional, the statute attempts to ensure that the court will receive the kind of information necessary to assess whether the offending parent, with his or her unique criminal conviction history, poses a threat of harm to the child. Section 5303(c) also plainly requires the trial court to hear testimony from the qualified professional regarding the course of counseling provided to the offending parent following the court appointment.</blockquote>

Following the testimony of these two witnesses, the court indicated that it did not plan to have any additional witnesses provide testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 19. Then, after both Appellant and Ms. Zgela stated that neither had any evidence or testimony to present, the court dictated its order dismissing Appellant’s petition. <em>Id. </em>at 19-24.</p>

Danysh, </em><a href="/a2d/833/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="833 A.2d 151" data-case-ids="9081677" data-case-paths="/a2d/833/0151-01">833 A.2d 151</a> (Pa.Super.2003), the court determined that it did not have the authority to compel the Department of Corrections to implement a counseling program for Appellant or to require it to allow an outside professional to provide the necessary counseling. We conclude, however, that the court’s reliance on <em>Danysh </em>to support its position that it lacked this authority is misplaced in that <em>Danysh </em>stands for the proposition that a court of common pleas does not have subject matter jurisdiction over suits filed against the Commonwealth or an agency like the Department of Corrections. The instant case was not filed against the Commonwealth or one of its agencies; rather it is a petition for visitation filed by a father against a mother. Moreover, nothing in the record before us reveals that the Department would not have cooperated with a request from the court to provide either the counseling or access to Appellant for counseling by an outside court-appointed professional as is required by the plain language of section 5303. This request was simply not made. In fact, Mr. Walmer’s comments at the hearing could very well be interpreted to mean that the Department of Corrections was gearing up to accommodate requests by the court for counseling of inmates as <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>required by section 5303. <em>See N.T., </em>6/26/08, at 3-4, 25.</p>

Indeed, Appellant contends that the court refused to appoint a qualified professional because the cost would have to be borne by York County. The court recognized that Pa.R.C.P.1915.8 (“Physical and Mental Examination of Persons”) provides guidance in custody cases when evaluations by appropriate experts are sought and noted that subsection (a)(1) requires the court to consider the allocation of costs, which in most cases means an allocation of the costs between the parties. Since Appellant is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the trial court explained that that status only “alleviates the necessity of him paying the costs of litigation, by which we take to mean filing fees, costs of transcripts, etc., (see Pa.R.Civ.P. 240(f)).” T.C.O. at 10.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The legislature could not have contemplated the professional’s appointment by the court to evaluate and counsel the parent in order to ensure the child’s safety and at the same time not allow for a mechanism to provide for the costs associated with the professional’s appointment. Under this scenario, the execution of the legislature’s <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>directive would be impossible. Although the statute does not identify a specific funding source, it appears from the testimony provided at the hearing by prison personnel that the Department of Corrections and the individual prisons employ the types of qualified professionals that the legislature intended would be used to provide the counseling and evaluations contemplated by the statute. Therefore, we conclude that the court should direct its request for counseling and evaluation to the prison authorities. If the prison authorities conclude that they are not obligated to accept the appointment by the court, they can raise this matter in another action.</p>

This concern is rather puzzling, since court-appointed professionals have long been utilized in various types of cases, including those dealing with the termination of parental rights, <em>In re Z.S.W., </em><a href="/a2d/946/0726-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="946 A.2d 726" data-case-ids="8382879" data-case-paths="/a2d/946/0726-01">946 A.2d 726</a> (Pa.Super.2008), and in custody matters, <em>Klos v.

However, the court relied on numerous factors it identified as interfering with its ability to comply with section 5303(c). We have concluded that the legislature has mandated that courts appoint such qualified professionals and have discussed the issues identified by the trial court as reasons for its inability to comply. However, we have concluded that those reasons are unavailing. Moreover, it is evident that Appellant has waited since 2004 for a final decision with regard to his petition for visitation. Although as previously noted, we make no prediction as to the final determination on Appellant’s petition, we are disturbed that this matter has been pending for five years and Appellant has as yet not been seen by a qualified professional.
