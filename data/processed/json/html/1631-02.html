T. Pace filed an application with the Railroad Commission under Chapter 13700. of the Laws of 1929 for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing him to operate a motor truck freight line between Jacksonville and Tallahassee and intermediate points, over State Road No. 1, on the established railroad freight rates. Upon the hearing, of which the petitioners were given due notice, it was made to appear by the evidence that the route applied for, over State Road No. 1, paralleled the line of the Seaboard Air Line Railway between the two cities named, and that said cities and all the intermediate points designated in said application were also located on said railway line, and were <a id="p1636" href="#p1636" data-label="1636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1636</a>already afforded adequate transportation facilities for both freight and express by the petitioners, the Seaboard Air Line Railway and the Railway Express Agency, who were fully equipped to satisfactorily handle all the business of this nature, existing or prospective, afforded by the territory in question. If this evidence was entitled to be considered by the Railroad Commission, it would appear that they should have, and probably would have, denied the application ; the applicant, in the face of this uncontradicted evidence, having failed to carry the burden which the law imposed upon him of showing that the public convenience and necessity demanded or warranted the granting of his proposed service. But the Commission manifestly did not consider this evidence, for they granted the application and ordered the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the operation of the freight truck service applied for. In fact, it appears that the Railroad Commissioners construed the statute as excluding from their consideration this matter of “other transportation facilities within the territory sought to be served" unless such other transportation facilities consisted of motor vehicle transportation facilities, for they have moved this Court to quash the writ of <em>certiorari </em>upon the ground <em>inter alia </em>that under Chapter 13700 they could not consider the effect which their action might have upon carriers by rail or express serving the same territory. This construction of the statute was in substance held to be erroneous in the recent case of Seaboard Air Line Railway Co. and Louisville &amp; Nashville Co. v. Wells et al., Railroad Commissioners, 130 So. R. 587, decided at the present term, but which decision had not been rendered at the time the motion to quash was filed in this proceeding, nor when the same was briefed and argued. It appears that, there is some conflict of authority on this point in other States having similar statutes, as is candidly <a id="p1637" href="#p1637" data-label="1637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1637</a>admitted by counsel for the Commission in his very able brief, but we are convinced that our prior decision is well founded, and that we should adhere thereto. In this connection, it might be noted that as to other motor transportation facilities, the evidence showed that certificates had already been issued to five freight truck lines for operation between Jacksonville and Baldwin, four between Jacksonville and Lake City, four between Jacksonville and Live Oak, three between Jacksonville and Madison and two between Jacksonville and Tallahassee at the time this application was filed, though none of them interposed any objection to the granting of Pace’s application.</p>

This claim was largely offset by evidence of similar service rendered by the express company in all the towns of any size located on the proposed route, and the showing made by statements signed by large numbers of business men and shippers in Monticello and Tallahassee to the effect that the service rendered by the express company was adequate and sufficient in every respect, prompt and regular, with facilities ample to meet the needs of any enlargement of such business; also the showing made as to the existing truck lines already serving the territory involved.</p>

Already vested with supervisory and regulatory power over the service and rates of railroad carriers and telegraph and telephone companies, the Commissioners are now, by this act, vested with similar powers over the business of motor vehicle transportation for compensation or as common carriers over the public highways, and in addition to this, the power of determining, except as to motor lines already in operation on April 19, 1929, whether the public convenience and necessity requires the granting of the right or privilege of operating new or additional motor lines for which <a id="p1639" href="#p1639" data-label="1639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1639</a>applications may be made to the commission. Thus the Railroad Commission has now become, in large measure, a general public utilities commission, vested with vast powers, affecting not only the public utilities mentioned, but also vitally affecting the public welfare of the entire State and all sections of the State. Furthermore, the new statute vests the commission with such judicial powers as are necessary to the performance of their duties thereunder. No apipeal from their orders or decisions is provided for by the act. Hence the only method of direct judicial review which exists is by means of. the issuance of <em>ceriiorari, </em>and appropriate proceedings thereunder. The power to issue such writs was vested in this Court by Section 5 of Article V of the Constitution of 1885.</p>

But we must not close our eyes to the fact that back of and underlying this immediate question is the ultimate and basic question whether “the public convenience and necessity” mentioned in the act, could reasonably be construed to require or justify the scrapping or serious crippling of the railroads of this State, where they are already rendering adequate service, and all that is reasonably necessary, to meet the needs of the territory in question. Can it be said that the statute requires it? If, under said statute, the Railroad Commission could not consider, in determining applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity made by auto transportation companies, the question whether adequate and .Sufficient transportation service was already being afforded by rail lines to the route and territory affected by such applications, as well as the effect <a id="p1640" href="#p1640" data-label="1640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1640</a>which the granting of such applications might have upon such rail transportation facilities, the ultimate result of the administration of the statute might be to transfer the business of carrying practically all passengers and freight (excepting perhaps such heavy, bulky, lowgrade and basic commodities as the motor vehicles could not handle) from the- rail lines, which own, maintain and pay taxes on their own tracks, road beds and rights of way, to motor transportation companies operating on and over the highways built and maintained at public expense, and which were constructed primarily for the use and benefit of the private citizens of the State, that is, the general public) in the ordinary course of life and business.</p>

Would such a result promote the “public convenience and necessity”? Can it be said that the statute, construed in the light of all its terms, will admit of any such construction? Surely “the public convenience and necessity,” which by its terms is made the primary objective of the statute, and the main one to be considered in determining applications made thereunder, would not be subserved by such a construction as that set up by the motion here made to quash the writ, <a id="p1641" href="#p1641" data-label="1641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1641</a>which would preclude any consideration whatever of existing railroad transportation.</p>

It may well be freely admitted that the statute assumes that the motor vehicle has its place in the general transportation system of the State. It is a popular and in many cases a convenient form of transportation, especially as to local transportation. And the statute manifestly contemplates that <em>where the public is not already adequately served by established carriers, either by rail or motor vehicles, and the public convenience and necessity demand it, </em>certificates authorizing motor transportation by bus or truck may be granted, in spite of the increased burden upon the public highways and the increased dangers to ordinary traffic thereby resulting.</p>

There may also be cases where even duplication of service may be required where the existing service is inadequate to meet the public needs, or to handle the rapidly increasing business offered by a new and growing field. See Pond on Public Utilities, Sec. 715. But there is no such showing here. This case presents an effort to secure authority to operate a truck line over a highway built and maintained at public expense, which highway runs side by side with a long established rail line for a distance of 170 miles, and thereby to haul freight in competition with the already reduced <a id="p1642" href="#p1642" data-label="1642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1642</a>freight and express business carried on over such rail line,, thus threatening the latter with a further serious reduction in its revenues; and this effort was made in the absence of any showing that the railway company, in connection with the express company, was inadequately equipped, or was; otherwise unable or failing to handle the business in such a. way as to reasonably meet the needs of the public; or, in the language of the statute, without any showing that the-"public convenience and necessity” required the granting of such additional service.</p>

There are also localities where several bus lines may seek to operate where the entire carrying business could be fully supplied by a less number. The motor bus operates upon the highway. The State of Vermont and the Federal Government have expended large sums of money in order to prépare the proper road bed to meet the new conditions of travel which the motor vehicle has called into being. This outlay, and the highways which have been provided by these means, are used by the motor bus in common with other motor vehicles and .horse-drawn vehicles without expense, save the small license fees which it pays to the local and Federal Government. Travel upon the principal highways of the state has increased to such an extent that, in many places, the highways are worn out so rapidly that it has become necessary to expend sums heretofore undreamed of for the construction of perma<a id="p1644" href="#p1644" data-label="1644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1644</a>nent highways of a stability sufficient to sustain the accumulated business, and the crowding of traffic in the principal places of business has become such that it is necessary to station traffic officers and set up monuments in the highways to regulate and control the direction and speed of the different kinds of vehicles. * * # The common carrier has always been considered subject to legislative control and regulation, having reference to the needs of the public, and when the legislature placed motor busses within this class it must have intended to subject the newly eonsti-. tuted common carriers to the same control and regulation as other members of the same class.

Public convenience alone does not authorize the issuing of a certificate. There must be public necessity as well.</p>
