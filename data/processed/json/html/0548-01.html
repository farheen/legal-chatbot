Nevertheless, we find that the settlement agreement was enforceable, albeit based upon slightly different terms from those set forth by the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>lower court. Finally, we agree with the lower court’s refusal to seal the record and find that action of the lower court does not invalidate the settlement agreement, as sealing of the record was not an essential term of the parties’ settlement agreement.

Second, it argues that its right to the offset cannot be waived, and, even if the offset is waivable, it was not waived under the facts of this case.

The Storms also claim that the defendants waived their right to raise their claims by failing to object to the Storms’ motion to approve the settlement of a minor’s claim.</p>

In October of 1997, Dr. O’Malley’s primary medical malpractice insurance carrier, Physicians Insurance Company (PIC), contacted the attorney it retained to represent the doctor in this matter, Linda Porr Sweeny, Esquire. PIC informed her that it would tender the maximum amount recoverable under its policy, $200,000. The CAT Fund, which was liable for any damage award beyond the doctor’s primary malpractice insurance policy limits, then assumed responsibility for the doctor’s defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>¶ 8 On January 21, 1998, Physicians Insurance Company became insolvent and a three-month stay of all proceedings, including the Storms’ action against Dr. O’Malley, ensued. PPCIGA was then deemed the insurer and assumed all rights, duties and obligations of PIC as if that insurer had not become insolvent, subject to certain maximum statutory limits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Attorney Sweeney forwarded a form letter to the Storms’ counsel on May 15, 1998, and informed the Storms of PPCI-GA’s involvement. She indicated that PPCIGA would assert its statutory offset right as set forth in § 1817(a) of the Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guarantee Act, which provides:</p>

Additionally, she informed the Storms that PPCIGA would seek to amend its new matter to assert its offset right as an affirmative defense. The Storms replied in writing that the offset issue was irrelevant because Dr. O’Malley would be personally liable for any gaps in coverage created by PPCIGA’s offsets. The Storms posited that the PPCIG Act did not protect the insured from being hable for the full amount of any judgment or settlement and, therefore, planned to object to discovery of any collateral insurance sources. Also, the Storms noted that the Act was possibly invalid since an attorney representing both PPCIGA and the insured would have a conflict of interest with the insured once it asserted PPCIGA’s offset right. Attorney Sweeny did not respond to this letter, nor did she file interrogatories. Attorney Sweeny then filed the new matter in which she raised PPCIGA’s statutory right to a setoff. However, when she did so, she failed to seek the leave of the trial court and, thus, failed to comply with our Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The parties reached a settlement that day. Specifically, Attorney Sweeny offered $801,858 to settle the Storms’ claims against Dr. O’Malley. The settlement structure provided that the Storms would receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount of $431,731 and the balance of $ 392,697 to purchase a bonded annuity. Upon the petition of the Storms, the court approved the settlement of Rachel’s claim in the amount of $806,358 upon the Storms’ petition.

Attorney Swee-ny claimed that the amount payable by PPCIGA represented the policy limits of Dr. O’Malley’s former policy less medical expenses of $26,165, which were paid by other insurers on behalf of the Storms. The release also required that the Storms agree to sealing of the record.</p>

The court granted PPCIGA and the CAT Fund’s motions and then heard oral arguments on the motion to compel settlement. Ultimately, it granted the Storms’ motion to compel settlement, denied appellees’ request to offset the Storms’ recovery by the amount they recovered from other insurers and refused to seal the record. Dr. O’Malley, PPCIGA and the CAT Fund then filed timely appeals to our court.</p>

The Storms argue that the settlement as approved by the lower court should be affirmed since the appellants did not file objections to their petition to approve the settlement of a minor’s claim. The Storms filed their petition on or about July 2, 1998, and the court approved the settlement by order dated July 15, 1998. Appellants never objected to the petition.</p>

In this manner, the risk of loss due to the insolvency of any one insurer is spread out over all member insurance companies and their policyholders. <em><a href="/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20179" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="627 A.2d 179">Id.</a> </em>at § 991.1810. In effect, every time PPCIGA pays a claim, every member insurance company is paying part of the claim. The Act therefore seeks to lessen the financial burden on the insurance industry by preventing duplication of recovery. As Justice Zap-pala stated in reference to the prior version of the instant non-duplication provision: “This provision reflects the legislature’s intent that fiscally solvent insurers, which are contractually obligated to pay a claim, be the primary source of payment.” <em>Bethea v. Forbes, </em><a href="/pa/519/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="519 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1813554" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0422-01">519 Pa. 422</a>, 428, <a href="/pa/519/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="519 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1813554" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0422-01">548 A.2d 1215</a>, 1218 (1988). Given the legislative intent of this statutory scheme, we find the plaintiffs’ entitlement to the disbursement of settlement funds is not controlled by common law contract principles. Rather, to the extent there was insurance coverage, the right to payment constitutes nothing more than a claim against an insolvent insurer by virtue of having a claim against a tortfeasor who was insured by that insurer. Furthermore, a plaintiff who has a claim under the defendants’ insurance policy, which remains unpaid at the time of insolvency, is considered as having a “covered claim” under § 991.1802 (defining covered claim), and thus falls within the parameters of § 991.1817 (Non-duplication of recovery).</blockquote>

We find the legislative intent of the Act precludes such an anomalous result. The plaintiffs argue that if the insureds are not personally liable then the plaintiffs will bear the loss, and as between an innocent victim and a tortfeasor the risk of loss should be placed on the tortfeasor. Despite the facial appeal of the argument, a closer examination of how the Act serves to spread the loss belies the plaintiffs’ contention. In fact it is not the plaintiffs who bear the loss, rather, if any loss can be said to have occurred, it is the solvent insurers who paid plaintiffs’ claims under the other sources of insurance, which the Act requires to be exhausted first. In each of the three cases under consideration the plaintiffs will receive the full amount of either their settlements or jury verdict, it just will not necessarily come from PPCIGA or the doctors.</blockquote>

On the other hand, there was no significant issue of public interest or grave public concern demonstrated.

No public interest would have been served by making the settlement public, but much damage could have been done to the minor in this case as well as to Dr. O’Malley, his reputation and his position in the community. Furthermore, the sealing of the record in this case is in keeping with the court’s general policy to encourage the settlement of medical malpractice cases. If defendants involved with a cause of action against a minor are made aware of the fact that it is unlikely that they are going to be able to keep the settlement private, they will be more inclined to take their chances with a trial. Settlement will no longer be as attractive because there will be no guarantee that adverse publicity can be avoided.</blockquote>

However, we find that the lower court erred when it held that either PPCI-GA or the CAT Fund was responsible to pay that amount for which PPCIGA was entitled to a statutory setoff. Rather, we find that PPCIGA is entitled to reduce its obligation by its statutory setoff, and the CAT Fund cannot be compelled to make up for that amount by essentially dropping below its threshold of liability. In addition, we conclude that Dr. O’Malley may not be held personally liable for the amount of the setoff. In so ruling, we are cognizant of the importance of the statutory scheme which our Legislature enacted to protect innocent tort victims and insureds from the unpleasant ramifications of insolvent insurers. Despite the Storms’ protestations to the contrary, they have recovered the full amount of their agreed-upon settlement. Were we to direct PPCIGA or the CAT Fund to pay the settlement without regard to PPCIGA’s statutory setoff, the Storms’ ultimate recovery would not change as their health care insurer, as subrogee, would be entitled to recover a like sum from them. Finally, we find that the CAT Fund’s proposed confidentiality clause was not a part of the parties’ settlement agreement, and that the lower court did not err in denying Dr. O’Malley’s motion to seal the record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">13</a>
