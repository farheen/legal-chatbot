Upon inspecting her bank account statement dated May 4, 2006, original plaintiff Sharon Mullen (“Mullen”) discovered that numerous unauthorized checks were paid from her account held with defendant RBS Citizens, N.A (“Citizens”). The unauthorized checks were made payable to either William Taylor (“Taylor”) or Mary Glover (“Glover”). Mullen contacted Taylor, and he confessed that he had stolen the checks from Mullen while he was repairing a window in her residence. He stated that Glover was not complicit. When Mullen spoke with Glover, she denied knowledge that the checks made payable to her had been unauthorized. Both individuals requested that Mullen not contact the police, but allow them to repay the amount taken.</p>

A total of twenty-seven checks were cashed, amounting to $12,770.00.</p>

Evans informed Mullen that for her to be reimbursed for the unauthorized payments by Citizens, she would need to file an affidavit and report the forgery to the police. Mullen told Evans that because Taylor had small children and she did not want to upset his family, she wanted to give him a chance to repay the money before filing a complaint with the police. Evans agreed not to process any claim at that point, but spoke with an individual in Citizens’ corporate fraud and security department, informing him that Mullen had reported forgeries to Evans. After informing Citizens of the initial fraud, Mullen continued to contact the bank, speaking with Evans in person or via the telephone a number of times over the next two months, to update Evans on her progress as she sought restitution from Taylor. During one conversation, Mullen asked Evans whether it was reasonable for her to wait some weeks for Taylor’s relatives to obtain money from a 401K account to repay her. Evans responded that it could take some weeks to obtain cash from a 401K account.</p>

Evans forwarded the necessary paperwork to the appropriate bank department.

The letter stated that “unknown person... forged [Mullen’s] name on several checks.” Mullen brought the letter to Evans, who attempted to help Mullen by making several telephone calls to various offices at Citizens informing them that certain statements in the letter were incorrect. Citizens purported to have reopened the case. On October 5, 2006, Citizens again denied Mullen’s claim, this time noting that affidavits were not filed in “a timely manner.”</p>

Citizens did not appeal this ruling.</p>

There is no evidence, nor does Evans allege anywhere in the record, that she informed Mullen that the claim against the bank would be lost if the necessary documents were not filed within thirty days. When she forwarded Mullen’s claim to Citizens on July 21, 2006, Evans did not state that the police report and affidavit had needed to be filed within thirty days of Mullen’s receipt of the relevant account statement. Evans admitted that she likely lost track of how many days had passed since Mullen had first contacted her regarding the fraud. At a trial of Mullen’s G.L.c. 93A claim, a fact finder would be warranted in determining that Evans, the individual in charge of meeting with customers regarding incidents of fraud at the Milton Village branch of Citizens, in processing and forwarding Mullen’s initial claim to Citizens, and then, after Citizens denied the claim, in assisting in resubmitting the claim with the belief that the denial had been in error, believed that the claim was good and filed in an otherwise timely manner.</p>

A finding would be warranted that nothing in the text of the agreement, or in Evans’ or any other Citizens’ bank employee’s behavior or direct statements to her, would have led Mullen to know what the proper process was, even <em>though she </em>relied on the bank to inform her of it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">6</a>
