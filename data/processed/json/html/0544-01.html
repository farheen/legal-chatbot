The project involved running cable alongside high voltage lines, from tower to tower, between Delmarva’s electrical substations. The Henkels crew that was assigned to a section between the Cecil substation and Colora substation consisted of a foreman, several journeymen linemen, several apprentice linemen and a crane operator.

This statute obliges appellants to have filed the instant action in Maryland within three years of the date of the decedent’s death, specifically, before October 28, 2000. At the time that this action was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, it was still timely in Maryland. However, rather than initiating the action in Maryland, appellants exercised their constitutionally guaranteed right of appeal to this Court. While this appeal was pending, the limitation period expired, thereby barring the action in Maryland. While appellees have asserted in their supplemental brief that they are willing to waive any statute of limitations defense, our review of Maryland law reveals that the three year period governing wrongful death actions is not a statute of limitations, but rather a condition precedent to maintaining the action. <em>See: Waddell v.
