Buyer and Seller then met at Buyer’s home to discuss the transaction. The parties continued to negotiate concerning the purchase of the. system over the next few months.

The initial contract price was $21,533.82. The contract did not include the written notice of the Buyer’s right to cancel as required by section 201-7. Over the course of several months, Seller installed the system in Buyer’s home.

Buyer answered by denying that any further amounts were due because of the inadequacies of the system and filed a counterclaim in which he invoked the provisions of section 201-7. The parties ultimately filed cross motions for summary judgment on Buyer’s counterclaim under the UTPCPL. On June 14, 1995 the trial court entered an order denying Buyer’s motion, granting Seller’s motion and dismissing Buyer’s UTPCPL counterclaim.

The court reasoned that since Buyer is a sophisticated consumer who himself initiated contact with Seller and who conducted lengthy negotiations over the purchase of a very expensive product, Buyer is simply not the type of consumer that section 201-7 seeks to protect. The court found little or no significance to the fact that Seller made repeated contacts with Buyer at Buyer’s home. The court reasoned that these contacts were necessary for the Seller to be able to customize the audio visual system to Buyer’s home.</p>

    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[189,346,750,468]]]'>There is no question but that a fair reading of the language of the statute compels the conclusion that Buyer is entitled to the protections of section 201-7. The statute affords the right to cancel to any consumer who agrees to purchase goods or services with a value of $25 or more “as a result of or in connection with” contact between the seller and the consumer at the consumer’s home. The statute provides for no exceptions.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[187,838,751,421]]]'>The Buyer in this case falls precisely within this language. Here, Seller expressly admitted in his answer to Buyer’s counterclaim that Seller engaged in repeated contacts with Buyer at his home and that the sale of the audio visual system either resulted from or was consummated in connection with those contacts. The value of the system clearly exceeded the statutory minimum of $25.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[186,1284,751,600]]]'>The statutory language provides protection to all buyers where the seller “makes a contact with or call on the buyer at his residence[.]” It is unfortunate, but this legislative language clearly provides a right to cancel to all buyers even if the buyer is sophisticated, in no way deceived or pressured by the Seller, and takes adequate time to reflect before agreeing to the transaction. We apply the statutory language as written and it is for the legislature to modify the language if it intended to protect a more limited class of consumers.</p>

As the trial court found, section 201-7 appears to be primarily directed to providing protection to a consumer who falls prey to a seller who contacts the consumer at his or her home and consummates a sales transaction before the consumer has adequate time to reflect on the wisdom of the purchase. In order to guarantee that the consumer will not be obligated to proceed with the transaction until he or she has adequate time to reflect, the statute provides a three day period in which the buyer may cancel without incurring any obligation.</p>

There is no evidence that Buyer was compelled to purchase the audio visual system because of high pressure sales tactics employed by Seller at Buyer’s home. However, the issue presented for decision is not whether we consider Buyer to be deserving of the protections afforded by section 201-7. The issue is whether the language of the statute as drafted by the legislature can be construed to afford a person in Buyer’s position the protections of the statute. If the statutory language, fairly construed, encompasses Buyer, then Buyer must be accorded the benefits of the statute whether we think he merits them or not.</p>

The Attorney General also directs our attention to the Federal Trade Commission regulation which provides <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>a federal right to cancel similar to that provided by section 201-7. <a href="/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20429.1" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="16 C.F.R. § 429.1">16 C.F.R. § 429.1</a>.</p>

The statute itself simply does not permit us to engage in this analysis. The legislature has used clear language. In doing so, the legislature did not exclude transactions where negotiations occurred, or where the initial contact was made by the buyer, or even where a consideration of all the foregoing factors argued against application of section 201-7.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[230,1071,754,1039]]]'>Lastly, we must point out that a comparison of the language of the federal right to cancel regulation with the language of section 201-7 lends even further support to our broad reading of the Pennsylvania statute. First, the federal right to cancel regulation is expressly applicable only to “door-to-door” transactions. <em><a href="/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20429.1" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="16 C.F.R. § 429.1">Id.</a> </em>Moreover, the federal right to cancel is expressly inapplicable to a list of transactions including, for example, transactions consummated entirely by mail or telephone and transactions where the buyer contacts the seller and requests that he come to the buyer’s home to repair personal property. <em><a href="/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20429.1" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="16 C.F.R. § 429.1">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20429.1" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="16 C.F.R. § 429.1">note 1</a>. In contrast, the Pennsylvania right to cancel provision does not specifically refer only to “door-to-door” transactions, and there are no specifically exempted transactions. If the Pennsylvania legislature intended to limit the applicability of section 201-7, it must do so expressly, as Congress did.</p>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[232,2130,754,278]]]'>We find no language in the statute that permits us to exclude the transaction between Buyer and Seller from the scope of section 201-7.

Shortly after disposition of the summary judgment motions, the parties entered into a stipulation in which they agreed that they would not proceed to a trial of the remaining issues in the case and would instead pursue the pending appeal of the trial court’s order granting partial summary judgment for Seller. They further agreed that pending the disposition of the appeal, Buyer would escrow the remaining amounts Seiler claimed to be due. Lastly, the parties agreed that if this court holds that the UTPCPL applies to this transaction, Buyer will retain the system as installed and will receive a refund of the amounts he has thus far paid Seller. If this court holds to the contrary, however. Buyer will release to Seller the escrowed funds. In either event, the parties stipulated that the balance of the action will be marked settled, discontinued and ended. Thus, this court's disposition of the issue raised in this appeal will finally resolve the entire dispute between the parties.</p>
