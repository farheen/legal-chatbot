On January 13, 2006, Employer filed a petition to modify or suspend Claimant’s benefits based on a release to return to work by John R. Frankeny II, M.D., and a labor market survey establishing Claimant’s earning capacity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Claimant filed an answer to that petition, denying the allegations, and hearings were held before a WCJ.

Clark utilized Claimant’s job application with Employer to determine Claimant’s vocational and educational background, and she reviewed medical records she received from Dr. Frankeny. Clark prepared a transferable skills analysis and performed a labor market survey showing eight sedentary positions. Clark personally viewed the positions being performed and prepared job analyses for Dr. Frankeny’s review. Dr. Frankeny approved all of the jobs for Claimant. The highest paid position was a Mail Filer job with Capital Tax Collection, which paid $376.60 per week. (WCJ’s Findings of Fact, No. 4.)</p>

Leslie, a vocational expert who, at the request of Claimant’s counsel, reviewed Clark’s labor market survey and interviewed Claimant. Leslie spent a total of two hours meeting with the eight employers in the labor market survey, and much of Leslie’s testimony was based on information he gained from third parties and, as such, is hearsay. Leslie did not prepare any job analyses for the eight positions in order to refute Clark’s job analyses. Moreover, although Leslie testified that Claimant does have some earning capacity, Leslie did not attempt to locate any suitable positions for Claimant.

However, Clark also provided the range of weekly salaries as $140.00 to $376.60. <em>(Id.) </em>That portion of Clark’s survey showing that Claimant could have earned $376.60 per week in the Mail Filer job constitutes substantial evidence to support the WCJ’s finding that Claimant has such an earning capacity. <em>See Select Security, Inc. v.
