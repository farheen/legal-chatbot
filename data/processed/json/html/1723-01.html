This construction of the statute has been consistently followed by this Court since that time, but so far as I have been able to find it has not been extended in its operation beyond the immediate grantee in a quit-claim; nor do I think that logic or reason requires its extension. To further extend the rule would in effect amount to the adoption of a new rule, which new rule would, to my mind, work great injustice and hardship, as is illustrated by the facts in Rabinowitz v. Houk, as well as in the present case. It may be that, under the doctrine of <em>Stare decisis, </em>it is better in many instances to stick to an old rule, especially in eases <a id="p1730" href="#p1730" data-label="1730" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1730</a>where the old rule has become a rule of property, than to adopt a new rule, even though the new be better founded in reason than the old. But the case of Rabinowitz v. Houk did not set aside the old rule. It merely restricted it strictly within the limits .to which it had been previously applied by this Court. When it comes to the adoption of a new rule of statutory construction, or when an effort is made to extend an old rule beyond the limits hitherto recognized, the courts may well consider the logic, reason, justice and wisdom, as well as the soundness of the public policy involved, in the step they are about to take.</p>

Lake was now being presented for the first time, the writer is frank to say that he would consider it a very debatable question. With all due deference, candor compels me to say that I am doubtful of the wisdom of the rule of statutory construction therein adopted, for the reasons so ably pointed out in the opinions of Justices Field, Brewer and Gray respectively in the three decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States cited in Rabinowitz v. Houk, and the opinion of Justice Sanborn in Boynton v. Haggart, <a href="/f/120/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="120 F. 819" data-case-ids="3822419" data-case-paths="/f/120/0819-01">120 Fed. 819</a>, as well as for the reasons set forth in 27 R. C. L. 731-733 and cases cited. The statute says nothing about purchasers under quitclaim deeds. It purports to protect as against unrecorded deeds all subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration and without notice,- with qualification. To arbitrarily assume by way of a rule of statutory construction that in no case can a purchaser who takes by quitclaim deed be a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value and without notice, without regard to the facts of the particular case, is in my humble judgment going too far. However, though the decisions on the subject in other jurisdictions are various and conflicting, the rule adopted in Snow v. Lake has been so long recognized in this State, having become in a <a id="p1731" href="#p1731" data-label="1731" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1731</a>way a rule of property, it should doubtless continue to be followed by the courts, leaving any possible change therein to legislative action. But I am constrained to believe that the rule thus adopted in Snow v. Lake should be strictly confined within the limits stated in that case; that is, it should be restricted in its operation to the immediate grantee in a quit claim deed.</p>
    <p id="b727-5" data-blocks='[["BL_727.5",727,[228,939,1102,1272]]]'>But it is contended that the rule cannot be so confined, because, if the grantor in the quit-claim had previously conveyed his title to another, even though by an unrecorded deed, the title passed entirely out of him, and therefore the grantee in the quit-claim took no title whatever, nor did any of those claiming under him. This argument proves too-much if sound, it would operate likewise against a subsequent grantee by <em>warranty </em>deed from a grantor who had previously executed a warranty deed to some other person apd. which prior deed had been withheld from the public records and of which the subsequent grantee had no notice. It would practically nullify the recording statute. See Boynton v. Haggart, <a href="/f/120/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="120 F. 819" data-case-ids="3822419" data-case-paths="/f/120/0819-01">120 Fed. 819</a>. Furthermore, this argument fails to give full force and effect to the significant language of the statute, which is that “No conveyance * * * of real property * * * shall be good and effectual in law or equity against * * * subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration and without notice, unless the same be recorded according to law.” This means that a deed, though good <em>inter partes, </em>so long as it is withheld from the public records it is not good and effectual as against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice; that, in effect, as to him it is ineffectual to convey the absolute title out of the grantor, by reason of the failure to record it.</p>

In the course of his opinion, Mr. Justice Wescott said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b728-5" data-blocks='[["BL_728.5",728,[321,952,1019,1357]],["BL_729.1",729,[307,573,1016,293]]]'>“We take it, therefore, that there is no difference in principle between such a deed by an heir and such a deed by an administrator. Some of the cases upon this subject hold that the second deed is inoperative, because, in the view they take of it, after the first deed nothing was left to descend to the heir, or to pass as an asset to the administrator. We do not think this is correct, for the reason that <em>an unrecorded deed does not, under the law, vest an absolute estate. Under the recording statutes., the absolute title rests with the grantor in-abeyance, and does not irrevocably pass to the grantee until the deed is recorded. There is such an estate left in the grantor as, upon the recording of a subsequent conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, divests the entire estate passed by the prior unrecorded deed. If the intestate were alive, his second deed to such a purchaser for value would pass the estate. </em>Does the estate upon his death pass absolutely to the first grantee! Unquestionably not, for what he has goes either to the heir or administrator. The statutes of descents and distribution direct nothing of the kind, upon the death of the intestate, his heir, or in the absence of debts, his administrator, viewed in reference to the probate court, upon exhaustion of personal assets, stands according to the true intent and meaning of the statutes controlling the subject of intestate estates and descents, in the same <a id="p1733" href="#p1733" data-label="1733" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1733</a>place as the intestate. The administrator is his legal representative, with defined powers, and, so far as this matter is concerned, the power and estate which 'existed, in the intestate before his death passes to his administrator, acting under the order of a court having jurisdiction.</blockquote>

Looking to the intention and object of the Legislature in passing .the recording statutes, it is clear that the evil which they intended to remedy attaches as well to apparent ownership in the heir or administrator, as in the deceased intestate when alive. <em>The object of this statute is to make patent, to disclose to the world the holder of the legal title, in order that purchasers for value might be protected against the secret deeds of the grantor, and the law protects the party who expends Kis money on the basis of this apparent ownership. </em>In the case of his death, his heir or his administrator, with a decree of the court authorizing a sale, is the apparent owner of the legal title, and it is equally as. important and equally as just that the public should be allowed'to deal with them as with the original grant- or if living.

From any allegations to the contrary such has been the status of the lands since 1887 when the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund conveyed them to the Florida Southern Railway. -That Corporation conveyed the lands in fee- simple to Jacob ‘Edwards on May 5, 1888, which deed was recorded in October of that year in ■ DeSoto County' where the lands, are located. In 1892 Edwards and wife conveyed to Charles E. Sumner by warranty deed, who- in November, 1916, conveyed by deed to Samuel C.

It is because he knows that the grantor is unwilling to convey the title in the usual way by an ordinary deed of conveyance of the land but agrees to convey only his right, title or interest therein, whatever it may be, that puts him, the grantee in such a conveyance, upon notice of outstanding titles and destroys the element of bona tides and lack of notice within the meaning of the statute.</p>

In those jurisdictions where it is held that the grantee in a quitclaim deed takes the property over grantees in prior unrecorded deeds and is thus entitled to the protection of the recording statute the argument in support of the rule rests upon the assumption that such grantee believes his grantor to have title, or some alienable interest in the land; that the grantee has paid a valuable consideration for it; that he is a purchaser in good faith and without notice from those having an apparent title to the land or that believing his vendor to be the owner he naturally supposes that he' has obtained all there is to-sell and should not be made to suffer merely because -of' the inartistic-manner in which the deed to him appears-' to be drawn.
