But, as I read the case, the critical fact occurred before 1776. Thus a warrant was given by Penn and the land was surveyed in 1704 but formal deed was not made. The purpose of the warrant and survey <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>was clear: to give the land for the use of the inhabitants of the Town of New Castle “to lie in common.” The formal deed given in 1791 confirms this and the Supreme Court held that the entire transaction created a charitable trust.
