In that case, we held that in view of Section Nine of Article Twelve of the Constitution requiring all moneys available to the Board of Public Instruction to be used solely for the support of public free schools said- board could not be held. liable if it failed to require contractors to post the indemnity bond required by Chapter 10035, Acts of 1925, Laws of Florida (Section 5397 Comp. Gen. Laws of 1927). In other words, a judgment secured for failure to post said bond could not be satisfied from public school funds.</p>

The Phillips case was grounded exclusively on tort for failure to exact the bond required of the contractor by Chapter 10035, Acts of 1925,. Laws of Florida. The instant case was grounded on tort, novation and implied contract for materials furnished at the request of the Board for public school buildings. In the Phillips case, no indemnity bond was offered while in the case at bar, the contractor, Marshall Jackson Company, Incorporated, presented and offered a good and sufficient indemnity bond which was declined by the Board of Public Instruction because of the cost thereof, said Board having <a id="p1654" href="#p1654" data-label="1654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1654</a>obligated itself to bear said cost under its contract with Marshall Jackson Company, Incorporated.</p>

R. 521, this Court in effect held that although there was 'no express statute providing that a Board of Public Instruction may sue or be sued, yet when the legislature. created such a Board a corporation and authorized it to contract, borrow money, undertake obligations and deal with the business world as other legal entities, there necessarily follows the implication that it may be sued in appropriate actions ex <em>contractu </em>upon obligations lawfully incurred, the payment of which would not involve an unauthorized disbursement of the county school fund under Section Nine of Article Twelve of the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b650-6" data-blocks='[["BL_650.6",650,[307,1367,1103,950]],["BL_651.1",651,[215,570,1104,303]]]'>Under our Constitution, county school funds and special tax school district funds are deafly distinguished. Section Nine of Article Twelve defines and appropriates the county school fund, Sections Ten and Eleven of Article Twelve define and appropriate special tax school district funds and Section Seventeen of Article Twelve provides for and appropriates the proceeds of special tax school district bonds. All special tax school district funds whether derived through Sections Ten and Eleven or Section Seventeen of Article Twelve of the Constitution are. disbursed by the Board of Public Instruction of the county. Section 589 Rev. Gen. Stats, of 1920 (Section 731 Comp. Gen. Laws of 1927), Chapter 11699, Acts of 1925, Laws of Monda. All contracts on behalf of special tax school districts must also be made by the Board of Public Instruction of the county. 1’n this situation, it follows that any suit to recover from a special tax school district must be brought against the Board of Public Instruction on behalf of or as representing said special tax school district. County school funds are <a id="p1655" href="#p1655" data-label="1655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1655</a>not liable for the obligation of a special tax school district,, neither are special tax school district funds liable for the-obligation of the county. The record in the case at bar-shows conclusively that such remedy as the plaintiff may have is against Tarpon Springs, Dunedin and Largo special tax school districts.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[215,902,1103,701]]]'>Our lawmakers, both constitutional and statutory, have gone a great way in throwing safeguards around the application of the public school fund. Section Nine of Article-Twelve of the Constitution ordains that county school funds can be used only for public free school purposes while special tax school district bond funds such as are involved in this ease must be applied to the “exclusive use of public-free schools” as required by Section Seventeen, Article-Twelve, of the Constitution. Acquiring sites, erecting and equipping public school buildings would without question be a public free school purpose. Persons dealing with boards of public instruction are on notice of these provisions of the law and any contract for the pledge of public-school funds not contemplated hereby is <em>ultra vires.</em>

Chapter 11699, Acts of 1925, Laws of Florida, authorized the Board of Public Instruction of Pinellas County to raise the funds and contract for the school buildings in which the materials were used that defendant in error now seeks to recover for.. Counts seven, nine, and eleven of the declaration allege the furnishing of the materials, the place and amount thereof’ and that a good and sufficient surety bond was tendered the-Board of Public Instruction which was declined but in doing so the said board promised to pay the plaintiff any damages sustained by it on account of defendant (Board <a id="p1656" href="#p1656" data-label="1656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1656</a>of Public Instruction) failing to accept and require said bond. All these facts were admitted by the demurrer to the declaration. The judgment is in the full amount claimed against the three districts with interest thereon but the part each district is liable for may be readily determined from the declaration. Any bond funds remaining in Tarpon Springs, Dunedin, or Largo, special tax school districts that were voted for the construction of the school buildings therein as brought in question may now be subjected to the payment of the judgment secured. The' judgment cannot, however, be satisfied as a whole from any aggregate amount held by the Board of Public Instruction belonging to these special tax school districts but each district must bear that amount of the judgment as is claimed for materials furnished it as alleged in counts seven, nine, and eleven of the declaration. The public school fund of the county is in no way liable nor can one special tax school district be required to pay any part of the obligation of another special tax school district.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[292,1534,1099,443]]]'>We therefore conclude that counts seven, nine, and eleven qf the declaration state a cause of action against the Board of Public Instruction of Pinellas County as representing or on behalf of Tarpon Springs, Dunedin and Largo special tax school districts in said county and that recovery may be had in the manner stated in this opinion. There was no evidence to support counts one to five, inclusive, of the declaration. Other assignments of error have been examined but became immaterial, hence they are not treated.</p>
