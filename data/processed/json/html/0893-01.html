    <p id="b344-12" data-blocks='[["BL_344.12",344,[245,1966,1317,84]]]'>With these principles in mind, we will briefly review the basis of the decision of the tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>
    <p id="b344-13" data-blocks='[["BL_344.13",344,[241,2064,1321,344]]]'>The patent to McCurdy discloses a photographic film roll, with covering portions or leaders attached thereto. The specification states that they are “wound upon a spool, the heads or flanges of which serve, together with the enveloping section or covering jmrtion of the film, to exclude the light therefrom at the edges ”; and further, that the leader “ should be of a length sufficient to wind one or more times about the coiled image-receiving portion.”</p>
    <p id="b345-3" data-blocks='[["BL_345.3",345,[123,249,1324,142]]]'>
      <a id="p895" href="#p895" data-label="895" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*895</a>This patent, however, does not relate to films for motion-picture cameras, and the film leaders described therein have no apertures which are necessary for use in such cameras.</p>
    <p id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[124,400,1323,244]]]'>Bianchi shows a leader, as does McCurdy, but it also shows perforations of the same, as does appellant. The commissioner found that “ by the repeated winding of the leaders or extension, the said perforations in and next to the sensitized portion of the film would necessarily be covered, thereby excluding the light.”</p>
    <p id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[127,651,1322,294]]]'>Appellant, however, contends that Bianchi does not state that his extension or leader is repeatedly wound upon the film; that there is nothing in his specification or drawings to suggest that the leader would be “ repeatedly wound ” upon itself, and that the sole object of Bianchi was to prevent edge fog due to light passing in between the film edges and the flanges of the spool.</p>
    <p id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.6",345,[127,953,1321,594]]]'>We agree with appellant that Bianchi only claimed invention in providing his film with a marginal strip of coloring matter, but we can not agree with appellant that Bianchi’s specification does not disclose the device here in issue. As already stated, he does disclose the leader with perforated edges, and if it was specifically shown that the leader was long enough to be wound upon itself a sufficient number of times to prevent light from entering through the apertures in the leader to the film, it would have to be conceded that this feature of appellant’s device was fully and completely disclosed. But we think that while the length of the leader is not stated, the specification of Bianchi clearly implies such a length of leader as will accomplish the same result as is claimed by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b345-7" data-blocks='[["BL_345.7",345,[168,1553,669,43]]]'>In his specification, Bianchi states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b345-8" data-blocks='[["BL_345.8",345,[126,1624,1319,324]]]'>It will be seen that in tlie leader O, near the end, gaps or slots are cut in line with the perforations <em>a, </em>so that when these gaps reach the roller D the latter ceases to feed the film just as the end of the ribbon is reached. This prevents the l-ibbon being torn by the continued turning of the roller through the mediuni of the crank handle; at the same time the winding- spool may be continued in movement to take up any slack and wind the film as tightly as desired. It is then safe to seal up and remove the spool in daylight <em>as the leader protects the outside of the film,; </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>
    <p id="b345-9" data-blocks='[["BL_345.9",345,[122,1973,1323,539]]]'>It is obvious that without repeated windings of the leader upon itself it could not be said that it “ protects the outside of the film,” and without such repeated windings it is likewise obvious that Bianchi’s invention would be of no value whatever. To protect the film “ against fog creeping inward from the exposed edges ” would accomplish nothing unless the film was also protected from light penetrating through the apertures of the leader, and when he states that after being wound the “ leader protects the outside of the film,” it is clear that he had in mind a sufficient number of windings to accomplish that purpose, and this would be obvious to any one skilled in the art.</p>
    <p id="b346-3" data-blocks='[["BL_346.3",346,[246,227,1317,95]]]'>
      <a id="p896" href="#p896" data-label="896" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*896</a>• We do not think that appellant has established error upon the part of the Commissioner and his decision is <em>affirmed.</em>
