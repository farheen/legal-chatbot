While Claimant was on layoff status,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Employer made SUB payments to Claimant. Following hearings, the WCJ granted Claimant’s Claim Petition, awarding Claimant on-going benefits and retroactive benefits for past disability. (WCJ’s Dec. 27, 1994, Conclusions of Law, No. 2.)</p>

Paladino testified that SUB pay is a benefit, funded solely by Employer, which Employer provides to its hourly employees pursuant to the Supplementary Unemployment Benefits Agreement, a negotiated collective bargaining agreement (Agree<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>ment).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (WCJ’s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 1; R.R. at 159R.) Paladino explained that employees accrue half a credit unit for each work week, including weeks they are not working, so long as they are receiving pay from Employer. (WCJ’s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, Nos. 2, 8; R.R. at 160R, 273R.) Paladino stated that Claimant was accruing credits while receiving benefits and had accrued the maximum of 209 credit units, of which Claimant had used ninety-six credit units.

(WCJ’s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 3; R.R. at 161R.) Paladino explained that Employer makes SUB payments only to those employees who are on layoff status as defined in the Agreement; if an employee is receiving workers’ compensation benefits or sickness and accident benefits, SUB pay does not apply. (WCJ’s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 3; R.R. at 161R-62R, 274R.) Therefore, Paladino testified that, if Employer had paid Claimant workers’ compensation benefits immediately, Employer would not have made SUB payments to Claimant. (WCJ’s Sept. 17, 1997, Findings of Fact, No. 4.) However, because Claimant was originally laid off from work and, later, was awarded workers’ compensation benefits retroactively, Employer paid Claimant a total of $37,927.96 in SUB pay from March 1993 through January 22, 1995. (WCJ’s Sept. 17,1997, Findings of Fact, Nos. 4-5.)</p>
    <p id="b188-9" data-blocks='[["BL_188.10",188,[1017,564,751,632]]]'>Based on the Agreement, the WCJ concluded that Claimant was not entitled to receive both SUB pay and workers’ compensation benefits. The WCJ stated that to conclude otherwise would allow Claimant to receive a double recovery, which the Agreement did not intend. Accordingly, the WCJ credited Employer for the SUB payments made to Claimant during the period that Claimant was entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits. Claimant appealed the WCJ’s decision to the WCAB.</p>

Here, Employer’s SUB plan states that the purpose of the plan is to “supplement State System Benefits and not to replace or duplicate them.” (R.R. at 90R.) From this language, we discern that the SUB payments are not intended to be in place of, or in lieu of, compensation. <em>See </em>WbbsteR’s Third New International DictionaRY 1925 (1986) (defining replace as “to put in place of’). In addition, Paladino testified that only those nonworking employees on layoff status, such as Claimant, are eligible for SUB pay. Here, Claimant was medically restricted and awaiting suitable employment and, thus, was laid off. Clearly, that does not mean that Claimant was unable to labor. Therefore, because the SUB payments were not intended to be in place of compensation and because they were not paid based on Claimant’s inability to labor, Employer is not entitled to a credit. <em>See Toborkey.</em>

The fact remains that, here, Claimant, whose absence relates to a compensable injury, was forced to deplete ninety-six credit units of an exhaustible benefit which would otherwise have remained available to him in the event of a future lay-off. <em>See Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board v.
