At the time, Rhode Island was experiencing a severe winter storm; it had been snowing almost the entire day and the storm continued into the night. The plaintiffs friend drove the pair to the establishment and parked his car in the parking lot. While the storm continued to produce a mixture of freezing rain and snow, they proceeded to the restaurant along a walkway, which was covered in ice and snow. They spent about three hours at the bar, until about 12:30 or 1:00 a.m., when they decided to leave. After plaintiff had taken <a id="p1290" href="#p1290" data-label="1290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1290</a>two steps away from the door, he slipped and fell on a thick sheet of ice about one foot from the entrance.

In opposition to the motions, plaintiff argued that defendants owed a duty of care to remove snow and ice from the entranceway. The plaintiff also pointed to defendant Lei’s Bar &amp; Grill’s answers to interrogatories, in which defendant indicated that the general manager had shoveled the walk and had applied ice melt at around noon, when he arrived at the premises.

Absent unusual circumstances, the law allows a landlord or business owner a reasonable time to remove a natural accumulation of ice or snow from the premises because it is unreasonable that he be “required to be at his property, shovel in hand, catching the flakes before they hit the ground.” <em>Benaski, </em><a href="/a2d/899/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="899 A.2d 499" data-case-ids="8419543" data-case-paths="/a2d/899/0499-01">899 A.2d at 503</a> (quoting <em>Barenbaum v.

It is to be expected that a patron of a bar must use the entranceway to get access to the establishment and that an entranceway accumulates ice and snow in a snowstorm. The mere fact that the defendant’s manager undertook the task of shoveling and applying ice melt earlier in the day did not increase the risk created by a continuing storm. Furthermore, the act of inspecting the premises does not itself increase any risk to the plaintiff that did not already exist naturally as a result of the storm. As in <em>Benaski, </em>the plaintiff has failed to point to any conduct by the defendants that “exacerbated the risk that the plaintiff voluntarily undertook by commuting to and from [a restaurant and bar] during a severe winter storm.” <em>Benaski, </em><a href="/a2d/899/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="899 A.2d 499" data-case-ids="8419543" data-case-paths="/a2d/899/0499-01">899 A.2d at 504</a>.
