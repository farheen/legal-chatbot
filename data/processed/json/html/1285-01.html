Thus, [the Shons] argue, the absence of a license for the Center automatically eliminates it from constituting a health care provider or licensed professional. However, the language of the statute allows for <em>either </em>licensure or approval, giving no guidance to what constitutes approval. [The Shons’] contention that the legislature intended “approved” to have the same meaning as “licensed” is defeated by the mere existence of both words in the statutory language. Had the legislature intended only those entities that were licensed to be considered for health care providers, it would not have allowed for the alternative of “approval.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1324-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1324.9",1324,[1036,621,713,1947]]]'>[The Shons] correctly assert that the Center was not licensed by the Commonwealth to provide health care or professional medical services. That, [the Shons] contend, completes the analysis. However, as delineated above, li-censure is not required to achieve health care provider status. Rather, mere approval by the Commonwealth suffices. Here, the Articles of Incorporation for the Center, filed with the Secretary of State of Ohio in 1996, state that the purpose of the corporation is to engage in and carry on all branches of the practice of Podiatric medicine. The Center then registered to do business in and received a Certificate of Authority from the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Obviously, the purpose of the corporation — engaging in the practice of podiatric medicine — would clearly fall within health care or professional medical services for purposes of MCARE’s definition of health care provider. There is no authority that states approval requires some formal action or documentation by the Commonwealth. It appears evident that allowing this corporation, one who functions as a podiatry center, to conduct business in Pennsylvania suffices as “approval” as required by the statute. As such, the Center constitutes a licensed professional, and, pursuant to Rule 1042.1, a certificate of merit was required. Consequently, the absence of such a certificate of merit supports the Prothonotary’s entry of a judgment of Non Pros against [Shon],</blockquote>

Thus, it is Karason’s actions which are at issue, not any negligence of the Center itself. To hold that a certificate of merit is not required in a situation where the allegation is against the entity rather than the individual, but is still grounded in the individual’s alleged negligence, would create an easy manner for litigants to circumvent the certificate of merit requirement. Since the Center is a health care provid[er] for purposes of MCARE, a certificate of merit was required to maintain an action in professional negligence.</blockquote>
