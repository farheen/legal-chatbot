    <p id="b164-25" data-blocks='[["BL_164.24",164,[1023,1175,749,563]]]'>The Town of Hope appeals from the summary judgment entered in the Superior Court (Knox County, <em>Mead, J.) </em>in favor of Episcopal Camp Foundation, Inc., on its complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the property of the Foundation is exempt from taxation pursuant to 36 M.R.S.A. § 652(1) (1990 &amp; Supp.1994). Because we conclude that the court correctly determined that the Foundation is conducted exclusively for benevolent or charitable purposes, we affirm the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b164-26" data-blocks='[["BL_164.25",164,[1017,1764,750,992]],["BL_165.1",165,[204,238,745,86]]]'>The record reveals the following undisputed facts: The Foundation is a nonprofit corporation that operates Camp Bishops wood, a summer camp for second through tenth grade boys and girls on its property located on Lake Megunticook in the Town of Hope. The Foundation’s corporate purpose as set forth in its articles of incorporation is “to maintain camps for both men and women which will carry on moral, cultural, religious and recreational training and education, instruction in arts and crafts and nature lore, good citizenship, social living and civic responsibility, and to cooperate in community welfare enterprises.” The articles of incorporation further provide that all profits derived from the operation of the camp shall be devoted exclusively to the purposes for which it is organized and no officer of the corporation shall receive any pecuniary profit except reasonable compensation. Charges for oper<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>ating the camp shall be limited to expenses actually incurred.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[200,362,752,1039]]]'>The board of trustees is comprised of nine unpaid members of the Episcopal Diocese of Maine. The board hires an executive director as a full-time employee who hires staff for the camp. The staff attends a week-long pre-camp training session in which communication skills, counseling relationships, teaching by example, affirming and supporting the children, shared responsibility, and group living are emphasized. The four goals of the camp are (1) to affirm individuality, (2) to provide experiential community living, (3) to provide children with the opportunity to be involved with the natural environment, and (4) to allow the children to enjoy themselves. In addition to some religious teaching in a “Faith Development” class, the camp conducts most of the traditional summer camp activities such as swimming, games, arts and crafts, nature study, and sports. The weekly schedule is patterned after the Order for Celebrating the Holy Eucharist.</p>
    <p id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[199,1438,747,410]]]'>The Foundation allows Episcopalian children and past campers to register first. In 1992, 80% of the campers were in that group. The Foundation does not exclude non-Episcopalians and does not seek to indoctrinate campers in the Episcopalian faith. The Foundation seeks a diverse community and sponsors hearing-impaired children and several African-American children.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[195,1893,752,846]],["BL_165.7",165,[1000,237,747,79]]]'>If a camper requires financial assistance, the Foundation advises the parents to first contact their local Episcopal diocese, many of which provide scholarships for the camp regardless of whether the family is Episcopalian. If the family is unable to obtain financial assistance from the diocese, the Foundation provides a scholarship. The money for the scholarships is not derived from camp tuition but is provided by donations by the Episcopal church and parents. In most cases the Foundation scholarship equals one-half of the weekly tuition, but if more assistance is required, the Foundation provides a larger scholarship. The scholarships are provided on request and the Foundation does not independently verify the family’s financial need. In 1992, at least 22% of the children attending the camp received scholarships from the Foundation.</p>
    <p id="b165-8" data-blocks='[["BL_165.8",165,[997,343,750,561]]]'>In 1992 full tuition was $165 per week, which was sufficient to cover only two-thirds of the operating costs of the camp. The rest of the operating costs were derived from charitable donations and income generated by leasing the property in the off-season. By providing scholarships and keeping the tuition rate below cost, the Foundation attempts to keep the camp affordable to as many children as possible. Full tuition is approximately one-third of the tuition per week charged by the average for-profit camp.</p>
    <p id="b165-9" data-blocks='[["BL_165.9",165,[996,926,750,652]]]'>The Foundation has owned the property since 1962. In 1993, the Town asserted for the first time that the Foundation’s property was subject to real estate taxation. The Town assessed taxes of $13,909.50 for 1992 and $13,855.89 for 1993. On May 21, 1993, the Foundation brought the present action pursuant to the Maine Declaratory Judgments Act, 14 M.R.S.A. §§ 5951-5963 (1980 &amp; Supp.1994), seeking a declaration that the Foundation’s property is exempt from taxation pursuant to 36 M.R.S.A. § 652(1)(A) and seeking to enjoin the Town from assessing or collecting taxes.</p>
    <p id="b165-10" data-blocks='[["BL_165.10",165,[992,1601,751,792]]]'>The Foundation filed a motion for a summary judgment in which the following facts were undisputed by the parties: (1) the Foundation’s production of income is incidental to its dominant purpose, (2) the Foundation is not a pretense to avoid taxation, (3) the Foundation has no profit motive, revealed or concealed, (4) none of the Foundation’s officials receive any pecuniary profit other than reasonable compensation, and (5) all profits are devoted exclusively to the purposes for which it is organized. The only issue between the Town and the Foundation, therefore, was whether, based on the undisputed factual record, the Foundation is organized and conducted exclusively-for benevolent and charitable purposes.</p>

    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[213,484,758,1280]]]'>The activities offered at the Camp, including those directed to the goals of “good citizenship, social living and civic responsibility and to cooperate in community welfare enterprises,” do not materially differ from the activities typically offered by children’s summer camps that operate for profit. Nor can it be said that the activities are a public benefit akin to providing services to indigent or low-income persons or persons requiring health care. In my opinion, the purpose of the Foundation in establishing Camp Bish-opswood was to provide to any child, regardless of financial need, a summer camp experience. As laudable as this goal may be, it is not “unmistakably within the spirit and intent” of section 651. <em>Holbrook Island Sanctuary v.

On this record, the Foundation should not be exempt from the universal obligation to contribute proportionately toward the cost to the government in meeting public needs. There being no challenge to the amount of the assessed tax, I would vacate the judgment and remand this case for the entry of a judgment in favor of the Town of Hope.</p>
