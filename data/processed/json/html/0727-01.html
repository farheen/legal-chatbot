To give some meaning to the first part of Section 10(a), I would hold that the failure of the subcontractor to provide such a statement means that the general contractor receives final payment for the work, less any funds retained for work performed by one its subcontractors. In this <a id="p737" href="#p737" data-label="737" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*737</a>case, First Choice not only failed to provide a statement that all work was performed, but it conceded that it owed its employees wages totaling $25,797.19.
