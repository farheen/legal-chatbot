Kirkpatrick and Anne M. Kirkpatrick, to show cause why the issues raised in the plaintiffs appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff has appealed the denial of his motion for a new trial on one <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>count of fraud following the entry of judgment for the defendants on that count.</p>

    <p id="b586-17" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[190,637,756,944]]]'>The underlying transaction that gave rise to this case was the sale of shares in Academic Enterprises, Inc., which operated as the Sawyer School, to Regina Kelly in 1985. Michael Kelly, Regina’s husband, actually operated the proprietary school. At the jury trial in the Superior Court, three claims were addressed: (1) the plaintiff’s promissory note claim for $29,000 was granted against defendants; (2) the defendants’ counterclaim seeking a dividend payment from the business was denied; and (3) the plaintiff’s claim that he was defrauded by defendants was denied. Final judgments entered on the promissory note count and the dividend claim. The plaintiff moved for a new trial on the fraud claim only. The motion was denied, and plaintiff filed a timely appeal only from that portion of the judgment that denied a new trial on the fraud claim.</p>
    <p id="b586-18" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[187,1629,756,366]]]'>The plaintiff contends that the jury compromised the fraud count by “trading off” this count for the defendants’ counterclaim. The trial justice noted that both “sides presented the jury with an abundance of facts and figures, either of which looked at alone was supportive” of the respective parties’ claims.</p>
