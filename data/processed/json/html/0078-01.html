Ms. Brandt was employed with Bradford Manor as a licensed practical nurse from March 3, 1989, through October 31, 1989. Ms. Brandt’s employment was terminated after an investigation of verbal abuse and intimidation complaints were reported by other employees. A referee concluded that Ms. Brandt’s use of obscene language and abuse of employees was in violation of her employer’s policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The referee held that Ms. Brandt’s behavior amounted to willful misconduct and denied her benefits under section 402(e) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. § 802(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

First, Ms. Brandt contends that the referee did not find that she used obscenity. She submits that the referee found only that she was discharged after an investigation. Second, Ms. Brandt avers that the referee did not “find” that she abused or intimidated anyone. Finally, Ms. Brandt argues that the referee did not find that she violated the employer’s rule pertaining to abuse or intimidation. She alleges that the referee found only that some employees felt intimidated by her.</p>
    <p id="b145-13" data-blocks='[["BL_145.13",145,[936,740,756,464]]]'>Appellee, the Board, argues that the Commonwealth Court properly determined that Ms. Brandt’s admitted use of obscene and abusive language violated Bradford Manor’s rules and standards of behavior, which a nursing home can rightfully expect of its employees. Also, Appellee contends that Ms. Brandt’s behavior amounted to willful misconduct resulting in her ineligibility for benefits.</p>
    <p id="b145-14" data-blocks='[["BL_145.14",145,[935,1252,756,712]]]'>In this case, the use of obscene language at the workplace has been attributed to Ms. Brandt on two occasions. First, one of Ms. Brandt’s subordinates testified that when she failed to obtain a urine specimen from a patient, as Ms. Brandt had instructed, Ms. Brandt responded by saying, “Five minutes and this test was f — ed up.” Notes of Testimony — Referee’s Hearing dated March 1, 1990, at 8. In the second instance, another subordinate alleged that Ms. Brandt used obscene language when a patient waived his cane at members of her staff and Ms. Brandt asserted to one of her nurses, “I’ll take that damn cane away from him.” <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>
    <p id="b145-15" data-blocks='[["BL_145.15",145,[932,2005,755,279]]]'>Ms. Brandt submits that the former of the two scenarios did not take place and that her use of the word “damn” in the latter instance was neither obscene nor abusive in modern parlance. Ms. Brandt only admits to having used profanity at the workplace in the past.</p>

      <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>The referee had the opportunity to listen to and evaluate the testimony of both Ms. Brandt and witnesses on behalf of the employer and she clearly allocated greater weight to the testimony of the employer’s witnesses. The referee, based on this testimony, found that Ms. Brandt used abusive language and intimidation indicating an intentional disregard of the employer’s interests. Referee’s Decision, Appeal No. 90-7-A-13, dated March 1, 1990.</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[214,773,756,461]]]'>Ms. Brandt alleges that both the referee and the Commonwealth Court lacked sufficient evidence concerning the context in which her profanity was used to find willful misconduct and deny benefits. Ms. Brandt argues that <em>Bush v. Commonwealth, Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/48/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="48 Pa.

However, <em>Bush </em>is distinguishable.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[213,1273,755,795]]]'>In <em>Bush, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that where there is a lack of evidence concerning the context in which profanity was used, an employee’s admission that he used <em>profanity while on </em>the job is <em>not </em>itself sufficient to support a legal conclusion of willful misconduct rendering an employee ineligible for benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 293, <a href="/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="409 A.2d 523">409 A.2d at 524</a>. Because the testimony at the referee’s hearing failed to provide concrete evidence pertaining to the context in which the profanity was used, the Commonwealth Court was “unprepared to hold on the basis of [the] record that claimant’s admission that he used profanity on the job ‘[a]t times’ is itself sufficient to support a legal conclusion of willful misconduct. ...” <em><a href="/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="409 A.2d 523">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[212,2123,756,613]]]'>Instantly, however, there is concrete evidence of the context in which the profanity was used. First, the testimony presented during the hearing before the referee reveals that a witness stated she heard Ms. Brandt use profanity. Second, the testimony provides a clear picture of the context in which the profane language was used. Here, the context was that Ms. Brandt used profanity while talking to a member of her staff and, moreover, her use of profanity was unprovoked. Finally, the use of this profanity was against the employer’s policy.</p>
