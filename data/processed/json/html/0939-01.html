The trial court awarded summary judgment to Ms. Caldwell and voided the deed on the ground that the District of Columbia had failed to send by registered or certified mail a notice of the expiring redemption period to the record owner of the property, as the District was required to do by law. The court ruled that this failure could not be cured by a showing that Ms. Caldwell had actual knowledge of the Estate’s redemption rights. The court conditioned reversion of the property to the Estate on repayment to Associated Estates of amounts it had paid for taxes and conveyance of the deed.

Denise Caldwell was appointed to be the personal representative of his estate. At the time of his death, Eugene Caldwell owned real property located at 4312 3rd Street, N.W. in the District of Columbia. The following year, the District of Columbia asserted a hen against that property for unpaid 1995 taxes. The District acquired the lien itself at a sale held in July 1996, and later that year it packaged the lien with a large number of other delinquent tax liens and sold them in bulk to an entity known as the District TLC Trust 1996. <em>See </em>D.C.Code §§ 47-1303, 1303.04(a), (b) (2001). The sale was evidenced by a tax lien certificate, which is required to recite the name of the record owner and the full amount of the lien, including penalties, interest, and costs accrued as of the date of the sale for each property. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 47-1303.04(d). On August 13, 1997, the District TLC Trust sold the tax lien on the 4312 3rd Street property to Associated Estates for $1,119.51, the amount of the lien.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This notice was required to be furnished “by registered or certified mail ... at least 30 days in advance of expiration of the redemption period.” D.C.Code § 47-1303.04(0(1) (2001); <em>see also </em>9 DCMR. § 317.3 (1998). Accordingly, on September 9, 1997, in purported compliance with these statutory requirements, the District sent a notice addressed to Eugene Caldwell at 4312 3rd Street, N.W., advising him that his statutory right to redeem the property would expire in thirty-days. The District sent this notice, however, by what the parties have termed “regular” mail, not by registered or certified mail.

Associated Estates contends that it was improper for the trial court to grant summary judgment in this case, despite the District’s failure to send notice of the expiring redemption period by registered or certified mail, because there existed a genuine issue as to whether Ms. Caldwell had actual notice of her redemption rights. Specifically, Associated Estates sought the opportunity to prove that Ms. Caldwell had complete control of and access to the 4312 3rd Street property, and that she received the notice that the District sent to Eugene Caldwell at that address by “regular” mail. In addition, Associated Estates contends that even if the award of summary judgment was otherwise proper, the trial court erred in ruling that it had no right to reimbursement for the costs it incurred to maintain and improve the property.</p>

Strict compliance is required to “guard against the deprivation of property without due process of law,” and because “it is the policy of the state to give the delinquent taxpayer every reasonable opportunity, compatible with the rights of the state, to redeem his property.” <em>Potomac Bldg. Corp. v. Karkenny, </em><a href="/a2d/364/0809-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="364 A.2d 809" data-case-ids="8018444" data-case-paths="/a2d/364/0809-01">364 A.2d 809</a>, 812 (D.C.1976) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

Although the District did utilize registered mail to send the notice in <em>Boddie </em>(unlike in the present case), it misaddressed the envelope, in a way that created a substantial danger that the notice would not reach the intended recipient.

The District deviated from those requirements when it failed to send the notice of the expiration of the redemption period by certified or registered mail. That deviation was material for the same reason as in <em>Boddie </em>— -it created a substantial danger that the notice would not reach the intended recipient. “By mandating that the record owner be notified, by certified or [registered] mail, of the final date for redeeming the property, the Council indicated the particular importance it attached to this potentially final opportunity for people to save their property.” <em>Malone v.

The use of certified or registered mail instead of ordinary mail increases the probability that the post office delivers the notice to the proper party. In addition, the use of certified or registered mail results in an unambiguous record of whether the requisite notification has occurred or not. The creation of such a record helps to prevent expensive and time-consuming disputes over notice, such as the dispute in this very case. All parties’ rights are protected, and all parties are benefitted, by strict adherence to the prescribed procedures — not least the tax sale purchaser, who can know with certainty that the record owner has been notified properly, and can then proceed with confidence that the tax deed is valid.</p>

Justice would seem to require the protection of an unfortunate owner against too hasty or radical changes in the character of the property by an ambitious tax buyer, which might amount to appropriation even though the deed proved to be void and the purchaser was without title.</blockquote>
