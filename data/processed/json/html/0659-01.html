After approximately an hour of this tirade, Mr. Ball crossed the street toward Ms. Jackson carrying a beer bottle. Ms. Jackson, in turn, came down from the porch, walked into the street and confronted Mr. Ball with a small knife in her hand.

Kerry Jackson was carrying his long “shiny” knife, Sandra Jackson was carrying her small knife, and Joe Davis was carrying a handgun. In an attempt to escape, Mr. Ball weaved in and out of the parked cars, stumbling repeatedly. He was finally caught by his pursuers, now joined by Mr. Curtis Nero, after he fell in front of 1247 Wylie Street. There Mr. Nero held him from behind while Kerry Jackson stabbed him in the chest. When his attackers retreated, Mr. Ball, bleeding profusely, arose and stumbled into a nearby vacant lot. While Mr. Ball was lying unconscious, Kerry Jackson walked over to Mr. Ball and kicked him several times in the head in an apparent attempt to determine if he was alive or dead.

      <em>See Comber v. United States, supra, </em>note 6, 584 A.2d at 38.

Proving the intent sufficient for a conviction of assault to kill while armed requires the government to establish evidence of specific “intent to kill.” D.C.Code § 22-501 (1989); <em>see Logan v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/483/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="483 A.2d 664" data-case-ids="7932994" data-case-paths="/a2d/483/0664-01">483 A.2d 664</a>, 672 (D.C.1984). In proving malice, the government need not elect prior to trial one type of malicious conduct over the others.

The “inherent relationship” test for identifying lesser-included offenses focuses on the evidence adduced at trial in addition to the abstract elements of the offenses in determining whether one offense is a lesser-included offense of another. Under this scheme, one offense is to be included in another where the two offenses (1) relate to the protection of the same interests; and (2) are so related that in the general nature of these crimes, though not necessarily invariably, proof of the lesser offense is necessarily presented as part of the showing of the commission of the greater offense. <em>See Government of the Virgin Islands v.
