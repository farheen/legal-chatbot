Appellant, Mattye F., now raises the following issues for our review:</p>

    <p id="b793-11" data-blocks='[["BL_793.11",793,[200,1807,749,84]]]'>Appellant’s Brief at 2. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>
    <p id="b793-12" data-blocks='[["BL_793.12",793,[199,1914,755,656]]]'>Juanita, born June 2, 1988, is the child of appellee, Tracey L., and Eddie S. Although the parents never married and no longer have a romantic relationship with one another, both have maintained a relationship with Juanita. In January of 1990, appellee enrolled in college as a full-time nursing student while appellant, who had raised appellee from infancy although they are not biologically related, cared for Juanita. In August of 1990, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, appellant was awarded primary physical custody of Juanita, while appellee retained custody alternate weekends.</p>
    <p id="b793-13" data-blocks='[["BL_793.13",793,[200,2596,752,132]],["BL_793.14",793,[1001,226,751,659]]]'>On October 4, 1993, appellee filed a petition to modify, seeking primary custody of Juanita. Following a hearing on December 7, 1993, the trial judge denied appellee s request for primary custody, but suggested the parties work out a schedule providing appel-lee with increased visitation. As a result, the parties agreed that appellee would have custody of Juanita every Thursday after school until Monday morning. On March 18, 1994, appellee filed a second petition seeking primary physical custody of Juanita. After a second hearing on September 26, 1994, the trial judge transferred custody of Juanita from appellant to appellee and denied appellant’s request for visitation. This timely appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b793-15" data-blocks='[["BL_793.15",793,[997,938,752,800]]]'>In the instant case, appellant, who has no familial relationship to the child, is a third party. Typically, a third party lacks standing to seek custody against the natural parents. <em>Cardamone v. Elshoff, </em><a href="/pa-super/442/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="442 Pa.

Here, however, appellant, who not only acted in loco parentis, but also was previously awarded primary custody, clearly has standing to challenge the September 26, 1994 custody order. <em>See Cardamone, </em><a href="/pa-super/442/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="442 Pa. Super. 263" data-case-ids="719779" data-case-paths="/pa-super/442/0263-01">442 Pa.Super. at 274-75</a>, <a href="/pa-super/442/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="659 A.2d 575" data-case-ids="719779,7873473" data-case-paths="/pa-super/442/0263-01,/a2d/659/0575-01">659 A.2d at 581</a> (in loco parentis status is an exception to the “third-party-lack-of-standing-preclusion”). Although appellant has standing, she faces a heavy burden challenging Juanita’s natural mother’s right to custody.</p>
    <blockquote id="b793-16" data-blocks='[["BL_793.16",793,[1033,1765,717,751]]]'>The question still is, What is in the child’s best interest? However, the parties do not start out even; the parents have a “prima facie right to custody,” which will be forfeited only if “convincing reasons” appear that the child’s best interest will be served by an award to the third party. Thus, even before the proceedings start, the evi-dentiary scale is tipped, and tipped hard, to the parents’ side. What the judge must do, therefore, is first hear all evidence relevant to the child’s best interest, and then decide whether the evidence on behalf of the third party is weighty enough to bring the scale up to even, and down on the third party’s side.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b794-4" data-blocks='[["BL_794.4",794,[270,360,719,882]]]'>The scope of review of an appellate court reviewing a child custody order is of the broadest type; the appellate court is not bound by the deductions or inferences made by the trial court from its findings of fact, nor must the reviewing court accept a finding that has no competent evidence to support it. However, this broad scope of review does not vest in the reviewing court the duty or the privilege of making its own independent determination. Thus, the appellate court is empowered to determine whether the trial court’s incontrovertible factual findings support its factual conclusions, but may not interfere vrith those conclusions unless they are unreasonable in view of the trial court’s factual findings; and thus, represent a gross abuse of discretion.</blockquote>
