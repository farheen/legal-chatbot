On April 27, 1999, Pamela Montanya and her husband, Michael Montanya, filed a complaint against Mr. McGonegal averring that he was negligent in the operation of his motor vehicle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The sheriff served the complaint upon Agnes McGonegal, Mr. McGonegal’s widow.</p>

In the preliminary objections, it was alleged that the administrator/administratrix of Mr. McGonegal’s estate was not named as a party defendant, that the two-year statute of limitations had elapsed with regard to the Montanyas’ claim, and that the complaint was filed more than one year after Mr. McGonegal’s death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As a result, it was requested that the Montanyas’ complaint be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, improper service, and because a suit against a deceased person is a legal nullity. On July 19, 1999, the Montanyas filed an answer to the preliminary objections, alleging that they were unaware that Mr. McGonegal was deceased and that they had been misled with regard thereto. The Montanyas requested that the preliminary injunctions be denied and that they be permitted to file a new complaint.</p>

On December 14, 1999, the trial court granted the second preliminary objections and dismissed the Montanyas’ complaint with prejudice.

Specifically, the Montanyas contend that they were lulled into a false sense of security because (1) Agnes McGonegal accepted service from the sheriff of the complaint at issue without indicating that her husband was dead, (2) pre-suit correspondence with Mr. McGonegal’s insurance carrier indicated that Mr. McGonegal was alive, and (3) the insurance carrier concealed Mr. McGone-gal’s death after the complaint was filed and Agnes McGonegal told them about her husband’s death.</p>

The Montanyas argue, however, that Agnes had an affirmative duty to “pick up the phone” and contact the Montanyas’ attorney when she received the complaint to inform the attorney that her husband was deceased, and that her silence in this regard constitutes concealment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

It was the Montanyas’ obligation to determine whether Mr. McGonegal was deceased.
