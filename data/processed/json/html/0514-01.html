This appeal presents two issues: (1) did the arresting officer have probable cause to arrest appellant when her information was received from a police lieutenant who had received his information from a “realiable source” who was not identified to the arresting officer; and (2) did the trial court improperly base its denial of appellant’s motion to suppress as hearsay evidence the arresting officer’s testimony based upon a police department report of the incident completed by her partner.</p>

Third District Vice Unit instructed the arresting officer (Officer Scott) and her partner to meet him near a specific northwest address. Lt. Sefton told both officers that he had received information from a “reliable source”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that two men were sitting in front of the house at that address; one man named James, later identified as appellant, was reported by the source as “actually engaged in selling narcotics in that area, and that he had in his pants pocket some narcotics.” The lieutenant further reported that his source said the other man (named Jimmy) had a revolver in his right, front pants pocket; this individual was reported to be appellant’s bodyguard. Full, detailed descriptions of the two men were relayed by the lieutenant to the arresting officer and her partner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

As she walked toward the men, Officer Scott noticed a “large bulge” in the bodyguard’s right, pants pocket.

McCormick states that classifying “past memory recorded” as a hearsay exception is logical given the limited and peculiar “unavailability” required for its use, that is, some lack of memory by the witness. On the other hand, the reliability of the past record rests on the veracity of the witness now testifying and who was present and witnessed the occurrence which her partner recorded. Thus it has also been argued that the past record is not properly a hearsay/hearsay exception problem. McCormick on Evidence § 299, at 713 (2d ed. 1972). In <em>Cohen v. Berry, </em>D.C. App., <a href="/a2d/188/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="188 A.2d 302" data-case-ids="8111774" data-case-paths="/a2d/188/0302-01">188 A.2d 302</a>, 304 (1963), the court held that the "past memory recorded” report “is received as a substitute for present memory and is offered for the truth of its contents.” Thus it would seem the reports in the District fall under the hearsay exception theory. The Federal Rules of Evidence also classify past memory recorded as a hearsay exception (Kule 803(5)) :</p>

Appellant attempts to bolster his argument of improper admission of the report by showing that ,the judge did not admit the report into evidence. According to McCormick, admission of the report itself is more appropriately a concern at the jury stage of the .trial, the danger being that the jury will give the report undue weight. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 713 n. 8. The Federal Rules of Evidence mandate what the judge in the instant case in fact did; the report may be read into evidence but not received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.

It is undisputed that when an informant’s tip is a necessary element in a finding that probable cause existed to arrest a suspect, the tip’s proper weight is determined by measuring it against the standards articulated in <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em><a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">378 U.S. 108</a>, <a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">84 S.Ct. 1509</a>, <a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">12 L.Ed.2d 723</a> (1964). If the tip .is to be credited, the judge at the pretrial suppression hearing must be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that appellant was selling narcotics, and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the police officer concluded that the informant was credible or his information reliable. <em>Aguilar v. Texas, <a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">supra </a></em><a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">at 114</a>, <a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">84 S.Ct. 1509</a>. This is the “two-pronged test” of <em>Aguilar. Spinelli v. United States, </em><a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">393 U.S. 410</a>, 413, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">89 S.Ct. 584</a>, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">21 L.Ed.2d 637</a> (1969). It is agreed we must apply this test to the facts of this case. It is also agreed the informant’s tip here initially failed to satisfy either prong of <em>Aguilar's </em>test. I feel that there may be some ambiguity in the majority opinion, however, as to the manner in which the deficiency in each prong was remedied. In an attempt to advance clarity in an area of the law which I feel has suffered from imprecision in expression and analysis, I would like to set forth briefly the approach which I believe follows from the principles of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli.</em>

However, this deficiency may be remedied if the tip itself describes “the accused’s criminal activity in sufficient detail that the . . [court] may know that he [the informant] is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual’s, general reputation.” <em>Spinelli v.

Here, Officer Scott testified that prior to appellant’s arrest she observed the two men positioned in front of the specific house as the informant had said. But even more important, however, was the officer’s discovery of a gun on the person of appellant’s companion, described as appellant’s “bodyguard,” precisely where the informant’s report said it was. Thus, before arresting appellant, the tip had been corroborated to an extent that it was reasonable to conclude that the informant was telling the truth in alleging that appellant was committing a crime. The initial deficiency with respect to the veracity prong was remedied thereby.</p>

As the majority points out, this case presents a problem which has confronted us before, namely, whether the government can establish probable cause at a suppression hearing without the testimony of the police officer who has firsthand knowledge of the tip relied on in making the arrest. <em>See Galloway v.

More specifically, the government attempted to prove probable cause through testimony by Officer Scott as to what Lieutenant Sefton had told her the informant had said to <em>him. </em>This amounted to “double” hearsay. As indicated above, I conclude that the out-of-court declaration of the informant passes the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test and could be credited by the judge at the suppression hearing. And although appellant does not specifically argue this point, I am inclined to believe that the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>approach should similarly govern the question whether the out-of-court declaration of Lieutenant Sefton can be credited. Given the facts (a) that he personally conversed with the informant and (b) that he is a police officer, I would hold that his statement to Officer Scott as to what the informant said also would satisfy both prongs of <em>Aguilar.
