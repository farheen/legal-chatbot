The first judge presided over a preliminary hearing. A police officer then gave hearsay testimony directed to the question of probable cause. The court denied defense counsel’s request to compel testimony by the complaining witness. At a later status hearing before a second trial judge, a different defense counsel asked that another preliminary hearing be held, again seeking to have the complaining witness compelled to testify. The court concluded that the earlier ruling as to the possible pretrial testimony of that witness was in effect the law of the case, and denied the request. Between that date and the trial date, the complaining witness became a murder victim. When the matter came on for trial before the third judge, a motion was made to dismiss the relevant counts of the indictment. That motion was based solely on the absence of the complaining witness’ testimony at the preliminary hearing. The third judge concluded that both of the two prior judges had erred, and granted the motion to dismiss. We reverse.</p>

As I came to work on March 30, 1972, Wayman Davis threw bricks at me, swung a butcher knife at me which stuck in the door of the restaurant where I work. He told me he had “killed one bitch and didn’t mind killing another.” I ran in the restaurant and called the police, but Wayman Davis had run away when they arrived. I have since learned that Wayman Davis was convicted for killing a woman in 1963, and I am afraid for my life. Other than being a witness in the previous arrest in January, 1972, Mr. Davis is a stranger to me.</blockquote>

Later, charges of assault with a dangerous weapon (brick), carrying a dangerous weapon (knife), and obstruction of justice were added. A preliminary hearing was held on April 6, 1972. The arresting officer testified. He went considerably beyond the succinct assertions in the affidavit; it was obvious that he had discussed the case at some length with Miss Cummings. He testified that appellee had verbally abused and threatened Miss Cummings on numerous occasions, and had said that he would kill her if she testified against him. The officer stated that appellee had stabbed at Miss Cummings with the knife on March 30, but missed her as she was pulled to safety by a third person. All of the officer’s testimony was hearsay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Subsequent to the ruling here under review, the Superior Court criminal rule covering preliminary hearings [Rule 5(c)] was amended by the addition of the following language: “The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.” Such an addition represented merely a codification of existing common law.</p>

The basic and limited function of a preliminary hearing is to permit judicial consideration of whether there is probable cause to hold an accused for trial. <em>See </em>Barber v.

The record is replete with Davis’ expressions of dissatisfaction with his appointed attorneys, irrespective of their abilities and efforts on his behalf. He had two successive attorneys at the trial level, and two before this court. Davis moved pro se to vacate the appointment of his second appellate attorney.
