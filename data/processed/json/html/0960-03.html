As the car in question drove by, Officer Longmire noticed substantial damage to the car’s front end and that the headlights were indeed askew. Based on his observations, the officer executed a traffic stop, surveyed the ear, and subjected the driver, Appellant, to a sobriety test. When Appellant failed the sobriety test, the officer arrested Appellant and charged him with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The court denied Appellant’s suppression motion and, based on the notes of testimony of the preliminary hearing combined with the laboratory report indicating that Appellant possessed a 0.27% blood alcohol level, convicted Appellant for DUI. Appellant was sentenced to serve not less than thirty days or more than twenty-three months in the Bucks County Prison, the minimum sentence to be served on house arrest.

Hudak, </em><a href="/a2d/710/1213-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="710 A.2d 1213" data-case-ids="11845658" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/1213-01">710 A.2d 1213</a>, 1215 (Pa.Super.1998). Looking only at the Commonwealth’s evidence as presented by Officer Longmire, since it was the sole evidence presented at the suppression hearing, I do not believe the record of his testimony viewed as a whole supports a conclusion that he had reasonable grounds to suspect that Appellant’s lights were misaligned in violation of the Motor Vehicle Code. The officer’s estimate of a deviation of six inches was an extremely crude estimate made while both vehicles were in motion and with no fixed point of reference by which to estimate the deviation of the headlight’s aim from center. The officer in fact expressly acknowledged that he had no way of measuring the deviation.

The officer merely testified that he estimated Appellant’s headlight to be six inches above the driver’s side headlight. It is therefore quite possible that the aim of both headlights were within the permissible range of deviation from center. For example the aim of <a id="p965" href="#p965" data-label="965" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*965</a>the driver’s side headlight may have been two inches below center vertically while the aim of the passenger’s side headlight could have been four inches above center vertically.

    <p id="b1003-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1003.4",1003,[161,763,755,832]]]'>¶ 7 The regulation also requires that measurements of a headlight’s permissible deviation from center are to be made with a mechanical aimer. The regulations do not allow for the measurements to be made with the naked and unaided eye, even by a trained mechanic at a short distance. Certainly if a mechanical degree of precision is required to gauge the deviation from center of a headlights aim, then an observation made with the naked eye cannot be considered to be a reasonably accurate estimate of the precise deviation of a headlight’s aim from center, particularly whenever made from a distance of 100 yards initially and with both vehicles in motion.</p>

However, the officer testified that the Appellant’s headlights were properly illuminating the area in front of the vehicle. The officer did not testify that the lights were shining into his eyes or illuminating areas completely off the road. The officer in fact acknowledged not observing their angle of aim at all. The officer therefore had no reasonable objective basis to believe that they were misaligned in violation of the Vehicle Code other than his observation that they were “askew” from one another by six inches. A reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity requires the officer to rely on specific and articulable facts which together from the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the stop of a vehicle. <em>Commonwealth v.

N.T., Suppression Hearing at 12. When the officer was asked at the suppression hearing what section of the vehicle code he believed Appellant to be violating when he pulled him over, the officer testified: “I believe it’s the 4300 section of the vehicle code. I could look it up for you now.” <em>Id. </em>at 12. However, he gave no specific testimony as to what exact section of the motor vehicle code that he believed Appellant to be violating. While Chapter 43 of the Vehicle Code governs lighting equipment for vehicles generally there are eight separate statutory subsections within this chapter none of which govern or regulate the inspection of vehicles. Also the first statutory section within the chapter begins with Section 4301.</p>
