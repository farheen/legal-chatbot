The wording of subsection (a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which forbids the mere possession of certain specifically named items, is clearly distinguishable from subsection (b) by its total lack of any requirement that the possessor of these items intends to use them unlawfully.

In making this claim, however, appellee concedes that § 22-502 (assault with a dangerous weapon) is immune from such attack but contends that the effect of the language is distinguishable in the two provisions, since the necessity of proving an assault under § 22-502 insures a showing that the article was used unlawfully. But in light of our conclusion that intent to use unlawfully is a required element in both offenses, we find lacking in constitutional significance the fact that this intent must be demonstrated in § 22-502 by proving an assault while it may be proved in § 22-3214(b) by other means.</p>

It is difficult to understand the basis of appellee’s claim that, once the government alleges possession of an article under § 22-3214(b), the burden somehow shifts to the accused to establish the innocence of this possession. It is axiomatic that the burden rests on the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of an offense, and there is no reason to assume that § 22-3214 (b) admits of any exception to this basic, principle.</p>
