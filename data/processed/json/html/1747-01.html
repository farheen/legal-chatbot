Apparently, guessing from what the record shows, appellants inserted a group of copied or substantially copied claims numbered 16-33. The examiner’s final rejection rejects claims “16— 23” as “lacking basis in the disclosure.” It also refers specifically, in the discussion, to claims 17, 18, 19, 25, and 27 and then to claims 23-33. It would appear that the examiner intended to reject claims 16-33 as in his answer, following appeal to the board, he said the appeal involved the right to make claims “16-33.” The board, in its opinion, made it clear beyond question that it was dealing with and affirming a rejection of claims 16-33 on the ground of lack of support.</p>

The board rendered a second decision but, before it did so, an appeal on claims 16-21 and 24 <a id="p1750" href="#p1750" data-label="1750" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1750</a>and raising only the sufficiency of disclosure issue had been taken to this court on December 30, 1963. After the second decision of the board on other claims a second appeal was taken to this court on February 26, 1964. The latter appeal was stated in the notice of appeal to be an appeal on claims 2, 3, 6-11, 13-15, 32, and 33. At that time claims 32 and 33, as part of the claim group 16-33, were under rejection on all of the grounds (1), (2), and (3) above enumerated. The first appeal to this court makes no mention whatever of claims 32 and 33. The second appeal, while taken on these claims, along with eleven others, is very specific in pointing out the alleged errors of the board and includes, in the seven reasons of appeal (numbered 11 through 16 in supplementation of reasons 1 through 9 of the first appeal), only matters relating to the prior art rejection, (2) above, and the double patenting rejection, (1) above. There is no reason of appeal which, by the most liberal construction, indicates in any way, even generally, that the board erred in affirming the rejection of claims 32 and 33 for lack of support in appellants’ specification, (3) above. It is therefore clear that appellants have not brought that ground of rejection before us by <em>any </em>reason of appeal. In addition, appellants have not argued <em>this </em>rejection in their brief insofar as claims 32 and 33 are concerned. That this is so is very clear from the facts that in reciting the “questions presented” those two claims are not included among those rejected for lacle of support and in the “summary” they are not included among the claims as to which we are asked to reverse the lack of support rejection. Appellants argue the other two rejections of claims 32 and 33 but appear to have overlooked the fact they were rejected on the ground of lack of support.</p>

The stretch-oriented articles of the invention are said to have high shrink energy at temperatures above 145° C. with a percent shrink of from 20 to 60% but to have a low shrink percentage at 100° C. An illustrative use given in the parent patent is a bag made from tubing, placed around a turkey and shrunk around it by heating to form a packaged product. A general outline of the process as described in the parent patent is that <em>polyethylene </em>is heated and extruded into tubular form following which these four steps take place: (1) cooling to a low enough temperature to permit handling, which may be about room temperature, (2) <em>irradiating </em>at a dosage of at least 2xl06 HEP, (3) reheating the irradiated material enough so it will stretch without breaking and bilaterally stretching it by inflating it into a bubble, and (4) cooling in the stretched condition to a form-retaining temperature. Such material, when sufficiently reheated, shrinks as above indicated. The parent case, after describing the processing of polyethylene, says, “there can also be used in the process of the invention solid polypropylene” and certain other named polymeric materials not important here. The parent specification also states that the process can be applied to polyethylene with omission of the irradiation step and gives a specific example of such a process. There follows the statement that “With polypropylene it has surprisingly been found that high shrink energy can be imparted without the use of irradiation and with only racking [the inflating step after reheating the extruded article] although both hot blowing [upon extrusion] and racking can be employed if desired.” There is then given “Example C” which is identical with “Example 1” of the application at bar and describes the processing of polypropylene by extruding a tube with simultaneous longitudinal stretch, cooling, reheating in a hot bath from which the tubing emerges in the form of an enlarged bubble <a id="p1752" href="#p1752" data-label="1752" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1752</a>which produces bilateral stretching by reason of inflation, and cooling the stretched product.</p>

In any event, he divided the claims between the two copending applications on the basis of including or excluding the irradiation step and prosecuted them simultaneously.</p>

Under said rule, appellants appear to have elected reconsideration by the examiner and then amended their claims to define the method as “consisting of” rather than “comprising” in order to meet one of the board’s arguments. Their purpose was to so word the claims as to exclude from the claimed method even the possibility of using irradiation. The examiner rejected the thus amended claims on the ground of double patenting and they came back to the board on a second appeal.

This problem may also be stated to be whether it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill to modify the process of the patent claims by eliminating the irradiation step. In considering this question it must be carefully remembered that by reason of the copend-ency of the application at bar and the application for the patent, the patent disclosure is not “prior art” and cannot be looked to for what it teaches.

They thus came into possession not only of the knowledge on which the patent claims are based but of the knowledge on which the appealed claims are based. On this basis they became aware of the fact, no known to the art so far as the record shows, that irradiation is not essential to the method when applied to polypropylene, that analogous results are obtained with that material whether or not it is irradiated, and of the specific examples which are used to illustrate the method of the claims on appeal, which do not include irradiation. It is only on the basis of these facts that the conclusion was reached that omitting irradiation does not make a “patentable” difference. But it is not permissible to rest the legal conclusion on this issue on knowledge thus gained from what is not “prior art.” The situation is indeed analogous to that in <em>In </em>re <em>Ruff, </em><a href="/ccpa/45-2/1037-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="45 C.C.P.A. 1037" data-case-ids="6080727" data-case-paths="/ccpa/45-2/1037-01">45 CCPA 1037</a>, <a href="/f2d/256/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="256 F.2d 590" data-case-ids="457135,6080727" data-case-paths="/f2d/256/0590-01,/ccpa/45-2/1037-01">256 F 2d 590</a>, <a href="/ccpa/45-2/1037-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="45 C.C.P.A. 1037" data-case-ids="6080727" data-case-paths="/ccpa/45-2/1037-01">118 USPQ 340</a>, as alleged by appellants, in which case we held that equivalence <em>taught by an applicant </em>but not known to the art could not be used to reject his claims on the ground of equivalency with prior art.

We see no value in it as a precedent. The reference there was a patent previously issued to the applicant Smith on a tobacco barn heater very like what he was claiming, but his patent issued in 1936 and his appealed application was filed six years afterward in 1942. Patentability depended on the obviousness of omitting a screen from his patented structure and the patent specification, which had long been “prior art” in the public domain at the time he filed, expressly taught that use of the screen was optional.

We will concede they show hollow filaments or threads for the textile art, but appellants disclose no such hollow filaments. They admit their application discloses tubing and the fact is that it is tubing of substantial diameter, from half an inch minimum when extruded to several feet when inflated for stretching. To practice their bilateral stretch process they must have a tube which they can inflate. No showing has been made of inflation of a filament or that it can be inflated. The argument is that though Munt concededly shows only solid filament, or ribbon, a filament can be hollow and thus be a tube and therefore appellants’ disclosure of tubes is a dis<a id="p1758" href="#p1758" data-label="1758" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1758</a>closure of filament.

It is drawn down into the bath by driven rolls at a speed of withdrawal “usually 100 to 600% greater than the speed of the polymer at the [extrusion] die face * * *.” In our opinion, appellants and Munt teach in opposite directions as to this initial phase of the process and appellants lack reasonable support for the “immediate” quenching step of the copied claims.</p>
