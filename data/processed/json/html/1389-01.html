Appellant cross-moved for a directed verdict and both sides submitted briefs in support of their respective motions. This appeal follows the trial court’s grant of GEICO’s motion for a directed verdict on the ground that appellants failed to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case because they did not introduce into evidence the insurance policy which was the subject of the garnishment action.</p>

The evidence in <em>Franklin Investment </em>was held insufficient because the plaintiff’s sole proof was a certificate of insurance which stated that its effectiveness depended on terms and conditions contained in another instrument. The court in <em>Franklin Investment </em>rejected the argument that ambiguities inherent in the plaintiff’s evidence should have been interpreted against the defendant insurance company, the party which moved for judgment at the close of the plaintiff’s case. The court concluded that it was the plaintiff’s failure to produce the insurance contract which had created the ambiguity about the contract’s application to the loss and held:</p>

On facts similar to this case, the court held that the plaintiff demonstrated the insurer’s liability on an insurance contract based solely on the insurer’s admissions in interrogatories without presenting the actual contract. In the instant case, appellants proved that part of the contract which was essential to their cause of action and therefore satisfied the minimum requirement for a <em>prima facie </em>case. The sworn admissions of GEICO presented by appellant at trial demonstrated (1) that GEICO issued an automobile liability insurance policy to Mrs. Holland; (2) that the policy was in effect at the time of the automobile collision; (3) that GEICO assigned a claim number to the incident and <a id="p1391" href="#p1391" data-label="1391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1391</a>undertook the defense of the insured in the Superior Court; and (4) that the judgment entered against the insured was within the liability limits of the insurance policy’s coverage. Appellant also proved the judgment against the insured.</p>

    <p id="b1445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1445.5",1445,[163,1397,749,736]]]'>The trial court in this case ruled that “[w]here the terms of an insurance contract are at issue, the contract must in some way be put before the trier of fact by the party seeking to benefit from the contract.” Specific terms of the insurance contract were never at issue. There is no indication in the record that the insurance contract issued by GEICO was anything other than a standard automobile liability insurance contract under which GEICO agreed to pay the insured’s damages and liabilities in connection with automobile usage. We view it to be the insurer’s burden to set forth any particular terms of an insurance contract which would diminish or void its liability.</p>

However, once the plaintiff proves a <em>prima facie </em>case, or the defendant admits all the facts necessary to establish the case, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove affirmative defenses such as forfeiture of the policy or breach of some contract provisions by the plaintiff. <em>Oklahoma Farm Bureau, supra at </em>118, <a href="/okla/207/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="207 Okla. 116" data-case-ids="8893914" data-case-paths="/okla/207/0116-01">247 P.2d at 971</a>; <em>Blue Bonnet, supra </em>at 375.</p>

Therefore, the failure to introduce the insurance contract was not a sufficient basis to deny recovery.</p>
