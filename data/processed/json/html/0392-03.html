Mr. Collura’s employer, A.A. Martini Construction Company, was hired to complete a construction project at-a New Kensington hospital. Mr. Collura’s.work consisted of pouring concrete on the roof of an addition to a medical building. The concrete was supplied by a hose that was powered by a pumper truck. While performing his work, the hose suddenly “bucked,” causing Mr. Collura to fall off the roof of the building, onto the ground, where he landed on his head, neck and back.

Prior to filing this civil action, the appellees filed a worker’s compensation claim against their employer, U.S. Steel, seeking compensation for the same alleged injuries. Subsequent to the filing of the civil complaint, the worker’s compensation referee found that appellees were not entitled to benefits under the Worker’s Compensation Act. After a civil trial ensued, several defendants moved for a compulsory non-suit and later a directed verdict claiming that the present civil action was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel due to the preclu-sive effect of the worker’s compensation determination against the plaintiffs. The trial court denied both motions and entered a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.

The <em>Phillips </em>court also noted that the worker’s compensation finding was final because the plaintiffs did not appeal the referee’s decision. Neither of these situations exist in the present ease. The Colluras may have a positive decision in the termination proceeding. Even assuming, arguendo, that Mr. Collura is ordered to resume work, this decision will not be final until Mr. Collura appeals such a finding. More importantly, however, this termination decision is not “identical” to the trial court’s determination in the present civil action— namely, whether L &amp; E is potentially liable in tort for Mr. Collura’s injuries. At most, the worker’s compensation decision may affect the amount of a potential damage award in the civil proceeding. Accordingly, we do not find this meritless claim of collateral estoppel to be a “compelling reason” under <em>Penn Piping, supra.</em>

In the present case the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the underlying personal injury action on January 19, 1989. On August 14, 1992, the plaintiffs’ attorney filed a praecipe for substitution of counsel. On May 19, 1993, the Colluras filed a brief in opposition to L &amp; E’s motion for summary judgment. On July 19, <em>1993, </em>the plaintiffs filed supplemental answers to defendant’s interrogatories. The last docket entry before the filing of Appellees' rule to show cause took place on June 28, 1994. This June of 1994 entry involved a praecipe for substitution of plaintiffs’ counsel. Finally, after receiving the Appellee’s rule to show cause, the Colluras placed the case at issue on August 3, 1995.</p>
