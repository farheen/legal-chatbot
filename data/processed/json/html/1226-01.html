The complaint also contained a reference to Article 1713.02(Z )(5) of the Erie Budding Code (Code) which indicated that Will’s license could be suspended, revoked or not renewed by the Board if Will had committed an act of <em>gross </em>negligence.

Section 1713.01, which the majority claims indirectly defines “gross negligence,” does nothing more than define the term “electrical contractor.” Neither that section nor any other section establishes an applicable standard of care against which an individual’s actions may be judged. The Board may not arbitrarily create standards which do not exist in order to justify a license suspension.

      <a id="p1229" href="#p1229" data-label="1229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1229</a>Because the Code does not define “the standard rules and regulations governing such work” or “gross negligence,” there is no standard against which Will’s work, as an electrical contractor, can be tested. Accordingly, charging Will' with “gross negligence” does not enable him to prepare a proper defense.</p>

Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the trial court.</p>
