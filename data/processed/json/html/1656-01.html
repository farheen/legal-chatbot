    <p id="b980-20" data-blocks='[["BL_980.23",980,[300,1996,1330,195]]]'>On March 16, 1959, appellant filed application serial No. 799,483, entitled “Gasoline Composition.” This appeal is from a decision of the board sustaining the examiner’s rejection of all the remaining claims, 2-13. Claim 2 is typical and reads:</p>
    <blockquote id="b980-21" data-blocks='[["BL_980.24",980,[304,2216,1325,203]],["BL_981.1",981,[182,287,1321,73]]]'>2. A gasoline composition consisting essentially of a branched chain di-lower-alkyl ether having from 4 through 8 carbon atoms in a mixture of naphthene, aromatic and paraffin gasoline boiling range hydrocarbons in which mixture the concentration of naphthenes is from about 2% to about 25% by volume, the concentration of aromatics is at least 15% and no more than 75% by volume and <a id="p1657" href="#p1657" data-label="1657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1657</a>which mixture contains no more than about 10% by volume of olefins, the concentration of ether in the composition being no more than about 50% by volume.</blockquote>
    <p id="b981-4" data-blocks='[["BL_981.4",981,[183,384,1322,247]]]'>It will be seen that what appellant is claiming is a gasoline composition. The position of the Patent Office here suggests the necessity for some basic thinking about the character of compositions of matter. From the standpoint of the patent law, a composition of matter is, as stated in <em>Robinson on Patents, </em>§ 193:</p>
    <blockquote id="b981-5" data-blocks='[["BL_981.5",981,[182,657,1324,279]]]'>
      <em>* * * </em>always a true combination. Each of its ingredients is itself a means whose operative forces mainifest themselves through the chemical or mechanical properties by which it is distinguished. * * * It differs from all other combinations in that its ingredients, or elemental means, when once united in the combination, often become individually undiscernible by human sense, and can be recovered and distinguished only by the destruction of the combination as a whole. * * *</blockquote>
    <p id="b981-6" data-blocks='[["BL_981.6",981,[183,965,1324,448]]]'>Thus, at least in the patent law context, a gasoline <em>composition </em>as here claimed is necessarily a complete and separate entity whose existence as such entity is distinct from the substances of which it is composed. Even though these substances may be old, the <em>composition </em>may be new. The character of a new <em>composition </em>of individually old substances cannot, therefore, be determined from an examination of its component elements alone. It must be judged rather by the intrinsic attributes of the composition as a new <em>combination. </em>See <em>Robinson, </em>supra, § 194.</p>
    <p id="b981-7" data-blocks='[["BL_981.7",981,[182,1419,1324,348]]]'>The gasoline composition as here claimed is but an embodiment of appellant’s invention which resulted from an appreciation of an existing problem in the compounding of gasoline compositions and the knowledgeable selection of j)articular substances or ingredients named in the claims which, when blended within the limits clearly set forth in the claims, provided the new combination for which appellant seeks a patent.</p>
    <p id="b981-8" data-blocks='[["BL_981.8",981,[183,1771,1323,549]]]'>These general observations take on particular significance in the context of the art to which the present invention relates. Gasoline compositions are readily evaluated for their so-called anti-knock properties by standardized testing procedures from which an octane number is derived. Two accepted and standardized laboratory tests in general use to determine such octane numbers are: 1) The Research Method, which tests knock resistance under relatively mild, low-speed operating conditions (at 600 rpm with the air-fuel mixture entering at 125° F.); and 2) the Motor Method, which measures the octane number of a fuel under more extreme operating conditions (at 900 rpm with the air-fuel mixture at 300° F.).</p>
    <p id="b981-9" data-blocks='[["BL_981.9",981,[180,2327,1326,137]],["BL_982.1",982,[295,278,1327,703]]]'>While these measurements of the anti-knock properties of gasoline compositions provide a satisfactory rating scale, they do not fell the whole story. A gasoline composition may show very satisfactory <a id="p1658" href="#p1658" data-label="1658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1658</a>octane numbers by each method and yet may be unsatisfactory as an automobile motor fuel, since it may be utilized under widely varying-operating conditions which may not be accurately reflected in either the Research Method or the Motor Method of octane number determination. The same gasoline composition usually has different octane numbers when tested by the foregoing test methods. It has been found that the difference between the two (Research octane number minus the Motor octane number) may be used as a quantitative measure of the “sensitivity” of the gasoline, i.e., its performance under conditions other than those simulated in these two methods. Thus, a gasoline having a Research Method number of 99 and a Motor Method number of 91 has a sensitivity of 8. In evaluating sensitivity, the rule is that the lower the sensitivity number, the better is the over-all performance of the gasoline composition.</p>
    <p id="b982-4" data-blocks='[["BL_982.4",982,[297,988,1327,542]]]'>As automotive fuel octane ratings have risen to conform to the modern trend toward high-compression engines, so has the sensitivity. Appellant’s specification contains a table which purports to show the national average octane numbers and sensitivity of premium automotive gasolines for a number of years. This table shows the persistence of a problem in this art. It shoAvs that as the octane numbers of the gasolines Avere increased, the sensitivity number also increased. Thus as the octane numbers increased from 85.2 (Research) in 1941-42 to 98.4 in 1957-58, and from 79.7 (Motor) in 1941-42 to 87.9 in 1957-58, this increase resulted in a progressive increase of “sensitivity” of from 5.5 in 1941-42 to 10.5 in 1957-58.</p>
    <p id="b982-5" data-blocks='[["BL_982.5",982,[299,1545,1324,348]]]'>The significance of this progressive increase in gasoline sensitivity is apparent in view of modern design trends in automotive internal combustion engines. This is referred to in appellant’s specification Avhich points out that the “result of all these factors is that modern automotive engines are not only coming to require fuels of increased knock-resistance but are coming to require fuels of reduced sensitivity also.” Appellant then goes on to state:</p>
    <blockquote id="b982-6" data-blocks='[["BL_982.6",982,[302,1919,1323,75]]]'>The principal object of the present invention is to provide a commercially practical high-octane-number gasoline of low sensitivity. * * *</blockquote>

In an experiment described in the specification, 20 parts by volume of methyl tertiary-butyl ether were blended with 80 parts of a base gasoline containing 20% by volume of naphthenes, 47% by volume of aromatics, 1% by volume of olefins and 82% by volume of paraffins. Pure methyl tertiary-butyl ether alone has a Research Method octane number of 110.1, a Motor Method number of 100.6, and therefore has <a id="p1659" href="#p1659" data-label="1659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1659</a>sensitivity factor of 9.5. The corresponding numbers for the base gasoline mixture alone were found to be 97.1, 88.0 and 9.1 respectively. However, when the combination of these materials was tested, the Kesearch Method number was found to be 101.4, the Motor Method number was 93.6, and the sensitivity factor ivas 7.8. Appellant comments upon these results as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b983-4" data-blocks='[["BL_983.4",983,[180,585,1325,284]]]'>It is, of course, not suprising [sic] that the higher octane number ether raised both the Research and Motor Method octane numbers. However, it was unexpected to observe that the ether, having a <em>higher </em>sensitivity than the base gasoline, <em>loicered </em>the sensitivity of the base gasoline instead of raising it further, as is usually the case with conventional hydrocarbon blending gasoline components. But what is most surprising is the fact that the sensitivity of the bland [sic] was lower than <em>either </em>that of the ether or the base gasoline separately.</blockquote>

In brief, the art does not show that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art, under the test of section 103, to combine known ingredients to produce a new gasoline composition which is characterized by the unique and unobvious combination of high anti-knock properties with decreased sensitivity to engine operating conditions.</p>
