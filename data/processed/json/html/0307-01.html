    <p id="b343-24" data-blocks='[["BL_343.24",343,[960,1155,752,515]]]'>At about 10 p. m. on April 15, 1971, defendant asked Burton, his fellow employee at General Foods in Dover, to drive him to the nearby Elks Home during a work break. On the way, the pair was joined by Burton’s brother-in-law, Summers. When the trio arrived at the Elks Home, the defendant became argumentative and shot Burton in the leg. At this point, Summers tried to get out of the car, but the defendant refused to let him leave.</p>
    <p id="b343-25" data-blocks='[["BL_343.25",343,[960,1715,752,619]]]'>The defendant wanted to see his estranged wife but did not know where she was. He decided to go to Wilmington to try to find her. Since Burton was not in condition to drive, the defendant compelled Summers at gunpoint to drive them to Wilmington. After a stop at a service station, the defendant had Summers buy him some liquor while he remained in the car with Burton. Summers did not call the police while making the purchase since he was “too scared”. Summers then drove to his aunt’s house in Wilmington.</p>

Apparently fearing that Summers might call the police, the defendant ordered the still-untreated Burton to drive. After riding around Wilmington <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>for approximately one-half hour, the defendant forced Burton to drive him to his home in Suddlersville, Maryland.

People v.

    <p id="b344-13" data-blocks='[["BL_344.14",344,[1022,883,748,270]]]'>We have recently construed § 623 as requiring the element of criminal intent. Wilson v.

Prior to 1958, the penalty for kidnapping was death. 1935 Code § 5174. That sentence was mandatory; only tem<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>porary reprieve of the execution of the sentence by the Governor was permitted. 11 Del.C. § 3910. Effective April, 1958, the penalty for kidnapping was reduced to life imprisonment. 51 Laws, Ch. 347, § 3. This change was concomitant with the legislative elimination of the death penalty for first degree murder. Cf. 51 Laws, Ch. 347, § 2. It is thus manifest that the Legislature then intended the penalty for kidnapping to be the same as that for first degree murder. The penalty for first degree murder must be as great or greater than the penalty for second degree murder. State v. Dickerson, Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/298/0761-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="298 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="11253756" data-case-paths="/a2d/298/0761-01">298 A.2d 761</a> (Supplemental Opinion, 1973).
