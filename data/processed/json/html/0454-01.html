    <p id="b510-20" data-blocks='[["BL_510.19",510,[986,1505,753,1195]]]'>Appellee was charged in a four-count indictment with one count of rape while armed, two counts of rape, and one count of assault with a dangerous weapon. According to the indictment, defendant was charged with raping two different women on different days — the incidents were about a month apart — but in the same apartment building and under similar circumstances. Appellee moved for severance of counts one through three (relating to the first alleged rape) from count four (relating to the second alleged rape). The court granted the motion over the government’s opposition. Immediately following this ruling, the government asked the court if, in separate trials, the evidence of each offense would be admissible in the trial of the other. The court ruled that the evidence of one offense would not be admissible in the trial of the other to show a “common scheme or plan”, the theory advanced by the government. A continuance of the scheduled trial was granted so that an appeal could be taken from this ruling.</p>

That section states:</p>

This is a plausible argument if one confines the analysis to the very broad phrase added in 1970. We cannot agree, however, that Congress intended to expand the right of the government to appeal from the granting of a suppression motion to an absolute right of appeal from any pretrial ruling on such issues as the relevancy or prejudice of evidence or testimony to be offered at trial.</p>

(1970) (hereinafter House Report), of the Committee on the District of Columbia specifically mentions the language added to § 23-104(a)(1) by Pub.L. No. 91-358. It states at 111:</p>
    <blockquote id="b511-10" data-blocks='[["BL_511.11",511,[1001,1356,717,861]]]'>Section 23-104(a)(l) substantially reenacts existing section 23-105 (b) of the District of Columbia Code, relating to the prosecution’s rights to appeal pretrial ruling.

The government had petitioned for reopening upon the allegation of newly discovered evidence. The trial court denied the motion and the government noted <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>an appeal under <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 3731">18 U.S.C. § 3731</a> (1970), the language of which is substantially the same as that of the 1969 provision in § 23-105 (b), <em>supra. </em>Section 3731 provides for a government appeal “[f]rom an order, granting a motion for return of seized property or a motion to suppress evidence, made before the trial . . . .” The court in <em>Greely </em>held that it was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal since the appeal was not literally from a motion to suppress, but rather from the denial of a motion to reopen the suppression hearing.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[191,928,763,1434]]]'>Thus, it might be concluded that the purpose of the additional language in § 23-104(a)(1) was solely to overcome the effect of the <em>Greely </em>holding, and cannot be extended to cover the evidentiary determination made in the instant case. However, we need not turn our decision on that rationale, for, when the nature of the trial court’s action is analyzed, it can be seen that the fundamental prerequisite to ap-pealable action is absent. Section 23-104(a)(1) permits an appeal from “an order”. Significantly, other subsections of § 23-104 which were added to expand the government’s right to appeal (in the 1970 Act) used a different characterization of appealable action. Sections 23-104(b) and (d) permit, under very limited circumstances, appeals during trial from “ruling[s]”. The distinction is crucial. These subsections permit appeals from rulings only under specified, guarded conditions. In subsection (b) the ruling must be grounded on a holding that the evidence “was invalidly obtained”. In subsection (d) an appeal from “any other ruling” which involves “a substantial and recurring question of law which requires appellate resolution” may be taken, but “only with leave of the court.”</p>
