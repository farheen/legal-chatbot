    <p id="b523-17" data-blocks='[["BL_523.17",523,[970,419,752,1749]]]'>This is an appeal by a juvenile, D.H., <em>from </em>an adjudication of delinquency upon a finding of guilt of second-degree murder while armed with a dangerous weapon (D.C.Code §§ 22-2403, -3202) (1989 Repl. &amp; 1993 Supp.), carrying an unlicensed pistol (D.C.Code § 22-3204) (1989 Repl. <em>&amp; </em>1993 Supp.), and possession of a firearm and ammunition without a valid registration certificate (D.C.Code § 6-2311) (1995 Repl.). D.H.’s principal argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the twenty-one month interval between the date of the homicide and the trial violated his due process right to a speedy trial in that the delay prejudiced his ability to present an adequate defense and deprived him of the benefit of rehabilitation in the juvenile system. D.H. also argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a confession obtained by the police while he was in custody and outside of the presence of his parent or legal counsel in violation of Super.Ct.Juv.R. 105(f). We hold that a juvenile has a due process right to a fair trial, including a speedy one, consistent with the statutory purpose of the juvenile code, but consonant with the goals of protection of the child and the community. However, on the particular facts of this case, we find no violation of D.H.’s rights which warrants reversal. Concluding that Super.Ct.Juv.R. 105(f) is inapplicable under the circumstances presented, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress statements. Therefore, we affirm.</p>

There was an inaccuracy in the records of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) which listed D.H.’s birth year as 1972 instead of 1973, thus making it appear that he was sixteen years old at the time of the murder. At the time Detective Sullivan obtained the warrant, D.H. had one delinquency case pending in the Family Division of Superior Court, and he was committed to the Department of Human Services (DHS) in another. D.H. was arrested again as a juvenile on November 11, 1989, in an unrelated matter. In the latter case, the trial court ordered that D.H. be detained at the Children’s Center, a detention facility for children.</p>

At the initial hearing in the Family Division that same day, an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia (ACC) requested a “five day hold” on filing a petition charging D.H. because the Corporation Counsel’s Office had received the case from the United States Attorney’s Office just one to two days earlier and required time to investigate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The ACC specifically stated that the reason for the request was “because we have to go over everything that’s been done charging him.

When the case was recalled, the ACC represented that the government would not file a petition at that time and requested the court to hold D.H. “on the two eases that he’s detained in.” The trial court stated, “I think that closes the jacket. And, you can refile the petition if you want to, when you want to file it.” The trial court entered an order detaining D.H. at the Children’s Center in the two unrelated juvenile cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The official record card listed D.H.’s date of birth as September 3, 1972, and based on that record card, Detective Sullivan calculated D.H.’s age as sixteen years old at the time of the homicide.

Detective Sullivan picked D.H. up at the courthouse on the felony warrant and took him to the Homicide Division. Mr. Randolph Baker, the Assistant Superintendent at the Cedar Knoll Youth Center, testified that the Center was required to comply with a court-issued arrest warrant for a juvenile.

Assuming for the sake of argument that a juvenile has a due process right to rehabilitative treatment, the circumstances do not support the claim of that particular prejudice in this case. At the time of the commission of the offense and at the time that the case was dismissed initially, D.H. was already a committed juvenile, and he had another case pending.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> He was arrested as a juvenile in <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>an unrelated case on November 11, 1989 and detained. Following revocation of his probation in a prior case where he had been adjudicated delinquent, he remained in committed status at the Children’s Center until the commitment expired August 1990.

While this approach has some appeal, in the context of evaluation of a juvenile’s claim of denial of due process, it is unworkable because not every case will result in actual prejudice of the type which rises to the level of denial of due process. Therefore, the facts and circumstances of each case must be examined to determine the nature of any claimed deprivation and the extent of the prejudice. Here, appellant has shown no actual prejudice resulting from the delay of some six months between the time that he was released from his prior commitment and the time that the petition was filed and the trial held. Appellant points out that he was almost eighteen at the time of the disposition in this case, and whatever services were provided him at that time would not be an adequate substitute for what he would have received if the adjudication had occurred closer to the time that he committed the offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a> We cannot dispose of the issue on this assumption.

First, considering the length of the delay, eliminating from the equation the time that no charges were pending in this case against appellant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> the interval between the filing of the petition and trial was not unduly lengthy. Second, the reasons for the government’s delay were found to be negligent and not deliberate and for the purpose of gaining some tactical advantage; therefore, such delay would fall within an intermediate category between neutral and more culpable and weigh less heavily against the government. <em>See Graves, <a href="/a2d/490/1086-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="490 A.2d 1086" data-case-ids="7911918" data-case-paths="/a2d/490/1086-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/490/1086-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="490 A.2d 1086" data-case-ids="7911918" data-case-paths="/a2d/490/1086-01">490 A.2d at 1092</a>. Third, appellant has not shown actual prejudice as a result of the delay. The fourth factor, assertion of the right, does not weigh significantly in appellant’s favor. Although appellant moved to dismiss the charges because the government delayed in petitioning the case from February 1990 to February 1991, appellant did not move for a prompt trial. The failure to move for a prompt trial as an alternative to dismissal weakens a speedy trial claim on appeal. <em>Id, </em>at 1101. Thus, balancing the <em>Barker </em>factors, and considering the objectives of the juvenile system, we <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>cannot say that appellant is entitled to dismissal of the case on due process grounds for denial of a speedy trial. While not condoning the government’s delay in petitioning this serious case, on this record, for the reasons previously stated, we find no basis for reversal of the trial court’s order denying dismissal.</p>

D.H. contends that the trial court erred in construing Rule 105 too narrowly as applying only to interviews conducted on the grounds of the Children’s Center and in failing to exercise discretion under its supervisory power to sanction a violation of a court rule, even in the absence of a constitutional violation.

After discovering that D.H. was under commitment to DHS, Detective Sullivan arranged to have D.H. “brought up” to the court by Children’s Center transportation for service of the arrest warrant. Detective Sullivan picked up D.H. from the court and took him to the Homicide Division of the MPD where D.H. waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a PD-47 waiver of rights card. D.H. agreed to give the police a statement and confessed to the shooting of Judith Krunklin. The detective did not obtain permission from the Family Division, D.H.’s parents or his lawyers in other pending cases. Randolph Baker, the Assistant Superintendent at the Cedar Knoll Youth Center, testified that D.H.’s “Plan of the Day” on November 20,1989 was to go to court on an unrelated offense and to see his attorney at the receiving home.
