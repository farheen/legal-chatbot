Defendants Susan Keene and James Earle, Jr., also licensed EMTs, are employees of the business. On January 19, 1982, pursuant to regulations promulgated under the authority of 32 M.R.S.A. §§ 71-75 (1978) <em>repealed and replaced by </em>P.L. 1981, ch. 661, §§ 1, 2 (effective July 13, 1982), the Department of Human Services (DHS) filed a statement of complaint with the Administrative Court Judge to revoke the EMT licenses of each of the defendants and the ambulance license of defendant James Earle, Sr. DHS appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court (York County) affirming the judgment for the defendants entered by the Administrative Court Judge.

According to the log entries of Earle’s Ambulance Service, the patient went into cardiac arrest at 6:11 p.m. and the ambulance arrived at the hospital at 6:14 p.m. Florence Fogg was in full cardiac arrest upon arrival. Although she was revived by hospital personnel, brain function had ceased. Several witnesses at the hospital testified in the proceedings before the Administrative Court Judge that the patient was not receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when the ambulance arrived. When Dr. Eugene Andes, Medical Director of Emergency Services at York Hospital, inquired about the incident, James Earle, Sr. stated “that the patient had had a cardiac or cardio-respiratory arrest so near to the hospital that it had not seemed appropriate to institute CPR since it was a matter of a few minutes until the patient would be at the hospital.”</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.10",237,[206,1794,745,86]],["BL_237.11",237,[1005,255,750,943]]]'>The second incident at issue concerned Scott Brown who, on March 23, 1982, was rendered unconscious when the raised body of a dump truck fell on his neck. The three defendants responded to the accident and transported Scott Brown in an Earle’s Ambulance to the York Hospital emergency room. A person at the scene of the accident, herself a licensed EMT, testified that she told defendant Susan Keene that Scott Brown may have suffered a neck injury. Several York Hospital emergency room personnel testified that the defendants informed them that Scott Brown had suffered a neck and head injury. Witnesses also testified that the defendants did not stabilize the patient’s neck. Scott Brown became a quadriplegic as a result of a cervical spinal cord injury. One possible cause of such an injury is the failure to stabilize the cervical spine after a neck injury.</p>

With regard to full arrest situations, Dr. Marshall Chamberlin, Director of the Emergency Department of the Kenne-bec Valley Medical Center, testified that in only the following three situations would CPR not be initiated: where the victim is decapitated; where there is obvious rigor mortis — stiffening of the muscles which evidence that the person has been dead for a period of some time; and where there is <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>obvious rigor livedous — a pooling of the blood that causes a bluish discoloration of the skin and which also indicates that the victim has been dead for an extended period of time. He also testified that CPR, once initiated, would be discontinued by an EMT only when circulation and respiration returned, when the person performing CPR is exhausted, or when he turned over the care of the patient to someone who is equally or better qualified to continue CPR. The testimony of Robert Tredwell, a licensed EMT and instructor of EMT courses, corroborated that of Dr. Chamber-lin. He added, however, that an EMT also would discontinue CPR when instructed to do so by a doctor. Finally, with regard to situations involving possible neck injury, Dr. Chamberlin, Mr. Tredwell, and Mary Andrews, a registered nurse and instructor of EMT courses, each testified that because of the attendant risks of a neck injury, an EMT must assume that any unconscious patient has sustained such an injury and must stabilize the patient’s neck.</p>

The Administrative Court Judge treated the motion as a motion for judgment pursuant to M.Admin.C.R. 50,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">5</a> and entered judgment for the defendants.

By holding that the record was “entirely devoid of evidence that the failure to meet or to perform those procedures fell below a minimally acceptable standard of care which should be delivered by emergency medical technicians in the day-to-day conduct of their affairs,” the Administrative Court Judge ruled on the legal sufficiency of the evidence.

In the present case, there was expert testimony regarding the kind of care that EMT’s are trained to give to patients in full cardiac arrest and to patients with suspected neck injuries. Other testimony described the defendants’ actions in the two incidents in question. The Administrative Court Judge could conclude from the medical and lay testimony that the failure to perform CPR in the cardiac arrest case and to immobilize the neck in a situation where cervical injury was suspected constituted conduct which fell below the legal standard of performing at a minimally accepted level of competence. In so doing he could appropriately apply the legal standard to the medical testimony. It was unnecessary for the plaintiff to elicit specific expert opinion that the defendants’ actions were “something less than the minimally accepted level of learning and skill in the day to day practice of [the profession].” Although such testimony that defendants failed to meet the <em>legal </em>standard may not be an inappropriate opinion on an “ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact,” <em>see </em>Field &amp; Murray, <em>Maine Evidence </em>§ 704.1 at 178-9 (1976), its omission here did not diminish the <em>prima facie </em>case against the defendants.
