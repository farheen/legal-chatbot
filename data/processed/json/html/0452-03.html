The lake is used by the public for boating and other water activities. Appellants, York Haven Power Company and Metropolitan Edison Company, erected the dam in question. On April 30, 1994, Kenneth Stone and Lynn Meinsler were boating on Lake Frederick. During the late afternoon and evening of that date, the two men drank alcoholic beverages at different locations around the lake, ending at the Falls Hotel with friends. At approximately 11:30 p.m., the two men and their friends left the Falls Hotel and returned to their various boats. While on the lake, one of the men who departed the Falls Hotel by boat at the same time Stone and Meinsler departed in their boat was passed by a boat that he believed to be Meinsler’s, which was headed toward the area where appellants’ dam is located. It was raining heavily by this time, and visibility was very poor. The following day, Meinsler’s boat was found lodged in the main channel dam, and both Stone and Meinsler were drowned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Lake Frederick is neither like the indoor swimming pool at issue in <em>Rivera, </em>nor like the natural pond in <em>Lory. </em>It is somewhere in between. The “lake” exists only because the dam was built. Before the dam was built, a navigable watercourse, the Susquehanna River, was flowing at the same location in a free and natural state. If the river still existed in its original, natural state, or if the present-day lake existed independent of the dam, there would be no question that the waterway was subject to RUA immunity. Our analysis here, however, must account for the unavoidable fact of the dam.</p>

This Court has had the benefit of briefs filed by amici curiae, which reveal that lakes or reservoirs created by the damming of a waterway are common phenomena in Pennsylvania. Water suppliers throughout the Commonwealth own reservoirs, created by damming or obstructing the natural flow of water in rivers, streams, lakes and other natural surface sources, as a method of creating and holding a reserve supply of water for private or public purposes. These reservoirs are often open to the public free of charge, and they are ideal spots for fishing, hunting, swimming, boating, and other water-oriented recreational activities. Absent the immunity provided by the RUA, the owners of such bodies of water would be significantly discouraged from opening them to the public for fear of liability arising from risks inherent in those watersports.
