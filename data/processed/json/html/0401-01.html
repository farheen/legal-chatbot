Obviously, it would disrupt such calendars if the judge, in order to hold a:i immediate hearing, were required to set aside all pending business to review the conditions of probation, to ascertain whether the original defense counsel was available, and if not, appoint one, and then |to set a time for hearing which both prosecution and defense lawyers, to say nothing of witnesses, could attend. Such preparation on the part of a trial judge requires both time and thought. We do not regard it as unreasonable for judges faced vjdth the dilemma of either abandoning their own trial schedules or letting a probationary term expire, to issue an order extenjding probation temporarily provided the probationer is given an opportunity to be heard with the assistance of counsel before deprivation of liberty or the imposition of more onerous conditions of probation is ultimately ordered.</p>

Not having been raised in the proceeding below, this court would ordinarily disregard it under the familiar rule that an appellate court will not consider objections not made in the trial court.
