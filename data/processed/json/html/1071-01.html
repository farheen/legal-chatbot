    <p id="b1102-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1102.13",1102,[1008,536,751,807]]]'>The record on appeal shows that Scoville previously owned property located at 421 Massachusetts Avenue and 423 Massachusetts Avenue, in the'Northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. Scoville was once solely owned by Jerry Sills. During Jerry Sills’ sole ownership, municipal liens were placed against both properties due to nonpayment of taxes for tax years 1992 through 1995. As a result of the unpaid liens, the properties were bid off and sold to the District of Columbia, which assigned its tax liens on both properties to District TLC in October 1996. Both tax lien certificates representing the assignments were recorded on November 20,1996.</p>

On March 6 and 7, 1997, Scoville was sent notice by certified mail that it had thirty days in which to pay the delinquent taxes and to redeem the respective properties, or to face foreclosure. When the taxes were not paid, District TLC'filed separate but virtually identical civil actions against Scoville on June 4, 1997, seeking to foreclose on the tax liens for both properties, and to preclude Scoville “from all equity of redemption in and to” the properties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">2</a> Scoville did not lodge an answer to the <a id="p1073" href="#p1073" data-label="1073" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1073</a>complaint relating to the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue that is the subject of the case before us. Rather, Kevin Sills, as agent for Scoville, filed a disclaimer in August 1997, which states in relevant part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1103.5",1103,[189,538,713,431]]]'>Defendant Kevin Sills, authorized agent on behalf of Scoville ..., hereby disclaims any and all rights, title, interest, lien or claim in or to the described real property that is the subject matter of this pleading [423 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.], and hereby declares that he will not defend said defendant in this action.</blockquote>

    <p id="b1103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1103.7",1103,[148,1150,754,1535]]]'>Kevin Sills signed a disclaimer not only for the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue, but also for the property at 421 Massachusetts Avenue. Prior to signing the disclaimers, he had performed a title search, and honestly believed that Scoville had no title to either property. However, he learned just prior to the trial court’s March 1998 order that Scoville remained the record owner of the property at 421 Massachusetts Avenue. In April 1998, after Kevin Sills learned of the mistake regarding 421 Massachusetts Avenue, the parties filed a consent motion to strike the disclaimer. Subsequently, District TLC filed a motion for default judgment which was granted in March 1998 by the trial court. In its March 1998 order, the trial court declared that Scoville was “barred and foreclosed of and from all equity and right of redemption in and to the [property,” and further, that District TLC “shall.. .have the sole right to seek a[t]ax [d]eed for the [property....” District TLC received the deed on March 24, 1998, but did not record it until February 14, 2001. In January 2001, prior to District TLC’s recordation of the deed, Kevin Sills learned through the Urban Fund that Sco-ville remained the record owner of 423 Massachusetts Avenue.</p>
    <p id="b1103-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1103.8",1103,[951,284,752,970]]]'>On May 15, 2001, approximately three months after the tax deed for 423 Massachusetts Avenue was recorded, Scoville brought suit against District TLC and others, including the District of Columbia government, seeking to “set aside” the tax deed. Paragraph 12 of Scoville’s complaint alleged that it had “mistakenly disclaimed any interest in and to the [property,” and paragraph 13 asserted that: “Such mistake relates to the death of the prior owner of [Scoville], the succession to the ownership of [Scoville] by the current owner thereof and a complete confusion as to the title to the [p]roperty.” Three days after filing its lawsuit against District TLC, Scoville and District TLC settled the latter’s lawsuit pertaining to 421 Massachusetts Avenue.</p>

About one month later, on January 10, 2002, Scoville filed a motion to enforce an alleged settlement agreement which it claimed had been agreed to orally by the parties. Scoville maintained that the alleged oral agreement did not violate the Statute of Frauds. In addition, Scoville requested “discovery and [ ] an evidentiary hearing on [its] Motion.” On February 14, 2003, the trial court denied Scoville’s motion to enforce settlement agreement; granted District TLC’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, treating it as a motion for summary judgment; and dismissed Scoville’s complaint with prejudice. Scoville filed a timely appeal.</p>

Ct. Civ. R. 12(c), District TLC referenced Scoville’s complaint, the amended answer of the defendants, and the exhibits attached to the amended answer. These exhibits included the March 6 and 7, 1997 certified mail letters to Scoville containing notices as to the amount of delinquent taxes then due on the respective Massachusetts Avenue properties and the time period for redemption (thirty days); District TLC’s complaints against Scoville pertaining to the Massachusetts Avenue properties; the results of a title search relating to the Massachusetts Avenue properties in question showing the recording of a tax lien certificate for each property on November 20, 1996; a copy of Kevin Sills’ August 1997 disclaimer and the dismissal of District TLC’s lawsuit against Scoville with regard to the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property; and the trial court’s March 1998 order granting District TLC’s motion for default judgment with respect to its lawsuit against Scoville, as to the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property. Attached to Scoville’s opposition to District TLC’s motion for judgment on the pleadings were affidavits from Kevin Sills regarding his disclaimer of interest in the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue, and his subsequent contract for the sale of that property, and from Karl Rice, Jerry Sills’ attorney, who explained the difficulties in determining Jerry Sills’ assets; a praecipe settling District TLC’s suit against Scoville pertaining to the 421 Massachusetts Avenue property; and an April 27, 2001 letter from Scoville’s attorney to District TLC’s attorney seeking to redeem the property at 423 Massachusetts Avenue, as it had done with respect to the property at 421 Massachusetts Avenue.</p>

Rule 12(c) expressly states that under such circumstances the motion for judgment on the pleadings “shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 .... ” Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(c). We have stated previously that “[t]he language of Rule 12 is mandatory.” <em>Foretich v.

Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court was required to treat District TLC’s motion as one for summary judgment. The question thus is whether Scoville had “reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.” Not only did Scoville have an opportunity to present all pertinent material, but it attached numerous exhibits to its opposition to District TLC’s motion, including affidavits. In light of these submissions by Scoville, the trial court was not obligated to give specific notice of its intent to treat District TLC’s motion as one for summary judgment, because Sco-ville had constructive notice that the Rule 12(c) motion might be converted to one for summary judgment; thus, any lack of additional notice did not prejudice Scoville. <em>See San Pedro Hotel Co. v.

Furthermore, nothing in the record shows that Seoville requested more time to present additional exhibits or affidavits.

In light of § 47-1308.04(0(2) and (4) and the trial court’s order of March 1998, granting District TLC’s motion for default judgment against Scoville in its 1997 lawsuit, Scoville’s arguments cannot prevail in the case before us. Sco-ville was notified by certified mail on March 7, 1997, that taxes were outstanding on the 423 Massachusetts Avenue property and that it had thirty days in which to pay the outstanding taxes and to redeem the property, to avoid foreclosure. As the trial court determined in its March 1998 order, “It is uncontroverted that all record owners and lienholders of record were previously provided adequate notice and opportunity to redeem the property.” <em>See Associated Estates, LLC v.

Moreover, the District government’s assignment of tax liens, including that relating to 423 Massachusetts Avenue, was recorded on November 20, 1996, and thus was a public document, readily available for inspection.

This is so because there is another reason why summary judgment was properly granted: the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>or claim preclusion. “ ‘Under the doctrine of claim preclusion or <em>res judicata, </em>when a valid final judgment has been entered on the merits, the parties or those in privity with them are barred, in a subsequent proceeding, from relitigating the same claim that might have been raised in <a id="p1077" href="#p1077" data-label="1077" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1077</a>the first proceeding.’ ” <em>Newell v.

The trial court’s ruling in District TLC’s 1997 lawsuit against Sco-ville, concluding that as to 423 Massachusetts Avenue, Scoville was “barred and foreclosed of and from all equity and right of redemption in and to the [pjroperty,” is barred by <em>res judicata </em>for purposes of the instant litigation. Seoville’s lawsuit against District TLC involves the same parties, District TLC and Scoville; the same property; and the same disclaimer of interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue as in the 1997 lawsuit brought by District TLC against Scoville. Consequently, it is barred by claim preclusion or <em>res judicata. See Smith v.

This agreement reportedly set up “a procedure through which [District TLC’s servicing agent, Breen Capital Corporation] would solicit bids for the 423[p]roper-ty from the public and then allow Scoville to match the highest bid received as part of this process.” Scoville terms the agreement “a right to match agreement.” Regardless of the appellation, the oral agreement in essence would be more than a simple settlement contract. Rather, it would be described properly as an oral contract for the redemption of an interest in land by Scoville.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">5</a> The redemption process would require Scoville to pay District TLC $475,000 and in turn District TLC would transfer title to 423 Massachusetts Avenue to Scoville. Moreover, with the redemption Scoville would be able to convey its interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue to Urban Opportunity Fund, LLC with whom Scoville had signed a contract on January 23, 2001, for the sale of 423 Massachusetts Avenue, or possibly could <a id="p1078" href="#p1078" data-label="1078" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1078</a>execute a contract of sale with some other purchaser. As such, the oral agreement clearly would fall within the District’s Statute of Frauds which applies to “a contract or sale of real estate, of any interest in or concerning it .... ” D.C.Code § 28-3502 (2001); <em>see also Griese-Traylor Corp. v.

The trial court assumed that there may have been an oral right to match agreement concerning Scoville’s purchase of the property for $475,000, but the court correctly concluded that even if such an oral agreement did exist, it could not be enforced under the Statute of Frauds, without some evidence of a written agreement, or partial or complete performance under the alleged oral contract. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 28-3502 (2001) (“An action may not be brought ... upon a contract or sale of real estate ... unless the agreement upon which the action is brought, ... is in writing .... ”); <em>see also Railan v.

Scoville's contrary argument that its suit to set aside the deed and the 1988 lawsuit to quiet title were different causes of action with "differing factual nuclei” rests ultimately on the claim that through no lack of diligence on its part, its 1997 disclaimer of interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue was mistaken, and that eventual discovery of this mistake relieved it of the consequences of the 1998 judgment. <em>See Short v. District of Columbia Dep't of Employment Servs., </em><a href="/a2d/723/0845-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="723 A.2d 845" data-case-ids="11771426" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0845-01">723 A.2d 845</a>, 849 (D.C.1998) ("[R]es <em>judicata </em>does not apply to a situation where the basis for a second claim could not have been discovered with due diligence.”). Yet, prior to the termination of the tax foreclosure action relating to 423 Massachusetts Avenue, Scoville determined that it had an interest in 421 Massachusetts Avenue, which is adjacent to 423 Massachusetts Avenue and hence should have been alerted to the possibility of a similar interest in 423 Massachusetts Avenue. In addition, the extensive property action in this area of the city should have led Scoville to inquire about 423 Massachusetts Avenue. <em>See Berkow v. Hayes Nat. Training School, </em><a href="/a2d/841/0776-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="841 A.2d 776" data-case-ids="9285948" data-case-paths="/a2d/841/0776-01">841 A.2d 776</a>, 781 (D.C.2004).
