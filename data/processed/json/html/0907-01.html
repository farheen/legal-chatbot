We conclude that the statute does not require the Commonwealth’s attorney to state on the record his or her reasons for rejecting a defendant for Section 118 treatment. Finding that none of appellant’s claims has merit, we affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>

The Chief referred Boulous to the state police in order to avoid a conflict in investigating one of his own officers. State troopers interviewed Boulous and asked him to call appellant and inquire whether he could obtain more marijuana. Boulous called appellant from the troopers’ barracks and asked appellant to get him some marijuana to relieve back pain he had been experiencing. Appellant replied that he did not have marijuana at that time but would look into securing some for Boulous. Later that same day, appellant appeared at Boulous’s home and explained that he could get some marijuana and would return with it soon.</p>

The troopers came to Bou-lous’s residence and waited in his workshop for appellant to return. Later, appellant came back to Boulous’s house and, while in Boulous’s driveway, informed him that he had the marijuana and that it cost $60. Bou-lous went to his workshop where he received <a id="p910" href="#p910" data-label="910" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*910</a>$60 in marked bills from one of the troopers. He then went outside to appellant and exchanged the money for a bag containing 5.5 grams of marijuana. Appellant asked Bou-lous if he could take a “pinch” for himself and Boulous agreed. Appellant then took a small amount of the marijuana and began to leave. Boulous returned to the troopers and handed one of them the bag appellant had delivered. The troopers immediately approached appellant, placed him under arrest and found on his person $60 in marked bills and a small amount of marijuana.</p>

This statute provides nonviolent drug abusers a single opportunity to avoid criminal prosecution while at the same time receive treatment for a problem that contributed to their criminal conduct.

Appellant claims that it was error for the Commonwealth attorney to make such a choice without placing his reasons on the record. The Commonwealth argues that the statute contains no such requirement. Analogizing Section 118 to the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition Program (ARD), <em>see </em>Pa. R.Crim.P. 175-186, appellant asserts that the district attorney should be required to state his reasons for rejection on the record. Despite the fact that in ARD matters the district attorney has discretion to accept or reject a candidate, our supreme court has imposed upon Commonwealth attorneys the responsibility of stating on the record their reasons for rejecting a defendant seeking ARD. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Instead, it chose to eliminate entirely the requirement of stating the reasons underlying a rejection.

His argument is based primarily on the fact that at the time of the transaction, appellant claimed he was charging Boulous the same amount of money he paid for the substance, <em>i.e., </em>was not making a profit. Appellant draws our attention to 35 PS. § 780-113(a)(31), which punishes (to a lesser degree than the delivery statute) the distribution, but not sale, of a small amount of marijuana. Essentially, appellant argues that the government charged the wrong crime. We disagree. Section 780-113(a)(30) does not require that a party make a profit, it simply prohibits “delivery.” Delivery is defined as “the actual, constructive or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance_” 35 PS. § 780-102.
