Young, Sr. (applicant or Young), appeals <em>pro se </em>from the Superior Court’s denial of his application for post-conviction relief. Young was convicted of three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault on September 20, 1996. He was sentenced to forty-five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions on each count, to run concurrently, with twenty years to serve, and the balance suspended, with probation. This Court affirmed his convictions in <em>State v. Young, </em><a href="/a2d/743/1032-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="743 A.2d 1032" data-case-ids="11494064" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/1032-01">743 A.2d 1032</a> (R.I.2000), which <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>contains a thorough recitation of the facts underlying the convictions.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[143,398,754,1591]]]'>Young filed a <em>pro se </em>application for post-conviction relief, together with a motion for appointment of counsel in Superior Court. An attorney was appointed, and he duly entered his appearance on Young’s behalf. Young’s counsel reviewed the arguments that Young sought to raise in his application and filed a motion to amend the application for post-conviction relief, which was granted. In his amended application, Young said that: (1) his trial counsel did not provide effective assistance of counsel because he failed to present two witnesses, a Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) social caseworker and a police officer, both of whom would have corroborated the victim’s earlier admission that she denied ever having been molested by applicant; (2) his appellate counsel failed to raise issues on appeal about the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and the denial of his motion for a new trial; and (3) there was a substantial un-derrepresentation of minorities in the jury pool. Thereafter, Young’s counsel filed a “no-merit” memorandum, pursuant to <em>Shatney v. State, </em><a href="/a2d/755/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="755 A.2d 130" data-case-ids="11200839" data-case-paths="/a2d/755/0130-01">755 A.2d 130</a> (R.I.2000), in which he deemed the claim with respect to the racial mixture of the jury pool and the “miscellaneous averments” raised by Young to be without merit.</p>
    <p id="b655-6" data-blocks='[["BL_655.6",655,[143,2015,751,560]]]'>Both sides subsequently moved for summary judgment. At the summary judgment hearing, Young’s counsel argued the issues of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to call the aforementioned witnesses and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to appeal the denial of Young’s motion for a new trial, while Young pressed the issue of the racial composition of the jury and his “miscellaneous issues” <em>pro se.</em>

The hearing justice found no ineffective assistance on the part of Young’s trial counsel for failing to present the testimony of the DCYF social caseworker and the police officer, who would have testified that the victim initially said that Young had not assaulted her. The hearing justice found that the testimony would not have assisted applicant in this matter because the victim acknowledged in her testimony that she had lied to the initial investigators, and thus “the issue was fully explored and the jury did have the evidence that [applicant] was seeking to get before the jury, namely, that there were two diametrically opposed statements by this girl.” Similarly, the hearing justice found that Young’s appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to appeal the denial of the motion for a new trial. The hearing justice noted that the trial justice found the victim’s uncontradicted testimony credible and that the evidence applicant asserts would support granting the motion for a new trial would not have contradicted the victim’s testimony. Thus, the appellate counsel could not be faulted for declining to appeal an essentially frivolous argument.</p>

The hearing justice first noted that there was “nothing before me indicating some pattern of impropriety on behalf of the State * * * that would indicate some racial animosity or prejudice * * The applicant then averred that he was prejudiced by statements a juror made during the trial, and that this was not addressed by the Supreme Court in his previous appeal. The hearing justice said that the briefs from the previous appeal were not before him and that he was unable to understand applicant’s remaining arguments. The hearing justice continued the hearing to allow Young to refine his arguments and <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>provide the court with any supporting materials.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[215,405,755,1547]]]'>On May 6, 2002, an order was entered granting partial summary judgment to the state on the arguments of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, and systematic exclusion of a minority group. On June 10, 2002, the hearing resumed. The hearing justice rejected Young’s assertion that the trial justice should have declared a mistrial because of prejudicial comments a juror made. The hearing justice noted that the trial justice removed from the jury the juror who made the offending remarks, conducted an individual <em>voir dire </em>on the remaining jurors, and that the Supreme Court, on appeal, approved the trial justice’s handling of the matter. The applicant then spontaneously asserted that only eleven jurors had deliberated in this case; however, after examining the transcripts and determining that twelve jurors actually had deliberated, the hearing justice rejected this argument. The hearing justice also addressed the remaining issues and concluded that “[njothing has been presented to me that shows that post-conviction relief is warranted.” On June 12, 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the state, and Young filed a pro se notice of appeal.</p>

Because the two diametrically opposed statements by the victim were fully explored at trial, appellate counsel could not be faulted for failing to appeal this issue.

In the underlying case, the trial justice deemed the victim to be completely credible and denied applicant’s motion for a new trial. “If the trial justice denies the motion after articulating an adequate rationale, the decision will be affirmed by this Court unless it is clearly wrong or unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived evidence that was relevant and material and that was critical to an issue in the case.” <em><a href="/a2d/871/0930-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="871 A.2d 930" data-case-ids="8980632" data-case-paths="/a2d/871/0930-01">Id.</a> </em>The applicant has put forth no evidence demonstrating that the trial justice’s decision was clearly wrong or that she overlooked or misconceived evidence that was relevant and material and that was critical to an issue in this case.
