To secure this debt, Primestone pledged 7,944,893 limited partnership units (the “Units”) of Prime Group Realty, L.P. (“PGRLP”).

PGE’s main asset is partnership units in PGRLP. For each partnership unit owned by PGE, there is one common share of PGE outstanding. The Units themselves do not entitle the holder to any voting rights in relation to PGE, and only limited voting rights with respect to PGRLP.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The exchangeability of the Units into PGE shares is further limited by PGE’s Declaration of Trust, which prohibits any one investor from holding more than 9.9% of PGE stock without the consent of PGE’s Board of Trustees (the “PGE Board”).

Pursuant to Section 4 of the Vornado Loan Agreement, the Vornado Loan matured on October 25, 2001, at the latest. The Vornado Loan also contained a “no shop” provision that prohibited Primestone, during the term of the Loan and for thirty days thereafter, from discussing or soliciting a refinancing without the written consent of Vornado. Further, the Loan contained a “right of first offer” provision, which provided that if Primestone sought to arrange for refinancing of the Loan with a third party, Vornado had the first right to match the proposed refinancing arrangement and thereby supersede the new lender. The Vornado Loan was made, in part, due to ongoing negotiations between Primestone and Vornado related to a possible joint venture with or acquisition of Primestone by Vornado.

Several meetings were held related to the Loan around October 10 and 11. Vornado, however, told Primestone that it would not extend the Loan unless Prime-stone repaid at least a part of it. Prime-stone did not agree to such a “pay down,” and the parties never agreed to extend the Loan.

It hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a prominent investment banking firm, to assist it in developing a marketing process and identifying potential purchasers of the Units. Because the Units were not subject to an established trading market, Vornado believed Section 9 — 610(c) of the New York Uniform Commercial Code prohibited Vor-nado from buying the Units unless they were sold in a public sale. Vornado wanted an opportunity to purchase the Units and felt it might be the most willing and able potential purchaser of the Units. As a result, Vornado decided that Goldman Sachs’s efforts to market the Units would culminate in a public auction.</p>

At the auction, the Units sold at a price equivalent to the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the foreclosure sale. Primestone admits that the Units were the economic equivalent of PGE shares. Their value, therefore, should be considered roughly equivalent to the PGE share price on that day.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_43" id="ref_footnote_1_43">43</a> In fact, there can be little doubt that the Units’ value was less than <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>the value of PGE’s publicly traded shares. Although the Units were the economic equivalent of PGE shares, they lacked significant voting rights. The Units only represented limited partnership interests and could not participate in the management of the partnership.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_44" id="ref_footnote_1_44">44</a> PGE was still the General Partner of PGRLP.

There is no indication of any plans to liquidate PGRLP’s assets or that the real estate in PGRLP’s portfolio is easily liquidated.

This was allegedly done by Vornado’s indication that it would continue to negotiate an equity investment with PGE or the Private Prime Parties. This argument fails as a matter of law, however, because Section 17(h) of the Vornado Loan Agreement contained an integration clause that provided that the Agreement “supersede^] all prior agreements and understanding, both written <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>and oral, among the parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_70" id="ref_footnote_1_70">70</a> Thus, any alleged promise by Vornado that predated and related to the Vornado Loan Agreement is not actionable. In addition, Primestone has released any possible claims against Vornado. This is due to the October 8, 2001 letter, wherein Vornado consented to the extension of the Prudential Loan and received a release of liability in return for such consent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_71" id="ref_footnote_1_71">71</a> Finally, mere statements of future intent (as is the case here), without more, are not sufficient to establish fraud.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_72" id="ref_footnote_1_72">72</a> For all these reasons, the court will dismiss Count III of Prime-stone’s amended counterclaim.</p>

However, this appointment amounts to no more than a power coupled with an interest. A power coupled with an interest is a power that “is held for the benefit of a person other than the power giver.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_77" id="ref_footnote_1_77">77</a> Because this power was not held for the benefit of the debtor, no fiduciary relationship results from its grant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_78" id="ref_footnote_1_78">78</a> This provision was intended solely to protect Vornado’s interest in the collateral.</p>

Furthermore, Primestone admits that neither the “no shop” nor the “first offer” provision actually prevented Primestone from refinancing. Vornado simply did not exert enough control over Primestone’s business, assets, and finances to demonstrate that this court should impose fiduciary obligations on Vor-nado in this instance.

With the exception of the SSAs (which are explicitly governed by Illinois law), New York law applies to all of Vornado’s claims and all of Primestone’s counterclaims. The contract claims related to the Prudential Loan are subject to New York law because Primestone agreed that New York law would apply in Section 9.11 of the Prudential Loan Agreement. All the other claims are also subject to New York law because the parties chose New York law to govern certain contracts, the collateral was located in New York, and New York was the situs of most of the alleged acts on which Primestone’s claims are based. Accordingly, New York is the state with the most significant relationship to these claims and counterclaims. <em>See, e.g., IM2 Merchandising &amp; Mfg., Inc. v.
