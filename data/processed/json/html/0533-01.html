On May 4, 2000, Appellant filed several pleadings before the court, including a Motion for Post-Trial Relief, a Petition for Rule to Show Cause for Reconsideration of the Court’s April 27, 2000 Contempt Order and a Petition for Rule to Show Cause Why Court Order of April 27, 2000 Should Not Be Stayed Pending Consideration of Motion for Reconsideration. On May 15, 2000, the court ordered the filing of a 1925(b) statement of matters complained of on appeal. In a letter dated May 17, 2000, the trial court informed the parties: “You may disregard the request for a 1925b statement since the matter before the Court involves post-trial motions.” The letter also established a briefing schedule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On May 19, 2000, the trial court entered a Rule to Show Cause Why this Court’s Order Entered on April 27, 2000 Should Not be Stayed and Vacated.

This argument is correct. However, Appellant clearly, although erroneously, believed the order was subject to post-trial motions pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 227.1. This belief is evidenced by Appellant’s filing, within 10 days of the entry of the order, a Motion for Posh-Trial Relief. The trial court accepted and fostered this incorrect procedure, as evidenced by its May 17, 2000 letter revoking its earlier order for a 1925(b) statement and its entry of the May 19, 2000 Rule which was returnable outside of the 30-day appeal period.</p>

The petition for reconsideration could only have stayed the appeal period if the trial court expressly granted reconsideration pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1701(b)(3).

In reversing the finding of liability, the Supreme Court denounced the use of the doctrines of <em>re-spondeat superior </em>and vicarious liability in situations covered by the Act.

In <em>Schnabel, </em>the union was enjoined from misconduct at its picket fine. Following the entry of the injunction, however, several union members committed acts of violence on the picket line. The offending union members and the union were found in civil contempt of the injunction. On appeal, this Court found the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of civil contempt. The <em>Schnabel </em>court measured the evidence in the following manner:</p>

Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Helpers &amp; Taxicab Drivers, Local No. 327, </em><a href="/f2d/592/0921-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="592 F.2d 921" data-case-ids="53184" data-case-paths="/f2d/592/0921-01">592 F.2d 921</a> (6th Cir.1979). In that case, the circuit court upheld the Master’s finding that the union was in civil contempt of prior orders prohibiting mass picketing, blocking entrances to <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the employer’s business premises, and threatening harm to employees and property. The court ruled that (1) lack of effective action by the union, in the face of flagrant violations by union members, to repudiate the misconduct amounted to silent approbation and acquiescence in such activities, and (2) the union’s tacit approval of the members’ acts of violence during the labor disputes rendered the union responsible for its members’ misconduct.</blockquote>

Appellant did take action to investigate and control the misconduct that had occurred on its picket line. First, they stipulated to the injunction at issue, thus acknowledging the problem and aiding the court in proposing a solution, including a $20,000 fine to be imposed on Appellant in the event of further misconduct on its part. Further, pursuant to the terms of the stipulated injunction, Appellant placed a union agent on the picket line to be responsible for maintaining order. Although this agent was the individual who committed the assault at issue here, it would be difficult to say, after evaluating Appellant’s actions, that it tacitly approved of acts of violence by any member or that it took no action to curb the misconduct.</p>
