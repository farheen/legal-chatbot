We agree with Hood’s contention that the District Court erred in computing damages. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>

Mercier’s injuries consisted mainly of two broken thumbs, one of which was put in a cast and the other in a splint for 6-8 weeks. Mercier, a manual laborer, was unemployed at the time of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b635-14" data-blocks='[["BL_635.15",635,[980,347,755,945]]]'>Mercier had persistently attempted for 3 years to get a job as a merchandiser operator in the Forest Resource Division of Georgia-Pacific. A beginning, or Class C, merchandiser operator performs strenuous manual labor including using a chain saw to cut logs, doing utility work, and cleaning and greasing equipment. In late June 1979 Merle Fitzsimmons, personnel manager of the Forest Resource Division, notified Mer-cier that a position was available and offered him a job. Because his thumbs were still immobilized from the collision with Hood, Mercier was unable to accept the offer, and Fitzsimmons gave the job to someone else. Mercier persistently continued to seek employment with the Forest Resource Division. Finally, in mid-July 1980 Georgia-Pacific made Mercier a second offer, and he promptly took the job.</p>

Fitzsimmons testified that had Mercier been able to start work as a Class C merchandiser operator in late June 1979, he would have started at $6.63 per hour. Then Mercier would have received after 30 days an automatic increase to $7.03 per hour. Fitzsimmons further testified that in the normal course of events Mercier would have graduated to Class A merchandiser operator by the beginning of October to a rate of $8.18 per hour. Over Hood’s objection, Fitzsimmons testified to his calculation that between June 1979 when he first offered Mercier a job and July 1980 when Mercier finally came to work, Mercier would have made about $20,300 in straight time. Fitzsim-mons also testified that most crews at the time were averaging an additional 20% in overtime.</p>

The court thus found that but for the accident Mercier would have earned $24,360 working for Georgia-Pacific. Hood appeals arguing that the award of damages for lost wages is not supported by the evidence and that the court therefore erred in adopting Fitzsimmons’ calculations as to what Mercier would have made during the 54-week period between the end of June 1979 and mid-July 1980.</p>

The uncontradicted testimony was that, at the beginning of July 1979, Mercier would have made $6.63 per hour for four weeks, grossing $1,060.80. Then, from the beginning of August to the end of September, Mercier would have made $7.03 per hour for eight weeks, grossing $2,249.60. From the beginning of October to mid-July 1980, Mercier would have made $8.18 per hour, for 42 weeks, grossing $13,742.40. This totals $17,052.80. If overtime of 20%, as Fitzsim-mons indicated was the average, is included, the total comes to $20,463.36, $3,896.64 less than the $24,360 calculated by the District Court.
