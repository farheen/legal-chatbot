William Sr. and Rose had six natural children — Zita, Genevieve, Geraldine, Francis, Joseph and Margaret. According to Genevieve, in 1921, when she was 17 years old, her 21-year-old sister Zita brought home an out-of-wedlock son. To avoid the stigma that they feared would attach to a child born out of wedlock, Zita’s parents raised the infant as their own, calling him William J. Bahl (“William Jr.”). William Sr. and Rose never formally adopted William Jr., but his baptismal and school records indicated that he was their child and obituaries that were published when various members of the family died listed him as a sibling of Zita, Genevieve, Geraldine, Francis, Joseph and Margaret. In addition, Rose wrote letters to William Jr., which she signed either “mom” or “mother,” and likewise, Rose’s natural children wrote letters to William Jr. in which they simply referred to Rose as “mom.” <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>When William Sr. passed away in 1945, title to the family farm vested in Rose as his surviving wife. In 1969, Rose died and the farm’s title passed to her surviving children and grandchildren by intestate succession. Almost two decades later, in 1991, Appellant Lambert Farms, Inc. purchased the farm. As three of Rose’s six natural children (Francis, Joseph and Margaret) had passed away by that time, the deed listed the grantors of title as her three surviving natural children (Zita, Genevieve, and Geraldine), Geraldine’s husband, Joseph’s son (Joseph, Jr.), Margaret’s two daughters (Rosemary and Patricia) and their husbands.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Neither William Jr., who had passed away in 1980, nor any of his heirs were listed on the deed as grantors of title.</p>

Jennings, Catherine Horton, and Theresa Bacon, who are William Jr.’s heirs, brought the instant action to partition the farm, alleging that one-sixth of the farm was rightfully theirs. Essentially, the heirs contended that William Jr. was the last-born son of William Sr. and Rose and thus, he had inherited one-sixth of the farm by intestate succession. As the heirs had subsequently inherited their father’s property, which they maintain included his one-sixth share of the farm, and had not granted title to their share of the farm to Lambert Farms in the 1991 deed, they contended that Lambert Farms had not purchased their one-sixth share and that their one-sixth portion of the land should now be partitioned for their benefit.</p>

On February 21, 2000, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Lambert Farms and against William Jr.’s heirs. The heirs filed post-trial motions, which the trial court denied in an April 26, 2000 order and opinion. The trial court found, based on the evidence submitted, that the heirs had failed to sustain their burden of proving that William Jr. was the natural child of William Sr. and Rose. Instead, the court credited the testimony of Genevieve that William Jr. was the out-of-wedlock child of Zita and that William Sr. and Rose had merely raised William Jr. as their son to avoid the condemnation of the community, which the court noted “would have inevitably occurred in the 1920’s.” Trial Ct. Op. at 2. Although the court recognized that William Sr. and Rose had held William Jr. out to the public as their son and that Zita had listed William Jr.’s heirs as her nieces and nephews in her will, it concluded that “[t]o be one’s child for the purpose of inheritance, the putative parent must have contributed one-half of the genetic material comprising the subject’s 23 pairs of chromosomes, or the putative parent must have adopted the subject in some recognized legal proceeding.” Trial Ct. Op. at 2. As there was no evidence in the record that William Sr. and Rose had ever formally adopted William Jr., the court refused to recognize the claim of William Jr.’s heirs to Rose’s former property and therefore entered a verdict in favor of Lambert Farms.</p>

Initially, both parents were named as co-administrators, but the mother petitioned the court to remove the father, contending that he was not, in fact, the deceased’s natural father. In concluding that the mother was es-topped from challenging the father’s paternity under these circumstances, the Superior Court relied on 20 Pa.C.S. § 2107, which was enacted in 1978.

It therefore concluded that the decedent should be considered the father’s child for purposes of descent. In the alternative, the court stated that under the principle of equitable estoppel, the mother, who had held out her child as the father’s daughter for twenty-one years, was barred from denying the father’s paternity for the sole purpose of “elimi-nat[ing] [him] from receiving a share of [the child’s] estate.” <a href="/a2d/644/0791-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="644 A.2d 791" data-case-ids="7874839,943130" data-case-paths="/a2d/644/0791-01,/pa-super/434/0641-01">644 A.2d at 798</a>.

On March 15, 1969, Margaret filed a Petition for Letters of Administration with the Register of Wills for Sullivan County, in which she wrote that the next of kin of Rose were herself, Geraldine, Zita, Genevieve, Joseph, and William Jr. Reproduced Record (R.R.) 72a. In an attached Schedule of Proposed Distribution, Margaret proposed that she, Geraldine, Zita, Genevieve, Joseph, and William Jr., whom she listed as a son of Rose, divide the estate of Rose into equal shares. R.R. 74a. On August 23, 1988, Geraldine and Joseph filed another Petition for Grant of Letters of Administration, in which they listed themselves, Zita, and Genevieve as children of Rose, and the children of Margaret and the children of William Jr. as grandchildren of Rose. R.R. 75a-76a. By that time, both Margaret and William Jr. were deceased. On April 28, 1990, Geraldine sent a letter to Lambert Farms indicating that the estate of Rose was divided into six shares: (1) Zita; (2) Genevieve; (3) the children of Margaret; (4) the son of Joseph, who died in 1989; (5) Geraldine; and (6) the children of William Jr. (R.R. 82a). By letter dated May 17, 1990, the attorney for Geraldine wrote the following to Geraldine:</p>

    <p id="b586-12" data-blocks='[["BL_586.14",586,[995,1118,755,1176]],["BL_587.1",587,[139,264,757,189]]]'>Section 3521 of the Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. § 3521, provides in relevant part that a party in interest who wishes to challenge a decree of distribution from an intestate estate should do so within five years of that decree. While the record does not disclose the exact date of the decree of distribution, the evidence suggests that a decree was entered by the court on January 8, 1970. <em>See </em>R.R. 79a (letter to William Jr. informing him of an audit to be conducted by the Orphans’ Court of Sullivan County on that date; no party challenged the proposed distribution at that time). The distribution of the estate to include William Jr. as a child of Rose was re-confirmed in 1988, when Geraldine and Joseph filed a second Petition for Grant of Letters of Administration. By 1975, Zita, Genevieve, Joseph, Geraldine, or Margaret (if still alive) should have contested the status of William Jr. as a beneficiary of their mother’s <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>estate, but they did not. At least until May 17, 1990, they acted as if William Jr. were a child of Rose for the purposes of her estate.</p>
    <p id="b587-5" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[139,507,759,1189]]]'>The majority rejects the Section 8521 argument, concluding that the heirs of William Jr. did not preserve it and, therefore, waived it. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 541, n. 11. While the majority is correct in noting that the heirs of William Jr. never specifically mentioned Section 3521, a review of the Record demonstrates that the heirs of William Jr. continually pointed to documentation post-dating the death of Rose, indicating that William Jr. was an heir of the intestate estate of Rose. The heirs of William Jr. presented to the trial court and the Superior Court, <em>inter alia, </em>an estoppel argument, contending that the actions of the remainder of the family after the death of Rose served to estop them from denying the status of William Jr. as an intestate heir of Rose at the time of her death. I believe that the Section 3521 argument is fairly comprised therein and, accordingly, would hold that the heirs of William Jr. are entitled to one-sixth of the farm.</p>
    <p id="b587-6" data-blocks='[["BL_587.5",587,[138,1749,760,927]],["BL_587.6",587,[942,264,754,510]]]'>Based on the letter dated April 28, 1990, Lambert Farms had actual notice of the claim of the heirs of William Jr., and at some point in time between that date and the date of sale on April 11,1991, Lambert Farms and the other heirs of Rose agreed to the sale without the approval or knowledge of the heirs of William Jr. We do not know why on May 17, 1990, the heirs of William Jr. were parties to the proceedings, but less than eleven months later were no longer involved at the time of sale. We can only speculate that the other heirs of Rose could not convince the heirs of William Jr. to agree to the transaction. We do know, however, that nothing occurred between May 17, 1990 and April 11, 1991, which would have given the other heirs of Rose cause to challenge the status of the heirs of William Jr. By Genevieve’s own admission, the children of William Sr. and Rose knew that William Jr. was the child of Zita, not the child of Rose, at the time of the birth of William Jr. in 1921. To allow Genevieve (and the other heirs) to challenge the status of William Jr. in 1990 or 1991, more than twenty years after the death of Rose, strains credulity.</p>
    <p id="b587-8" data-blocks='[["BL_587.7",587,[942,820,757,1445]]]'>The majority permits the other heirs of Rose to eliminate William Jr. from their ranks after holding him out as a direct intestate heir for more than twenty years. This position I simply cannot accept. If the other heirs wished to assert the alleged truth about the biological lineage of William Jr., they should not have twice included him in the letters of administration of the estate of Rose. Alternatively, they could have challenged the distribution as late as January 8, 1975. Because they faded to claim that William Jr. was not a child of Rose within this time period, the other heirs of Rose were estopped from entering into a contract with any entity to sell the entire farm without the approval of William Jr. or his heirs. Therefore, the other heirs only had authority to sell five-sixths of the family farm to Lambert Farms and the heirs of William Jr. retain a one-sixth interest in the property. Because the other heirs of Rose failed to challenge the status of William Jr. as an intestate beneficiary within five years of the decree of distribution of Rose’s estate, they are estopped from doing so now and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>
