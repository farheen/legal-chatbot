Following several hearings, the referee found that Claimant suffered from sinus tarsi syndrome of the right foot due to a work-related injury that occurred on October 10, 1984. The referee concluded that her claim for “weekly compensation benefits” was barred by the three-year limitation set forth in Section 315 of the Act, and that this period of limitation had not been tolled by her receipt of non-work-related disability payments from April 21,1987 to June 21, 1987.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, the referee went on to conclude that Section 315 did not preclude her claim for medical expenses.

More than three years after executing a final receipt, the claimant filed a claim petition for further medical expenses, which was treated as a petition to set aside the final receipt. The Commonwealth Court held that the three-year limitation in section 434 did not apply to the claim for further medical expenses, because it interpreted “liberalizing” amendments to the Act to contemplate that a claimant could recover medical expenses even if he no longer was suffering a loss in earning power.</p>

It is only logical to interpret section 315, the section <em>extinguishing </em>the employer’s liability, as being parallel to the section <em>establishing </em>the employer’s liability, and therefore also to include medical expenses as an item of “compensation.” This conclusion is supported by the fact that the sections are contained in the same article of the Act and are both found in Chapter 5, “Liability and Compensation.” <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1924 (headings prefixed to articles, chapters, etc. of a statute may aid in construction) and § 1932 (statutes or parts of statutes in pari materia are to be construed together). As the <em>Bellefonte </em>court pointed out, “If the legislature intended to exclude medical benefits from ‘compensation’ in section 315, it would have expressly stated so.” <a href="/pa-commw/156/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="156 Pa.

While our interpretation of the statute of repose may seem strict in the sense that it places a limit on the time in which an employee must pursue a claim for medical expenses, we must point out that the flip side of our interpretation, which was reached in <em>Paolis, </em>resulted in a rule that is perhaps more harsh. Under the <em>Paolis </em>rule, an employer’s payment of medical expenses does not toll the running of the limitations period as would its payment of other "compensation.” <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 602. The rule therefore would allow an employee to be lulled into a false sense of security while receiving payments of medical expenses, without providing the employee with the "window" of the tolling provision, thus taking away his claim for other compensation if not filed within three years after the injury. On the other hand, we do recognize that the <em>Paolis </em>rule has been praised as being “a sound rule with beneficial results.” <em>Dennis v. E.J. Lavino &amp; Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/203/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="203 Pa.

The <em>Dennis </em>court believed that <em>Paolis </em>encouraged employers to voluntarily pay employees' medical expenses because they would not be penalized by the tolling of the limitations period for doing so. While such considerations are not insignificant, they cannot overcome the plain reading of the statute, which requires the opposite result.</p>
