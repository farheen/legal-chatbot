Since 1972, the property has been designated as an RC-6 residential district<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> under the Philadelphia Zoning Code (Code), which is a special zoning district created for planned developments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In 1985, the Planning Commission recommended and City Council approved a planned residential development for the property with ten braidings containing 202 apartments for Hunters Pointe. Seeking to deviate from the 1985 Master Plan, Developer submitted to the Executive Director a request for modification to construct six buildings containing 204 apartments which required an increase in gross total floor area of 2,400 feet and moving several buildings to the plateau area of the land.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Believing that this lengthy process was not required for every minor deviation from a master plan, beginning in the early 1980s, the Executive Director began to interpret Section 14-226(2)(b) to permit the staff of the Planning Commission to determine if deviations from a master plan qualified as “minor modifications” under a policy entitled “Criteria for Staff Approval of Master Plan Modification.” Under this policy, “minor modifications” were interpreted as alterations which decreased or did not increase by more than <em>1% </em>the amounts of gross floor area, building coverage, impervious coverage, number of dwelling units and modifications resulting in a lessened environmental impact as compared to the master plan previously approved by both <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>the Planning Commission and City Council. When a deviation was found to be a “minor modification,” the Executive Director would approve the modifications without Planning Commission or City Council involvement and then notify the developer of this approval. Finding that Developer’s proposed changes to the 1985 master plan qualified as a “minor modification,” the Executive Director followed this procedure and approved the proposed changes. Having received approval for his changes, Developer then filed an application with the City of Philadelphia Department of Licensing &amp; Inspections (L &amp; I) for a zoning and use registration permit for the Hunters Pointe development, which was granted.</p>

Planned developments are developments allowing mixed uses and flexibility from the requirements of the zoning code such as setbacks and yard requirements. <em>See </em>Pennsylvania Zoning Law and Practice, Ryan, § 12.1.1. However, the ability to deviate from the requirements of the zoning code is also accompanied by inflexibility because the specific design of the development must be formalized into a master plan requiring lengthy negotiations with municipal authorities which is often precipitated by public debate and city council approval. <em>Id. </em>Once approved, the master plan must be filed with the appropriate agency and any development of the area is confined to its terms.

Walter Gray Smith, an architect and urban planner, testified on behalf of Objectors as to how the proposed changes to the 1985 master plan did not meet the criteria to qualify as “minor modifications” under the Executive Director’s policy. Because of the way we have resolved this case, we need not address whether the modifications were minor ones under the criteria. We note that while it is not mentioned in the criteria in any way, the movement of buildings for any distance cannot be considered a "minor modification.” Planned residential zoning districts were created so that buildings could be "clustered” on a single large parcel rather than requiring a separate zoning lot for every building, and the placement of buildings on the parcel is one of the most important considerations in whether a plan is approved or not.</p>

She stated that the policy had been followed for 25 years without objection by the City Council which could have altered the Code to specify that "any changes” must go through the formalized process.</p>

Objectors also continue to maintain that the trial court erred in finding that the Zoning Board did not have jurisdiction over an appeal of L &amp; I’s issuance of a zoning and use permit to Developer because Section 14-1801(l)(a) and Section 14-1702(1) of the Code grant the Board broad jurisdiction over appeals from the "decisions” of L &amp; I. While ordinarily, the Code gives the Board broad jurisdiction, Section 14-226 of the Code carves out for different treatment matters involving planned residential developments by requiring the Planning Commission to make recommendations and City Council to approve such developments, and the appeal would then be directly to common pleas court. Once approval for a development plan is given by the City Council, ordinarily, L &amp; I has no discretion but to issue the permit. The situation here deviates from this practice, because what Objectors are contending is that the prescribed procedure requiring City Council approval has not been followed, and, in effect, that L &amp; I's action in granting the permit was improper because that approval had not been obtained. In the end, though, we agree with Developer that the issue became moot when the trial court decided to hear the matter <em>de novo, </em>especially when the controlling issue of whether the Executive Director had the power to approve minor modifications to a master plan is a legal one.</p>
