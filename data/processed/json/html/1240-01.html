On March 3, 1997, Deak requested and was granted sabbatical leave for the 1997-98 school year. The sabbatical was taken pursuant to several sources of authority: Sections 1166, 1166.1, and 1168 of the Public School Code of 1949 (School Code), Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, <em>as amended, </em>24 P.S. §§ 11-1166, 11-1166.1 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and 11-1168; Article 17 of the School District Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA); and the School District Policy No. 438. Pursuant to the CBA, Deak was paid 50% of her salary during the sabbatical, or $19,141. She also purportedly received benefits worth $7,613.65 during this time, in the form of social security, Medicare, retirement, medical insurance, life insurance, income protection, workers’ compensation, and other benefits.</p>

Prior to the sabbatical, Deak had a total of fifteen students, with no more than nine students in her classroom at one time. Following the sabbatical, she had a total of sixteen students (according to the trial court) or twenty students (according to Deak) with no more than nine students in the classroom at any one time. Part-time special education classrooms are purportedly for students who spend 50-85% of their time with the special education teacher, while students in resource rooms purportedly spend 50% or less of their time in a special education environment. Changes regarding the special education department at the middle school were purportedly being contemplated for a number of years, and Deak was purportedly privy to meetings and discussions concerning these changes both before and during her sabbatical. The trial court “found” that when she returned from sabbatical and received her classroom assignment, she did not believe <a id="p1242" href="#p1242" data-label="1242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1242</a>it to be a problem, although it was apparent that she was assigned only to seventh grade special education students. Trial Court Opinion, p. 5. In her deposition, however, Deak indicated that she was unaware that she was being assigned to a resource classroom and that she was unprepared for it. Deak Deposition, pp. 31-82.</p>
    <p id="b1284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1284.4",1284,[203,770,756,794]]]'>Deak believed that she was assigned a different position than the one she had prior to the sabbatical, one that apparently did not work out too well for her. She described the problem in her deposition as follows: “The minute school started and my students started arriving and I realized that there were too many of them and I was trying to work my program as a part-time program and there were so many students and it wasn’t working. It was very difficult.” <em>Id. </em>at 32. It purportedly became so difficult that Deak resigned her job with the School District effective January 7, 1999, less than a full school year after her sabbatical.</p>

The teacher, however, must be returned to the “same position” following the sabbatical for such liability to apply. <em>See Dinberg v. Oil City Area School District, </em>52 Pa.Cmwlth. 449, <a href="/citations/?q=416%20A.2d%201139" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="416 A.2d 1139">416 A.2d 1139</a> (1980). Deak was apparently aware of this condition and aware that the School District would pursue the matter. Following Deak’s resignation, the School District requested that Deak repay sums in the amount of $15,164.94. She refused, and the School District filed a complaint against her in the trial court. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment based upon the depositions and affidavits of Deak and the School District’s Director of Special Education. The trial court, in an opinion that appears to have “found” facts that were not agreed upon, dismissed Deak’s motion and granted that of the School District, concluding that Deak was returned to the “same position” for purposes of Section 1168. This appeal followed.</p>

The School District argues that Deak’s alleged differences are “irrelevant, exaggerated, and unsupported by the facts.” School District’s Brief, p. 12. It generally fleshes out this argument not by referencing any “facts” agreed upon by the two parties, but by arguing certain points from the two depositions and making references to exhibits introduced by the School District and attached to the depositions.

First several of the differences do appear to be inconsequential in accordance with <em>Dinberg, </em>namely the fact that Deak was assigned to teach only 7th graders when she previously taught 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> To paraphrase <em>Dinberg, </em>teaching 7th graders is the same as teaching 7th graders. On several of the other alleged differences, however, we are not prepared, based upon the existing record, to unhesitatingly determine that they are so insignificant that the School District is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Our hesitation is prompted in large part because we are involved here with the education of special education children, whose specific needs have led to the promulgation of two chapters of the Department of Education’s regulations. <em>See </em>22 Pa.Code Chapters 14 and 342. We cannot simply conclude that “teaching special education students is the same as teaching special education students” when there are, apparently, different teaching protocols involved and different degrees of student need and/or ability involved.</p>
    <p id="b1286-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1286.6",1286,[1011,620,754,1026]]]'>The “facts” of record do not sufficiently describe the practical import to a special education teacher of a part-time classroom as contrasted with a resource classroom<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>, the addition of five more special education students per year, or the significance to a teacher in Deak’s position of having to teach students on a 2nd to 12th grade level when she had been teaching those on a 2nd to 4th grade level. Indeed, the School District disputes Deak’s allegations that she was assigned a student or students with a 12th grade reading level, although they appear to admit that she was assigned a student or students with a 9th grade reading level. The School District also disputes Deak’s assertion that she was assigned up to 20 students in the new position, although one of their own exhibits appears to support this assertion.</p>

There are clearly outstanding issues of fact, and the record does not establish, with clarity and without doubt, that the School District is entitled at this stage to judgment as a matter of law. We make no determination regarding the alleged differences between Deak’s previous and new positions. The differences as a whole may indeed be of such a character that it should be determined that <a id="p1245" href="#p1245" data-label="1245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1245</a>Deak was returned to a different position for purposes of Section 11-1168 or, as the School District argues, they may indeed be “irrelevant, exaggerated, and unsupported by the facts.” This is a matter for a fact finder to determine following an appropriate hearing, as the parties clearly do not agree upon the pertinent facts and their import. Moreover, what constitutes the “factual” record in this case is essentially the deposition testimony of two witnesses whose testimony is subject to credibility determinations by the fact finder. Therefore, a sufficient basis for summary judgment had not been established. <em>Ack v.

Further, Section 1168(d) of the School Code provides for the School District’s recouping of pension contributions.
