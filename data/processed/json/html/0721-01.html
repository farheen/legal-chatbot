Perry (Perry), as well as a decree requiring him to pay $85.00 per week for child support. Some seventeen months later, on February 6, 1976, she moved pursuant to Rule 80(j) M.R.Civ.P. that Perry be adjudicated in contempt for having failed to meet his court-ordered obligation of child support. He countered by filing a cross motion in which, though acknowledging that he had failed to comply with the outstanding decree in that he had been paying only $50.00 per week plus some “other expenses”, he alleged change of material circumstances as the basis for alteration of the outstanding decree to establish an apportionment of the obligation for child support between both parents. Perry sought such alteration not only to affect his obligation for future payments but also to operate retrospectively to excuse entirely, or reduce, his liability for accumulated arrearages. On October 28, 1977 the District Court, apparently overlooking the cross motion filed by Perry, ruled only on Mrs. Gardner’s motion for enforcement of the outstanding decree. It granted that motion, adjudicated Perry in contempt and ordered him to pay $4,115.00, the amount found due and unpaid under the outstanding decree.</p>

On November 20, 1978 the District Court denied Perry’s cross motion, acting on the basis of testimony that had been recorded at the time of the original hearings on the motions. Perry appealed this determination to the Superior Court which denied Perry’s appeal, and he then sought, and obtained, from this Court an Order consolidating the appeal he was taking from the Superior Court’s affirmance of the District Court’s denial of his cross motion with his already pending appeal from the judgment against him for accumulated arrearages.</p>

The questions and comments of the District Court Judge reflect a fundamental concern that Perry had not met his obligation for child support in accordance with the requirements of the decree. The Judge sought a justification for Perry’s unilateral decision to reduce his obligation by means of the type of purchases ordinarily considered outside the scope of the obligation, such as new shoes at the start of the school year. When the Judge had apparently satisfied himself that no showing of necessity was forthcoming, such as a demonstration that his former wife had refused to make the purchases required to replace worn-out footwear, the Judge ruled the proffered list of expenditures inadmissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

While <em>Wilson </em>declares that a court has <em>power </em>to alter a decree, even retroactively, to comport with new conditions, it nowhere suggests that a refusal to exercise this extraordinary power, grounded in a court’s unwillingness to take into account the circumstances surrounding each and every expenditure claimed as a substitute for court-ordered payments of support, constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>

Only when such justification was not forthcoming did the Judge refuse to give consideration to the “in-kind” disbursements. He did not rule them generally inadmissible, as a matter of law, regardless of circumstances. Rather, his ruling was properly regarded by the Superior Court as being an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances obtaining in this particular instance. So regarded, the District Court’s ruling should stand if it is not an abuse of judicial discretion. <em>Cf., Gulesian v. Gulesian, </em>Me., <a href="/a2d/377/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="377 A.2d 119" data-case-ids="7979603" data-case-paths="/a2d/377/0119-01">377 A.2d 119</a> (1977) (separate support pending divorce); <em>Roussel v.

Perry wanted the Court to take account of these circumstances to order: (1) retroactive alteration of the outstanding decree for child support, thereby to excuse entirely, or reduce, Perry’s liability for accumulated arrearages; and (2) alteration of the decree to allocate to each of the parents the amounts to be paid in the future.</p>
