A detachable rib-back surgical blade made by first rolling a thin flexible strip of steel to produce therein symmetrical longitudinal ribs, then forming curved perforations in the strip partially outlining oppositely arranged blanks with the back of each blank including a straight part of one of the previously formed longitudinal ribs, hardening and tempering the perforated strip, then separating the blanks from the strip each with an edge portion partially curved and partially straight, and grinding said edge portions to form a continuous cutting edge, the body of the blade being sheet metal of uniform thickness and of an order of .015 inches in thickness and of compact structure and having a sharpened portion lying opposite to said rib and an aperature in its body so located as to set off an end portion of the blade for torsional flexing about said rib as a relatively stiff axis.</blockquote>

When such a rib is used, the hand or finger of the surgeon can be readily pressed against the flat top surface without injuring the hand or the glove. * * * Wherever a rib is used, it tends to reinforce portions adjacent to it.

A detachable blade for surgical knives, having a sheet steel body of substantially uniform thickness, sharpened at one edge for cutting and having its opposite edge thickened to form a solid longitudinal rib supplying a flat pressure-receiving face wider than the body of the blade for the finger of the user and tending to stiffen the blade against lateral flexing in use, the blade having an attaching recess spaced from said, rib and serving to render flexible in torsion a localized area in the blade whereby that area,may be readily flexed about the rib as an axis in attaching or detaching the blade while the blade as a whole is maintained against distortion to the same extent by said rib.</blockquote>
    <p id="b678-10" data-blocks='[["BL_678.11",678,[245,1831,1325,193]]]'>As hereinbefore noted, the decision of the board in that case was rendered July 31, 1935, and the application here involved was filed on that date. Ten method claims have been allowed appellants in the involved application.</p>

    <blockquote id="b678-12" data-blocks='[["BL_678.13",678,[246,2104,1324,279]]]'>The claim stands rejected on the ground that it is not a proper product claim, many process limitations being included which give no distinguishable characteristics to the finished article. It is the examiner’s view that, in so far as the process limitations included do serve to distinguish the article from the prior art, they are not patentable over art cited in connection with a former appeal by the same parties on a detachable surgical blade, which appeal was decided adversely to them.</blockquote>

This tends to indicate that the present <a id="p1361" href="#p1361" data-label="1361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1361</a>•case does not fall within the exception to the general rule that a product should not he defined by the process of making. It is conceivable that certain steps of the process, which are included in claim 47, could be detected in the final product such, for instance, as the fact that the blade is made from longitudinally rolled stock and that the rib is formed by a rolling operation. We do not feel, however, that it could be determined from an inspection of the finished blade that it had been shaped by perforating the strip stock previous to a tempering operation. We also doubt if it would be possible to determine whether the blade had been formed along one side of a strip which originally ■carried similar blades at the opposite side.</blockquote>
