To test speech discrimination, the patient is placed in a soundproof booth, which is an acoustically ideal environment, and a standardized word list is presented to each ear individually.

The word list is presented at a standardized decibel level, which is generally 40 decibels above the patient’s speech reception threshold <em>(see </em>footnote 4, <em>infra </em>) or the patient’s most comfortable level of hearing.

To determine a patient's speech reception threshold (SRT), the patient is placed in a soundproof booth, and a standardized word list is presented to each ear individually. Dr. Fro-man's Dep. at 15. The word list is different than the type of word list that is used in the speech discrimination test. <em>Id. </em>at 17. The degree of loudness or decibel level at which the patient can accurately repeat fifty percent of the words is the patient's SRT. Dr. Froman’s Dep. at 15-16; Dr. Kamerer’s Dep. at 9. Normal SRTs range from zero to approximately 20 to 25 decibels. Dr. Froman’s Dep. at 16; Dr. Kamerer’s Dep. at 9.</p>

While we give full respect to and acknowledge that this court is bound by our Supreme Court’s holding in <em>Hartlieb, </em>which further defined the term "complete loss of hearing” as used in Section 306(c)(8) of the Act, we also are cognizant that technology in hearing science has advanced significantly since 1975 when <em>Hartlieb </em>was decided. Because clinical testing in certain areas is a more precise and accurate means of measuring hearing loss than it was twenty years ago, objective test results may represent a more trustworthy method of measuring hearing loss than a claimant’s own testimony that he cannot hear. Therefore, we i espectfully suggest that the legislature re-examine the Act’s provisions dealing with occupational hearing loss in recognition of the advancements that have been made in hearing science and the development of medical tests that provide reliable, objective results.</p>

We note that Dr. Kamerer, in rendering his opinion, also indicated that he computed the degree of Claimant’s hearing impairment according to a formula of the American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery (AAO). Based on that formula, he calculated that Claimant has a zero percent impairment. The referee, however, specifically rejected Dr. Kamerer’s conclusion that Claimant’s hearing impairment is zero percent. Referee's Finding of Fact No. 13.</p>
