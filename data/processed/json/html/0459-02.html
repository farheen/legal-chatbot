Dufalla (seller) and against Widmer Engineering, Inc., (buyer) following verdict in a non-jury trial on competing breach of contract claims arising from the sale of an engineering firm, Engelhardt-Power and Associates, Inc. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>

      <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>¶ 2 The relevant facts, as gleaned from the record, show that Dufalla, a civil engineer, had been the sole shareholder of Engelhardt, a closely held corporation providing engineering, design and surveying services for public and private construction projects. In 1993, Dufalla was appointed by Governor Robert Casey to the post of District Engineer for the State Department of Transportation. In order to avoid any potential appearance of conflict of interest, Dufalla decided to sell his engineering firm and initially approached Harvey Tresehow, its corporate manager, about any possible interest he might have in purchasing it. Although Tresehow was interested, negotiations stalled and Dufalla sought other potential buyers while Tres-chow continued on in his position as corporate manager.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[213,1349,756,1140]]]'>¶ 3 On February 28, 1995, Dufalla entered into an agreement to sell Engelhardt to Widmer Engineering. Closing was held that date. The agreement of sale provided that “[a]t closing, Corporation, through its officers, will issue a termination notice to Corporation’s present manager.” When Engelhardt became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Widmer the following day, March 1, 1995, Harvey Tresehow had not been terminated from employment by Du-falla or by any other officer of Engelhardt. Moreover, Engelhardt was staffed by persons who were not employees of Engel-hardt, but who were contract employees of Technical Personnel Services, Inc. (TPSI), a temporary employment agency. Harvey Tresehow, in addition to being Engel-hardt’s corporate manager, was the president and chief shareholder of TPSI, which had contracted with Engelhardt to provide Engelhardt with personnel.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[213,2531,752,136]]]'>¶4 Paragraph 7(h) of the sales agreement between Dufalla and Widmer provided that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[1061,268,712,549]]]'>The Corporation [Engelhardt] has not entered into, and is not subject to, any: (i) written contract or agreement for the employment of any employee of the business; (ii) contract with any labor union or guild; (iii) pension, profit-sharing, retirement, bonus, insurance, or similar plan with respect to any employee of the business; or (iv) similar contract or agreement affecting or relating to the corporation.</blockquote>
    <p id="b502-7" data-blocks='[["BL_502.7",502,[1016,842,755,1316]]]'>¶ 5 The contracts between Engelhardt and TPSI and between TPSI and its employees had not been disclosed by seller to buyer and buyer did not discover the existence of those contracts during its due diligence period. When it learned of the contracts, buyer sought to hire TPSI’s employees as its own. Tresehow demanded, as per TPSI’s contract with Engelhardt, that Engelhardt reimburse TPSI in an amount equal to 20% of each individual TPSI employee’s annual salary in order to “buy out” the employment contracts. En-gelhardt/Widmer declined to pay. TPSI subsequently filed suit against seller and Engelhardt. The suit eventually settled for $8000. Buyer spent $22,486.35 in attorneys’ fees defending the action and contributed $3000 to the settlement amount. When buyer later sued seller for breach of the sales agreement, it claimed, among other things, entitlement to $25,486.35 in damages to cover its attorneys’ fees and settlement contribution in the TPSI suit under the following indemnification provision contained in the agreement:</p>

      <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>¶ 6 Buyer’s suit against seller also alleged that seller materially breached the sales agreement by failing to pay <em>% </em>of Engelhardt’s corporate taxes, a requirement which was set forth among others in the following provision of the sales agreement:</p>
    <blockquote id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[127,624,715,1575]],["BL_503.5",503,[925,259,717,845]]]'>4. <em>Adjustments to Purchase Price. </em>If the face amount of the Accounts Receivable and Payroll Account on the closing date shall be greater or less than $100,000.00, then the amount to be paid pursuant to Article 3 above [Purchase Price] shall be increased or decreased as the case may be, by the amount by which the face total amount of the Accounts Receivable and Payroll account is greater than or less than $100,000.00. These amounts do not include any reserve for taxes set aside as required under Article 7(1) hereof. After the closing, Seller shall transfer and deliver to Purchaser all cash and other property which Seller may receive relating to the Accounts Receivable after the closing date. All receivables not collected within one year of closing will be deducted from any amount due Seller by Purchaser. Any receivables not collected within one year will be assigned by Purchaser to Seller. Any liabilities of the Corporation, to the extent that such liabilities in the aggregate exceed the lien on the building where the corporation’s offices are located, and which is estimated to be approximately $60,000.00 will be deducted from the payment due to Seller under Article 3 hereof. In addition, Seller will pay to Purchaser an amount equal to two-thirds (%) of the corporate income taxes which would be due from the corporation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1994 and ending July 30, 1995, without the application of the existing carry forward credit. Also, Seller will pay to Purchaser the amouhnt [sic] of any checks issued prior to closing in payment of the T1010 Theomat and presented for payment after closing. Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any bills bpaid [sic] by Seller prior to closing but applicable to the period after closing. The aforesaid adjustments will be made by the parties on March 15, 1996.</blockquote>

On the date of closing, seller, who was seeking approximately $600,000 in value in return for all his shares of the corporation, received cash in the amount of $181,500. Sixty thousand dollars of that amount was via check from buyer to seller. Seller additionally received $121,500, directly out of Engelhardt’s operating funds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As will be discussed in greater detail below, seller also received title to the building which housed Engelhardt,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and buyer promised that it would pay seller at least $120,000 plus 7.5% interest over a period of fifteen years for seller’s covenant not to compete. Moreover, the parties agreed that adjustments to the purchase price would be computed one year after closing based upon <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>the amount of accounts receivable collected during that time.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[218,382,758,763]]]'>¶ 8 During negotiations for the sale of the business, buyer decided that it was not interested in acquiring the building which Engelhardt owned and out of which it operated. Thus, the agreement of sale provided that upon closing, the corporation would tender a deed for the property to seller, who would then lease the building back to buyer in exchange for fixed rent of $1000 per month. The lease agreement was incorporated into and made part of the agreement of sale. Realizing that the transfer of the real estate would result in a capital gain for the corporation, the parties agreed, as per the lease agreement, that:</p>
    <blockquote id="Ann" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[254,1162,716,871]]]'>Lessor [Dufalla] shall grant to lessee [Widmer] a credit in the amount of one half of the accrued corporate income taxes on the capital gain reportable because of the sale of real estate from the Corporation to Seller. This credit shall be applied to Rent payments due, beginning with the payment due March 1, 1995, until the credit is exhausted. For the purposes of this paragraph, the corporate income taxes referred to herein shall be 15% of the first $50,000.00, 25% of the next $25,000.00, and 34% of the next $25,000.00, of the amount by which the sum exceeds the depreciated basis of the building and land as shown on the corporation’s books.</blockquote>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[212,2059,757,455]]]'>¶ 9 A covenant not to compete was also included in the agreement of sale which provided that, in exchange for seller’s promise not to compete with buyer within Washington County for a period of five years, buyer would reimburse seller a minimum of $120,000 and up to a maximum of $270,000. The agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[251,2531,714,143]],["BL_504.8",504,[1055,265,720,1584]]]'>...

Payment for the covenant not to compete shall be made over a fifteen year period with the first payment due thirty days after closing.

    <p id="b504-8" data-blocks='[["BL_504.9",504,[1013,1893,753,781]]]'>¶ 10 Despite the agreement’s provision that seller was to pay <em>% </em>of the corporate income taxes, he did not do so, and a penalty with interest was assessed to the corporation by the IRS which was paid by buyer, which also paid 100% of the corporate taxes. In March of 1996, the parties and their lawyers met for the apparent purpose of fixing the adjustments to the purchase price. Buyer presented seller with a tabulation of accounts receivable which had been collected and demanded payment from seller, per the agreement, for the difference between that amount and $100,000. Seller refused to pay.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.3",505,[104,264,754,1591]]]'>
      <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>¶ 11 Seller’s contention at the meeting was that he had not been given sufficient or accurate figures for the amount of accounts receivable which had been collected subsequent to closing. Moreover, seller felt he was entitled to a credit for “un-billed” receivables, a type of account about which the agreement was silent, but which seller felt comprised “work in progress” at the time of the closing. Seller maintained that there were projects which had been started under his ownership but which had not been completed or billed until after ownership had been transferred. Seller maintained that although buyer received the full benefit of these “unbilled” receivables, there was no corresponding increment in the purchase price nor, alternatively, was credit given to seller in a corresponding amount as a set-off against purchase price adjustment payments for which he was responsible. Seller also maintained that he was being saddled with more than 100% of the corporate tax for the year in question by being required to pay 66% of it under the purchase price adjustment provision as well as being required to extend buyer a 50% credit toward the capital gains tax amount under the lease provision.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[107,1897,752,518]]]'>¶ 12 Buyer, on the other hand, considered seller’s refusal to pay any amount toward the corporate taxes to be a material breach of the agreement which would excuse buyer from tendering any further payment to seller. Thus, buyer stopped further payments on the covenant not to compete, which had, up until that time, been made in the amount of approximately $2400 per month.</p>
    <p id="b505-7" data-blocks='[["BL_505.7",505,[905,264,756,1184]]]'>¶ 18 Buyer then brought suit to recover, among other things, amounts it paid in corporate taxes and to defend the TPSI suit as well as amounts seller owed as a purchase price adjustment based on accounts receivable collected. Seller counter-claimed, seeking, among other things, full payment under the non-compete clause. Trial of the matter was conducted, non-jury, before the Honorable David L. Gilmore in Washington County on April 23-24, 2001. David Widmer, buyer’s president, testified that buyer’s damages resulting from seller’s breach of the agreement’s provisions totaled $220,673.73 in principal amount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Mr. Widmer further testified that he had calculated and added monthly interest at the rate of 7.5% onto the unpaid principal amount. He calculated that the interest owed on the principal was $90,257.28, and thus, claimed entitlement to a total damages award of $310,931.01.</p>

Central to the court’s resolution of the competing claims was its determination that while seller’s failure to pay two-thirds of the corporate taxes was a breach of the agreement, the breach was not material because buyer nonetheless retained the benefit of the bargain it reasonably expected, <em>ie., </em>the purchase of an engineering firm. Thus, the court held that buyer was not excused from remitting payments under the non-compete provisions but was responsible for the remainder of payments due to seller thereunder. Because incomplete figures were presented at trial with respect to how much the average annual billings exceeded $527,000, the court’s award to seller under the non-compete provision was limited to $120,000 plus interest.

Accordingly, we agree with seller that if any of the work contained on the Engelhardt billing list was subcontracted to another firm owned or operated by buyer, the corresponding billing should count toward the average annual billings total. On the other hand, we find that the agreement’s language would permit deduction of amounts from the gross annual billings which were subcontracted to firm(s) other than those owned or operated by buyer since those amounts would merely pass through En-gelhardt and be of little or no benefit to buyer. This interpretation of the provision at issue requires remand for a hearing to determine which portions of the subcontracted work, if any, were awarded by Engelhardt to entities also under the control of buyer.

Moreover, seller’s argument that the 50% credit he gave to buyer in rent set-offs indicates that capital gains taxes were intended to be a separate and distinct obligation for the parties to share equally is unavailing. The evidence showed that buyer was uncomfortable paying even <em>lh </em>of the corporate taxes knowing that the lion’s share of the amount due would be based on a capital gain which the corporation would not realize since it was, in fact, giving the property away.

Seller testified that, whatever their value, he left such accounts with En-gelhardt as part of the sale because the corporation’s cash accounts were essentially depleted at the time of transfer and he wanted buyer to have some liquidity available.
