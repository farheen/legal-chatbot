Here, one of the affidavits contains a sworn statement, made of the affiant’s own knowledge, that the average computer programmer is familiar with subroutines for running integration, addition, etc. If this statement is true, the examiner’s rejection is, of course, baseless. In the absence of a challenge to the affiant’s qualifications or, at the very least, a contrary inference by the board or examiner from the other evidence, we are unable to hold that this record supports the board’s affirmance.
