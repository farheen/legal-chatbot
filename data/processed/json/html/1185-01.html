Appellant was convicted by a jury of first-degree premeditated murder while armed, D.C.Code §§ 22-2402, -3202 (Repl.1989), kidnapping, <em>id. </em>§ 22-2101, robbery, <em>id. </em>§ 22-2901, unauthorized use of a vehicle, <em>id. </em>§ 22-3815, second-degree burglary, <em>id. </em>§ 22-1801(b), and second-degree theft, <em>id. </em>§ 22-3811, -3812(b). He appeals from his convictions on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence and improper prosecu-torial closing argument; he also contends that some of his convictions merge. In addition, he appeals from the denial of his motion for reduction of sentence on the grounds that the motions judge abused his discretion. We find these contentions unpersuasive.</p>

When Mr. Gluckman protested, Givens hit him over the head several times with a flashlight, causing Mr. Gluckman to lose consciousness for five to ten minutes. Hill and Givens then drove around the city, stopping briefly at Givens’ sister’s house (Irene Givens), and they later got high on PCP. When Givens<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> asked Hill if he wanted to burglarize Mr. Gluck-man’s home, and Hill said no, Givens said he was going to get appellant.

Hill and Givens, who were getting high on PCP and marijuana, began to drink liquor; appellant did not drink alcohol, although he did use drugs.</p>

Givens and appellant reemerged about half an hour later with three plastic garbage bags and a brown leather bag; appellant was carrying two of the plastic bags. The three men took the items to Irene Givens’ house and divided them up.

Bruce Chase, age 21 and a friend of all three defendants, testified that in January, 1984, while at Givens’ house, appellant showed him Mr. Gluck-man’s driver’s license and told him “that was the man they robbed.” According to Chase, appellant said, “[h]e dead, I know he dead.” Givens told appellant to be quiet. Sylvester Givens, age 23 and Dale Givens’ brother, testified that on January 8, 1984, while at his sister Irene Givens’ apartment, appellant told “[h]ow they killed the man,” without saying whether or not he was in the car at the time, but admitting he was in a parking lot where it happened and at some point had been in the back of the car. Sylvester Givens admitted that he had cashed the pennies that were in the jar taken from Mr. Gluckman’s home, and after having his memory refreshed with his grand jury testimony, Sylvester recalled that he had told the grand jury that appellant had said that the man had said, “don’t kill him, you know, let him go, he won’t tell anybody.” Givens’ sister Irene Givens, age 25, testified that appellant had told her that he had driven around with Dale Givens and Hill and was in the back seat and had seen something in the back seat, but he did not say what it was.</p>

The motions judge noted that appellant had appeared twice before Chief Judge Moul-trie — at arraignment on February 7, 1985, and at a status hearing on February 28, 1985 — but appellant does not contend, and the record does not show, that he raised any complaints about trial counsel. The motions judge concluded that the “[appellant’s] statements at the hearing on July 25, 1984, with nothing more, were not sufficient to trigger a <em>Monroe/Farrell </em>hearing.” While the motions judge was correct in part, he failed to take into account the fact that appellant had been cut off by the status judge before he had an opportunity to allege more.</p>

This contention is based on the handwritten notes of Detective Kilcullen taken during an interview with Dale Givens.

Actually, the prosecutor testified that, while he made no promises, he might have told Hill, that if there was a need, he would tell the court about Hill's cooperation at appellant’s trial. But, even so, Hill’s testimony was somewhat inconsistent on the matter, and in his affidavit recanting his trial testimony, Hill admitted that the prosecutor had made no promises to him.

Since this would presumably be the status judge’s last encounter with the case, the status judge might understandably believe that it would make sense for the Felony I judge, who would inherit the case, to make the decision as to appellant’s representation. As is likely in a crowded urban court, however, substantial time (seven months) passed before appellant's case came before the Felony I judge. Consequently, if appellant had a legitimate complaint about his counsel, he was entitled to have it promptly resolved, so that an effective attorney could begin at once to prepare appellant's defense. Also, no entry was made in the trial court case jacket to alert the Felony I judge to appellant’s expression of concern about trial counsel.</p>

But, the trial judge commented that the normal procedure was for the government to allow defense counsel to view a videotape in advance of trial so that the trial would not have to be delayed while defense counsel had an opportunity to view the videotape. Had this been done, trial counsel might have been better able to cross-examine Hill, because counsel would have had additional time to prepare. <em>Compare James, <a href="/a2d/580/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="177" data-cite="580 A.2d 636" data-case-ids="7370358" data-case-paths="/a2d/580/0636-01">supra </a></em><a href="/a2d/580/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="177" data-cite="580 A.2d 636" data-case-ids="7370358" data-case-paths="/a2d/580/0636-01">note 23</a>, 580 A.2d at 643 <em>with Frezzell, <a href="/a2d/380/1382-01" class="citation" data-index="178" data-cite="380 A.2d 1382" data-case-ids="8017547" data-case-paths="/a2d/380/1382-01">supra </a></em><a href="/a2d/380/1382-01" class="citation" data-index="178" data-cite="380 A.2d 1382" data-case-ids="8017547" data-case-paths="/a2d/380/1382-01">note 23</a>, <a href="/a2d/380/1382-01" class="citation" data-index="179" data-cite="380 A.2d 1382" data-case-ids="8017547" data-case-paths="/a2d/380/1382-01">380 A.2d at 1385</a>.</p>
