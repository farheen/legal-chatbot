What starts the period running <a id="p1818" href="#p1818" data-label="1818" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1818</a>is clearly the availability of the invention <em>to the public </em>through the categories of disclosure enumerated in 102(b), which include “a printed publication” anywhere describing the invention.  There appears to be no dispute about the operation of this statute in “complete anticipation” situations but <em>the contention seems to be that 102(b) has no applicability where the invention is not completely disclosed in a single patent or publication, </em>that is to say where the rejection involves the addition to the disclosure of the reference of the ordinary skill of the art or the disclosure of another reference which indicates what those of ordinary skill in the are are presumed to know, <em>and to have known for more than a year before the application was filed. </em>Upon a complete reexamination of this matter, we are convinced that the contention is contrary to the policy consideration which motivated the enactment by Congress of a statutory bar.

In considering this principle <em>we </em>assume, of course, that by these means <em>the invention has become obvious </em>to that segment of the “public” having ordinary skill in the art. Once this has happened, the purpose of the law is to give the inventor only a year within which to file and this would seem to be liberal treatment.  Whenever an applicant undertakes, under Rule 131, to swear back of a reference having an effective date more than a year before his filing date, he is automatically conceding that he made his invention more than a year before he filed. If the reference contains enough disclosure to make his invention obvious, the principle of the statute would seem to require denial of a patent to him. The same is true where a combination of two publications or patents makes the invention obvious and they both have dates more than a year before the filing date.</p>

We note that although “Diene rubber” was not compared with “FR 89-2” which contained 21.9% cis-1,4, it was compared with “FR 89-1” which contained 20.5% cis-1,4. The criticisms raised by the board and the solicitor may bear on the weight to be given the affidavit, but they do not preclude our consideration of the affidavit.</p>

However, the “Diene rubber” is clearly superior with regard to several other properties. Heat build up, as evidenced by relative energy absorption at constant force, is from about 53% to over 540% higher in the Binder polymers. The rebound value of the “Diene rubber” is from 40% to over 100% greater at room temperature and when cured in a tread stock from about 40% to 170% greater at room temperature and from 18% to about 200% greater at 212° F. than the rebound values of the Binder polymers. The “Diene rubber” resistance to low temperatures, as evidenced by Young’s Bending Modulus, is from 20% to 170% greater than that <a id="p1823" href="#p1823" data-label="1823" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1823</a>of the Binder polymers. It should be noted that in all of these tests the Binder “FE 89-1” butadiene homopolymer containing 20.5% <em>cis-1,i </em>performed the best or close to the best of all of the Binder polymers tested. We are convinced, however, that appellant’s “Diene rubber” containing 29.1% cis-1,4-poly butadiene has properties superior to and is patentable over the Binder polymers, all of which contain less than 23% cis-1,4-structure.</p>
    <p id="b1147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1147.4",1147,[196,646,1326,438]]]'>We have considered the solicitor’s argument that because natural rubber contains 97.8% cis-1,4-structure, it would be obvious to increase the cis-1,4 content of the Binder polymers to obtain the properties achieved by appellant in his “Diene rubber.” We cannot agree with this position. Natural rubber contains isoprene units, not butadiene units. Thus, appellant has discovered that his “Diene rubber” (polybutadiene) has properties similar to or better than natural rubber (polyisoprene). We, accordingly, <em>reverse </em>the rejection of claims 34 and 35.</p>
    <p id="b1147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1147.5",1147,[195,1102,1327,641]]]'>Another group of claims, 12, 13, 29, and 39, specifies a cis-1,4 content of as low as 23%, only a fraction of a percent more than the Binder polymers have. The board held that the affidavit failed to show a difference between the Binder polymers and the claimed 23% cis-1,4 polymers. Appellant has not introduced evidence to show that the 23% cis-1,4 containing polymer has properties differing in any way from the Binder polymers. Neither has he shown that the 23% cis-1,4 containing polymers are more closely related to his 29.1% cis-1,4 containing “Diene rubber” than to the Binder polymers. He has also failed to present arguments that the small percentage differences in the total 1,4 content are significant. Thus, we agree with the board that the mere difference of a fraction of a percent does not render the claims unobvious in view of Binder.</p>
    <p id="b1147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1147.6",1147,[195,1759,1327,237]]]'>Claims 17 and 18 are drawn to sulfur-cured vulcanizates of the 23% cis-1,4 containing polymers. Appellant has not argued that sulfur curing would be an unobvious treatment of the products. We thus agree with the solicitor that these claims must fall with the polymer claims.</p>
    <p id="b1147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1147.7",1147,[197,2011,1326,501]]]'>Product claims 30, 32, 33, 36, and 40 contain limitations specifying the method of forming the 23% cis-1,4 containing polymer, e.g., “said synthetic polymer being formed in the presence of an ionic catalyst in a substantially nonaqueous system * * *." While it is appellant’s position that high cis-1,4 contents cannot be achieved by Binder’s polymerization process, he has not argued in his brief that there is an unobvious difference between the claims based upon the method limitation. Because appellant has not shown that polymers containing 23% cis-1,4-structure produced according to his claims must differ significantly from the Binder polymers, we agree with the board.</p>

The affirmed rejection of claims as “unpatentable over” Binder may be a rejection for the reason that Poster’s invention was “described” by <a id="p1832" href="#p1832" data-label="1832" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1832</a>Binder within the meaning of section 102; or that the statutory bar of section 102(b) has resulted in a loss of right to patent; or that the Foster invention was obvious in view of Binder under the conditions specified in section 103. A rejection so vaguely stated does not discharge the statutory duty imposed on the Commissioner of Patents by section 132. Certainly, it does not provide “such information [to the applicant] * * * as may be useful in judging of the propriety of continuing the prosecution of his application.1' It furnishes, instead, a constantly shifting ground so that the statutory basis for the rejection by the examiner may well differ from that of the Board of Appeals, even as it affirms the examiner’s rejection. Under such circumstances, what issue may then be assigned as error for appeal to this court under 35 USC 142 and be relied on by us for decision under 35 USC 144? The burden on an applicant is quite different in meeting rejections made under sections 102 and 103. A rejection under section 102 involves a comparison between the subject matter disclosed by the reference and that claimed by the applicant, in order to determine whether the claimed invention is “described’’ in the reference. See, e.g., <em>In re Sheppard, </em><a href="/ccpa/52-2/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="52 C.C.P.A. 859" data-case-ids="12164136" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/0859-01">52 CCPA 859</a>, <a href="/ccpa/52-2/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="339 F.2d 238" data-case-ids="12164136,883943" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/0859-01,/f2d/339/0238-01">339 F. 2d 238</a>, <a href="/ccpa/52-2/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="52 C.C.P.A. 859" data-case-ids="12164136" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/0859-01">144 USPQ 42</a>. Section 103, on the other hand, requires consideration of the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, for the purpose of determining whether the claimed subject matter as a whole would have been “obvious” to one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the issues arising under the two sections are vastly different, and call for the production and introduction of quite different types of evidence.</p>

There can be no doubt that the language therein, when interpreted <em>literally </em>and standing alone, supports <em>Pálmquist. </em>But, as the majority makes so clear here, we misinterpreted Congressional intent there.

Thus, Greene’s application was co-pending with appellant’s, and Greene’s filing date was something over <em>three </em>years prior to appellant’s.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a>

Thus in considering the Greene patent as a reference, appellant’s invention would, under the <em>Harry </em>case, have become obvious as of the filing-date of the Greene application. Since that date is considerably more than one year prior to appellant’s filing date, it follows logically from the majority view here that appellant should have been denied his patent because as a matter of law Greene made the invention obvious more than one year prior to the filing date of the Foster application. This is the necessary result it seems to me of the rationale of the majority that an applicant loses his right to a patent under section 102(b) if he fails to file his application for patent within a year after the invention became obvious.</p>

The Patent Office applies the reasoning of the majority <em>only </em>where the <em>issue </em>date of the patent is more than one year prior to the applicant’s filing date. I am frankly unable to reconcile this anomaly (an example of which occurred in the <em>Palmquist </em>case as well) with the majority’s fundamental proposition that there is an established policy of refusing patents for inventions which have become obvious more than a year prior to filing the application therefor. No such policy is expressed either in section 102(b) or section 103. On the contrary, what the courts and Congress have said is that, if and when under <em>certain ex-press conditions </em>the invention becomes vested in the public more than one year prior to filing the application, then and <em>only </em>then is there a loss of right to patent. These conditions are stated in section 102(b) and clearly require that <a id="p1827" href="#p1827" data-label="1827" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1827</a>

      <em>Second: </em>Another example from which it can be seen that there is no such broad policy as stated by the majority, arises from a consideration of section 102(a) and what is meant by the term “known” as used therein. The case law indicates that for an invention to be “known,” the “knowledge” of it must be of a very special kind and quality in <a id="p1828" href="#p1828" data-label="1828" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1828</a>order to be effective as an anticipation.

Where words conflict with each other, where the different clauses of an instrument bear upon each other, and would be inconsistent, unless the natural and common import of the words be varied, construction becomes necessary, and a departure from the obvious meaning of words, is justifiable. But if, in any case, the plain meaning of a provision, not contradicted by any other provision in the same instrument, is to be disregarded, <em>because we believe the framers of the instrument could not intend what they say, </em>it must be one in which the absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case, would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application.

It is sufficient that a patent or a publication be found, or that some combination of the same can be put together after the applicant’s date of invention and with the accuracy characteristic of perfect hindsight which make the invention “obvious” more than one year prior to the date of filing the patent application. Thus, in addition to changing the wording of section 102(b) as above suggested, the majority must also intend to rewrite section 103 so that the phrase “at the time the invention was made” now is to be limited by a proviso which reduces this time to a period of one year prior to the filing of the application.</p>
