The trial court treated this case as if it were a traditional medical malpractice case and required appellants to provide a medical expert who would opine to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that hospital’s acts deviated from an acceptable medical standard and that such deviation was the proximate cause of appellant Sybil Matthews’ harm. When appellants failed to provide an expert report on the issue of causation in a timely fashion, the court entered summary judgment.</p>

On April 7, 1997, the court held a hearing on the motion for sanctions. In its order addressing the motion, the court indicated that the parties had discussed several issues, including the need for expert testimony as to causation, but that the issue was not properly before the court; therefore the court would not rule on it. (R.R. at 88a.) Nevertheless, the court invited either party to bring the issue before the court with an appropriate motion. <em>(Id.) </em>The court then ordered patient within 45 days to identify expert witnesses she intended to call and to provide hospital with copies of the expert reports, and instructed patient that if she did not comply, she would be precluded from introducing any expert testimony. In response, patient timely filed the expert report of Mary Rodgers Schubert, R.N., directed to the standard of care of operating room nurses, but did not file a report addressing the issue of causation.</p>
