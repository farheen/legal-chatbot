The Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Hartford) on the basis of its finding that plaintiff’s claim did not present the “real controversy” that is necessary for adjudication under the Declaratory Judgments Act. On appeal, we hold that the Superior Court erred in not reaching the merits of the question raised by plaintiff’s complaint. We nevertheless order summary judgment in favor of defendant Hartford because, as a matter of law, the section 68 lien does extend to the entire amount that plaintiff recovered from the <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>third party tortfeasor for bodily injury, including that part recovered for pain and suffering and other damages not compen-sable under the Workers’ Compensation Act.</p>
    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[223,489,747,413]]]'>On December 11, 1980, plaintiff sustained a back injury as a result of an automobile accident caused by the negligence of another driver. At the time of the accident plaintiff was an employee of NAS-CO, Inc., and was acting within the scope of his employment. NASCO was covered by a workers’ compensation insurance policy issued by Hartford.</p>
    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[220,924,749,1305]]]'>In his complaint and his subsequently filed affidavit, plaintiff Perry alleged that on February 20, 1981, he underwent back surgery for injuries sustained in the automobile accident. He was readmitted to the hospital on March 4, 1981, with massive gastro-intestinal bleeding, caused by medications administered for the back injury, and subsequently underwent a near total gastrectomy. As the result of his injuries Perry was totally disabled from December 11, 1980, until July 6, 1981. During that period Hartford paid Perry benefits of $284.38 per week and also paid medical bills on Perry’s behalf totalling $43,176.85. On July 6, 1981, Perry agreed to a discontinuance of benefits. Then, on July 8, 1981, he entered into a settlement agreement with the driver of the other car involved in the accident that awarded plaintiff $100,000, apparently the limit of the other driver’s insurance coverage. Of the $100,000 settlement, $51,555.64 was paid directly to Hartford in satisfaction of its section 68 lien for benefits and medical expenses previously paid to Perry or on his behalf, and $48,444.36 was paid to Perry himself.</p>

However, he returned to work and continued working until June 25, 1982, when he was disabled for a period of six weeks by hypoglycemia secondary to the dumping syndrome. The affidavit further stated that since returning to work following the second period of disability he has continued to suffer from intestinal problems culminating in additional surgery in 1983. Despite plaintiff’s petitions for payment of further compensation and medical expenses and for recovery for permanent impairment, Hartford made no payments after July 6, 1981, claiming a credit against plaintiff’s third party recovery not already paid to it, in the amount of $48,444.36. Plaintiff claimed that as of August 1, 1983, the date of his affidavit, he was owed benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act in excess of $20,000.</p>

Weeks, </em>the Superior Court held that because the settlement agreement between plaintiff and the third party tortfeasor failed to allocate a part of the settlement fund to pain and suffering, determination whether the section 68 lien reached portions of a settlement fund allo-cable to pain and suffering would amount to an advisory opinion. The Superior Court’s reliance on <em>Liberty Mutual </em>is misplaced. In that case, as in the present one, a workers’ compensation beneficiary sought a declaration that the employer’s section 68 lien did not extend to portions of a third party recovery allocable to pain and suffering. Although in <em>Liberty Mutual </em>the Superior Court decided other issues there presented, it did not rule on the pain and suffering issue. We upheld the court’s implicit refusal to consider that issue on the ground that because no amount of the third party recovery had been allocated to pain and suffering, “to rule upon the ... indeterminate or non-existent damages for pain and suffering ... would be to render an advisory opinion.” <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v.

The undisputed facts before the Superior Court did not demonstrate that Perry’s third party recovery for pain and suffering and other damages not compen-sable under the Workers’ Compensation Act was nonexistent or so indeterminate as to preclude the presence of a “real controversy.” On the contrary, in the present case, there is no doubt that plaintiff Perry sustained pain and suffering by reason of the injuries caused by the third party’s tort. The settlement agreement between Perry and the tortfeasor specifically provided that in consideration for the amount received by plaintiff, he discharged the third party from “any and all claims, demands, rights, and causes of action ... arising from ... bodily and personal injuries” resulting from the accident. Thus, in contrast to <em>Liberty Mutual, </em>here it is clear that plaintiff Perry did in fact settle all his claims, including his very real claims for pain and suffering. In his affidavit plaintiff states that at the time of settlement he was advised by the insurance carrier of the third party tortfeasor, “that the settlement included elements of pain and suffering.” Defendant has not contested that averment. Although plaintiff did not indicate what amount of the third party settlement was allocable to pain and suffering, the amount of those damages could be determined through further litigation.</p>

    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[997,247,747,1078]]]'>(Emphasis added) The highlighted portions of the statute make clear that the injured employee must “repay to the employer or compensation insurer,” out of the third party recovery, “the benefits paid” (less the employer’s or compensation insurer’s proportionate share of cost of collection). The language also makes plain that the employer’s lien “for the value of compensation paid” extends to “any damages” recovered. The statutory language does not delineate two categories of third party damages, one of which gives rise to the employer’s lien and the other of which does not; it creates a general right of reimbursement and a lien that is coextensive with the right. By the plain meaning of the statutory language, the employer’s lien extends to all of the third party recovery, including those portions attributable to pain and suffering and other damages not compensable under the Workers’ Compensation Act.</p>
