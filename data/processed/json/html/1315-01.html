    <p id="b1360-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1360.13",1360,[1008,337,750,1002]]]'>Plaintiff Country Business Services, Inc., appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court (York County) construing a brokerage agreement between plaintiff and defendant Albert Crawford. By a written contract executed on December 8, 1978, defendant retained plaintiff as the agent for the sale of his lobster and seafood business in Kittery. Upon the consummation of a sale, plaintiff was to receive “a commission of 10% of the total final selling price” to be paid “as payments [from the buyer] are received [by defendant].”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In March, 1979, plaintiff found a purchaser for defendant’s business at a total purchase price of $419,-564. The sales agreement called for the buyer to pay defendant $74,505 cash at the closing, with defendant taking for the balance two secured notes bearing 10% interest. At the closing, defendant paid plaintiff 10% of the initial payment, or $7,450.50.</p>
    <p id="b1360-16" data-blocks='[["BL_1360.14",1360,[1003,1367,749,615]]]'>For several months thereafter, defendant failed to tender to plaintiff a full 10% of the $3,881.88 he was receiving in equal monthly installment payments o£ principal and interest on the notes he had taken from his buyer. Plaintiff consequently instituted this action in the Superior Court, seeking a declaration that he was entitled to receive from defendant 10% of the total amount (principal plus interest) received each month by defendant from his buyer. Following a bench trial, the court issued its judgment, in defendant’s favor, that</p>

    <p id="b1361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1361.5",1361,[221,647,750,1286]]]'>At trial, the Superior Court justice admitted evidence relating to the entire oral transaction between the parties, but in his later written opinion he found the evidence cast no light upon the parties’ intentions with respect to the question whether the interest payments from defendant’s buyer would play any role in calculating the amount or the timing of commission payments. Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that the justice’s determination to that effect was not clearly erroneous. M.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Finding no interpretive assistance from the extrinsic evidence he received at trial, the justice construed the contract from the four corners of the printed instrument as modified in handwriting. He made a ruling of law on the meaning of the written brokerage contract. <em>Cf. LooseWiles Biscuit Co. v. Deering Village Corp., </em><a href="/me/142/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="142 Me. 121" data-case-ids="631704" data-case-paths="/me/142/0121-01">142 Me. 121</a>, 125, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="48 A.2d 715">48 A.2d 715</a>, 717 (1946) (interpretation of a written contract is a question of law for the court). The Law Court then reviews his interpretation of that written contract to determine whether his ruling of law was correct according to our own independent assessment of the contract terms.</p>

When construing a contract, a court will give the language its “plain, ordinary and generally accepted meaning.” <em>Loose-Wiles Biscuit Co. v. Deering Village Corp., supra </em>at 130, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="48 A.2d 715">48 A.2d at 719</a>. The meaning of “10% of the total final selling price,” the phrase used by the parties to fix the broker’s commission, could not logically be anything other than 10% of the selling price agreed upon between seller and buyer. Especially is that the case here, where the parties at the head of the contract stated an asking price of:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1361-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1361.10",1361,[1054,557,709,85]]]'>$195,000 + inventory at cost for the business. Land and buildings at $250,000.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1361-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1361.11",1361,[1017,667,747,327]]]'>The asking price thus totalled $445,000, exclusive of inventory, or about $25,000 more than the stated contract price eventually agreed upon between defendant and his buyer. Neither the asking price nor the “total final selling price” in the context includes any interest on deferred payments.</p>
    <p id="b1361-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1361.12",1361,[1015,1018,750,854]]]'>We do not, however, agree with the Superior Court’s interpretation of the term “payable as payments are received.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The justice below held that the brokerage commission was not to be computed on any additional amount to be received by defendant from his buyer as the result of any financing agreement between seller and buyer. Accordingly, on the timing of commission payments, the justice concluded, defendant must pay plaintiff 10% of only the principal portion of each monthly installment received by defendant-seller. Thus, nothing attributable to interest received by defendant from his buyer could, in the lower court’s view, be used even in calculating defendant’s monthly installment payments toward the total commission due plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b1361-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1361.13",1361,[1017,1901,749,611]],["BL_1362.1",1362,[215,258,752,921]]]'>The parties in handwriting substituted “as payments are received” in the contract for “in full in cash at closing,” the term used on Country Business’s printed form to describe the timing of payment of a brokerage commission. We understand the parties to have changed the contract language in order to indicate the time frame in which commission payments would be made in the event of a seller-financed transaction, namely, every month on the facts of this case, as defendant received in turn installment payments from his buyer. The pur<a id="p1318" href="#p1318" data-label="1318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1318</a>pose of the phrase “as payments are received” was patently to protect defendant in having sufficient funds to cover his commission payments. The only word now giving rise to any disagreement is “payments.” A “payment” is defined as merely “that which is paid.” <em>Webster’s New International Dictionary </em>1585 (1911). The combination of the reason for inserting the substitute term in handwriting and its plain and ordinary intendment defeats any attempt to limit its meaning to the note payment attributable to principal only, as opposed to the total amount paid each month to the seller. Absent some more clearly restrictive phraseology in the agreement referring only to that portion of payments attributable to principal, we will not construe this contract in a way at variance with the common meaning of its language.</p>
