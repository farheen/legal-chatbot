The mortgage was duly recorded. Campstead subsequently sold 2.457 acres, which First Eastern Bank released from the lien of its mortgage. Thereafter, Campstead conveyed the remaining 16.235 acres to Standard Retail Sales, Inc. This tract was not released from the lien of the mortgage and remained subject thereto. When Standard Retail Sales subsequently sold 11.003 acres, however, this portion was released from the lien of the mortgage. When the mortgage went into default on or about June 15, 1990, only 5.232 acres remained subject to the mortgage, and it was against this tract that mortgage foreclosure proceedings were commenced.</p>

A sale scheduled for February, 1991, was continued, and a continued sale on March 20, 1991, was stayed in response to a petition by Frontier. Following hearing, however, the petition was dismissed by the court on July 22, 1991. A petition to reissue the writ of execution was thereafter filed by First Eastern Bank, and a sheriffs sale was scheduled for December 11, 1991. Although Frontier was still not named as terre tenant, it was given notice by letter that the sheriffs sale had been scheduled for December 11, 1991. When A1 Saggese, an officer of Frontier, appeared at the time of the sale on December 11, however, he learned that the sale had been continued. When he inquired about a later date, he learned that a date certain had not been set. Later, the continued sale was rescheduled for January 29,1992. Notice of this sale, however, was not given to Frontier. Saggese, according to the uncontradicted testimony, learned of the continued sale on January 28, 1992, and appeared at the time of the sale on January 29, 1992. He did not bid at that time, and the real estate was sold to First Eastern Bank.</p>

The trial court subsequently held a hearing; but, on November 20, 1992, the court dismissed Frontier’s exceptions and petition to set aside the sheriffs sale. The sole reason given for its decision was that Sagg-ese had been present at the sale on January 29, 1992. Frontier appealed.</p>

When the Commonwealth exercises its sovereign power to extinguish property rights, strict compliance with the notice requirements set forth in our rules of civil procedure is especially important. I am also satisfied that Frontier’s actual notice, coming only the day before the sale, was insufficient to allow Frontier to meaningfully participate in the sheriffs sale. To hold otherwise would prejudice Frontier.</p>
    <p id="b1421-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1421.12",1421,[974,401,752,988]]]'>When, however, actual notice is ample, and lack of formal notice works no prejudice, we should not demand strict compliance with procedural rules for their own sake. As a general matter, we interpret our rules of civil procedure liberally, “to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable.” Pa.R.C.P., Rule 126, 42 Pa. C.S.A. Where appropriate, we may “disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.” Id This approach does not countenance the wholesale derogation of our procedural rules, but does allow us to bend them just a little where the interests of justice demand. I would not surrender this flexibility in favor of a uniform policy of super-strict compliance with procedural rules, when such compliance would only be pointless and burdensome.</p>
