At appellant’s first trial, held in early 2004, the court dismissed two of the counts on the government’s motion and the jury found appellant not guilty of eight other counts. The jury could not reach a verdict on the remaining fifteen counts. Appellant was retried on those counts in May and June of 2004.</p>

L.B. testified at trial that appellant befriended her after she met him in the attendance office at Ballou in her sophomore year. A troubled adolescent with a traumatic family background, L.B. found she could con<a id="p973" href="#p973" data-label="973" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*973</a>fide in appellant, whom she described as “nice.” Appellant listened to L.B. and assured her he would “be there” if she needed him. He bought her new shoes and called himself her “godfather.” He told L.B. she was pretty. After a while, L.B. claimed, he began telling her he wanted to have sex with her.</p>
    <p id="b1015-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1015.6",1015,[150,680,753,1375]]]'>According to L.B., their first sexual encounter occurred in the spring of her sophomore year, when she was fifteen years old. Appellant asked her to come with him to the school auditorium to help him set up some tables on the stage. Once they were there, L.B. claimed, appellant closed the curtain, turned off the lights, grabbed her, and forced her to submit to sexual intercourse against her will. A few months later, after L.B. turned sixteen, appellant began having sex with her on a regular, almost weekly basis. They met for that purpose either at Ballou or in appellant’s apartment. L.B. did not resist appellant’s advances or report him, she testified, “because at that time I didn’t think I had a choice.” She feared appellant would access the school computer system to change her grades (an ability he told her he possessed) and she “would fail.” In February 2003, however, L.B. contracted genital warts, a sexually transmitted condition. Only then, to a gynecologist who examined her, did L.B. disclose appellant’s abuse. At that point the police were notified.</p>

(simple assault and enticing a child) and K.H. (assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual abuse and simple assault). R.D. testified that appellant frequently made sexually suggestive comments to her when she was in his stage-crew class in her sophomore year. One morning, she testified, appellant approached her before class, made a sexual remark, and kissed her without warning on her lips. (This was the basis for the assault charge.) On another occasion, R.D. claimed, she was in the attendance office and appellant locked the door, turned off the lights, and proposed taking her to a hotel “and other stuff.” (This was the basis for the enticing count.) The charges involving K.H. related to an incident in her junior year in which appellant allegedly put his hand under her skirt and kissed her on the neck while she was trying to use the telephone in the school security office. K.H. reported the assault later that day. She testified that she was reluctant to do so because appellant had told her he could change students’ grades and she was afraid he would change hers.</p>

Qualified by the court as an expert on the sexual victimization of children, Lanning testified about the methods employed by preferential child molesters and the behavior of their victims. Lanning professed no knowledge about the facts of appellant’s case and <a id="p974" href="#p974" data-label="974" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*974</a>expressed no opinion on appellant’s guilt or the credibility of his accusers.

    <p id="b1016-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1016.5",1016,[192,497,749,982]]]'>Appellant’s defense was that the three teenaged complainants had fabricated their allegations against him. The defense focused in large part on their motives to lie about him, their delay in reporting his abuse, and the inconsistencies in their accounts. Appellant also presented evidence that he and L.B. had enjoyed a close, friendly relationship. Among other things, appellant’s wife testified that L.B. regularly visited them at their home. On cross-examination L.B. acknowledged that she continued to call appellant after he left Ballou, and that she sent him a school picture on which she had written “to my godfather and godmother” and “love you.” L.B. also admitted that her grades were poor and that appellant had never threatened explicitly to change them.</p>

The jury acquitted appellant of the remaining felony charges and of the charge of simple assault relating to K.H. It convicted appellant on the seven counts of misdemeanor sexual abuse of L.B. and on the count of simple assault against R.D. Subsequently, with the government’s agreement, the judge vacated appellant’s convictions on three of the misdemeanor sexual abuse counts on merger grounds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, at the end of the day, appellant stood convicted of four counts of misdemeanor sexual abuse and one count of simple assault.</p>

The government proffered Lanning as an “education” witness who would describe in general terms how “preferential” child molesters “groom” and manipulate their immature victims, how those victims become compliant and cooperate with their abusers, and how they delay reporting their abuse and provide inconsistent accounts because they feel shame, embarrassment and guilt on account of their acquiescence. In a motion filed in open court on the day of trial, and in extended argument on that motion, appellant objected to Lanning’s testimony on several grounds. Appellant argued that (1) Lanning’s proffered testimony was not beyond the ken of the average juror; (2) Lanning was not qualified to testify about victim behavior; (3) his method of classifying sex offenders was not generally accepted; and (4) his testimony about offenders would be substantially more prejudicial than probative. Appellant also expressed concern that the jury might take Lanning’s testimony about compliant victims to mean that consent would not be a defense even if the alleged victim was over the age of sixteen. The judge overruled appellant’s objections and permitted the government to call Lanning.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> To avoid unfair prejudice to appellant, the judge instructed the government to limit Lanning’s testimony <a id="p975" href="#p975" data-label="975" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*975</a>about characteristic traits of child molesters to the ones appellant allegedly had displayed. Additionally, the judge offered to instruct the jury specially on the issue of consent after Lanning testified.</p>
    <p id="b1017-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1017.6",1017,[150,532,753,1213]]]'>In his trial testimony, Lanning explained that his qualifications to testify about the sexual victimization of children rested primarily on his two decades of experience in the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit (BSU). According to Lanning, the work of the BSU involved applying the “knowledge of the behavioral sciences ... in a practical way to dealing with fact finding and investigation and prosecution of cases.” Lan-ning’s main focus at the BSU was on sexual offenses against children: he studied the behaviors of both offenders and victims in order to apply what he learned to the investigation and prosecution of child sex offense cases. Although Lanning was not trained as a psychologist or psychiatrist, he had earned a master’s degree in administration of justice and had completed the course work for a master’s degree in criminal justice. In the latter program, he testified, he took “a lot” of behavioral science classes, including classes on deviant sexual behavior and sex crimes.</p>
    <p id="b1017-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1017.7",1017,[148,1778,753,649]],["BL_1017.8",1017,[950,263,754,619]]]'>Lanning’s research in his years at the BSU chiefly consisted of studying thousands of case files that had been compiled for law enforcement purposes. He estimated that 400 to 500 of the files he had studied involved teenaged victims, approximately half of them adolescent girls who had been victimized by adult males. Although Lanning had not interviewed these victims personally, he worked directly with the investigators who had done so. Lanning testified that he had published the fruits of his research on child sexual victimization in “numerous articles and chapters,” such as a “widely disseminated” monograph entitled “Child Molesters, a Behavioral Analysis for Law Enforcement,” and a book chapter entitled “Sexual Exploitation of Children.” His writings had appeared in publications of the FBI and the National Center for Exploited and Missing Children, among other organizations. All his published writings, Lanning stated, had passed through peer review of some kind.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b1017-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1017.10",1017,[950,934,752,734]]]'>Lanning also had consulted on thousands of child sex cases and participated in hundreds of training courses all over the world on the sexual victimization of children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In the latter connection, Lanning said, he had worked with professionals in the areas of social work, mental health and medicine, as well as with law enforcement personnel and victim advocates. In addition, Lanning had testified as an expert witness on child sex abuse in approximately fifty court proceedings throughout the United States and on seven occasions before Congress.</p>

His typology looked at child molesters “along a continuum from situational to preferential.” Preferential offenders are those who have a clear and persistent sexual preference, “most often <a id="p976" href="#p976" data-label="976" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*976</a>for children.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The most successful preferential abusers are typically “nice guys,” often authority figures such as teachers, who employ age-old techniques of seduction, or what Lanning called “grooming.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The key feature of this grooming process is that the abuser identifies and tries to fill a child’s needs, for example by listening sympathetically to the child, complementing her on her looks, giving her hugs, and buying her things she needs.</p>
    <p id="b1018-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1018.5",1018,[187,849,750,1275]]]'>After having formed a relationship of trust and dependence, the abuser undertakes to manipulate the child’s feelings and overcome her sexual inhibitions. Contrary to popular belief, Lanning explained, child molesters usually do not force themselves on their victims; in fact, only about 10 to 15 per cent of child sex offenses involve “extreme violence.” The preferential abuser’s goal is to bond with the child in order to control her psychologically. Children from dysfunctional homes, especially teenagers, are most susceptible to being groomed in this way, Lanning said. He added, however, that preferential child molesters “may” employ such unsavory tactics as exposing children to pornography, supplying them with drugs and alcohol, blackmailing them, and coercing their silence by threats of suicide. As one example of the use of blackmail or threats he had observed in cases involving child molesters who were teachers, Lanning mentioned “not giving [students] a proper grade, giving them the wrong grade.”</p>
    <p id="b1018-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1018.6",1018,[189,2148,748,246]],["BL_1018.7",1018,[985,267,754,871]]]'>The grooming process results in what Lanning called “compliant victims” — children who cooperate in their victimization. Their non-resistance may seem to indicate consent, Lanning stated; indeed, the children may return to their abusers and even enjoy the sexual activity. However, Lan-ning opined, compliant victims “suffer a lifetime of shame, embarrassment and guilt because their victimization does not fit society’s understanding” that children do not willingly acquiesce in abuse. According to Lanning, those feelings help explain why victimized children fail to disclose or delay disclosure of their abuse, and why their disclosures often contain “incomplete,” “inaccurate,” “distorted,” or “contradictory” information. (On cross-examination, Lanning conceded that some children may give contradictory accounts of abuse simply because they are being untruthful.)</p>
    <p id="b1018-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1018.9",1018,[986,1174,753,868]]]'>Although appellant did not raise consent as his defense at trial, he repeated his concern that the jury could misunderstand Lanning’s testimony about compliant victims to mean that consent by an individual over sixteen years of age would not be a defense to a sex abuse charge. To prevent that misunderstanding, the judge instructed the jury immediately after Lanning was excused on the defense of consent in the District of Columbia. The judge cautioned the jury that Lanning did not use the word “consent” in its legal meaning and that his testimony did not furnish “any legal guidance” on the issue of appellant’s guilt or innocence. Appellant does not challenge the instruction’s adequacy.</p>

Lanning admitted knowing nothing about the facts of appellant’s case and never opined that appellant fit any sort of profile of a child molester. Indeed, Lanning did not purport to provide such a profile at all; he made it clear that not all child molesters behaved in the same way or employed the unsavory tactics he described.

Appellant argues that he preserved his current <em>Frye </em>challenge because, in critiquing Lanning's qualifications (not his methodology), he made the assertion in passing that "Lanning’s analysis cannot be construed as scientific in any regard.” In context, however, this assertion was directed at Lanning’s typology of offenders. In our view, it was not sufficient to alert the trial judge that appellant claimed the methodology underlying Lan-ning’s testimony about victim psychology was not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Appellant argues that "once a claim is properly presented to the trial court, a party can make any argument in the appellate court in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments made below.” <em>Randolph v.
