    <p id="b1085-16" data-blocks='[["BL_1085.14",1085,[943,336,747,506]]]'>The Superior Court (York County) dismissed for untimeliness a complaint, brought by the Town of Old Orchard Beach and the Old Orchard Beach Public Safety Commission (“the Town”), seeking judicial review of an adverse decision and order of the Maine Labor Relations Board. The sole issue on appeal is whether the complaint was timely under 26 M.R.S.A. § 968(5)(F) (Supp.1982-1983),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which states, in pertinent part:</p>

    <p id="b1085-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1085.16",1085,[944,1193,750,794]]]'>The record in this case shows that on September 27, 1982, the Maine Labor Relations Board issued a “decision and order” finding that the Town had engaged in prohibited practices, as that term is defined in 26 M.R.S.A. § 964 (1974). The Town was ordered to cease and desist from those practices and to take affirmative action to remedy its errors. The decision and order was mailed to the Town’s counsel, return receipt requested, that same day. It was received by that attorney’s office staff the next day, September 28. The Town’s complaint, seeking judicial review, was filed in the Superi- or Court on October 14,1982. We hold that the complaint was timely and we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

Reading subsections 5(F) and 5(C) together, it seems clear that the “effective date” of the decision and <a id="p1056" href="#p1056" data-label="1056" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1056</a>order here appealed from must be the date on which it was served upon the party found to have engaged in prohibited practices.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="A4ve" data-blocks='[["BL_1086.4",1086,[206,463,745,584]]]'>Section 968(5)(F) further specifies that a complaint for review of a Board decision shall be filed "in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80B." By referring to Rule 80B the statute incorporates the whole Rules of Civil Procedure, so far as applicable, because Rule 80B itself in turn states that proceedings for review of agency action by the Superior Court shall "be governed by these Rules of Civil Procedure." We, therefore, must consult the civil procedure rules to determine whether the Town's complaint was timely.</p>
