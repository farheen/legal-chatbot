Upon arriving at the scene around 7:00 a.m., the [trooper] saw the two cars and approached the nearer vehicle. The driver, Appellant, appeared to be asleep and was startled when the [trooper] awoke him. When Appellant opened his car door, [Trooper] Dembowski detected the odor of alcohol in the vehicle and emanating from Appellant, whose speech was slurred. Since there was no suitable terrain nearby for a field sobriety test, [Trooper] Dembowski immediately placed Appellant under arrest for DUI and took him to York Hospital to determine his blood alcohol content.</blockquote>

Trooper Dembowski received a radio dispatch to investigate debris reported on the roadway at mile marker 38 southbound on Interstate 83, which is in York County. Trooper Dem-bowski was also advised that vehicles had hit the debris and were disabled at that location. This call was received by Trooper Dembowski “[e]arly in the morning just after getting dressed in uniform and getting in [his] car ready to go [...].” N.T. Jury Trial, 7/8/08, at 19.</p>

He parked behind the vehicle second in line, which upon investigation disclosed that Appellant was behind the steering wheel and appeared to be sleeping. When Trooper Dembowski knocked on the driver’s window, Appellant “jerked” his head up and looked at the trooper. During Trooper Dembowski’s conversation with Appellant, he noticed an odor of alcohol on Appellant’s breath and that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Thereafter, Trooper Dembowski asked Appellant to exit the vehicle because he “did believe that [Appellant] was under the influence of [an] alcoholic beverage [...].” N.T. Jury Trial, 7/8/08, at 22. No field-sobriety tests were performed at that time (7:00 a.m.) because Interstate 83 southbound had “a considerable amount of traffic,” the terrain was not level (because of a severe incline), and for the safety of both Appellant and Trooper Dembowski. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>

Further, Trooper Dembowski did an inventory search of Appellant’s vehicle and found no contraband or weapons. More particularly, Trooper Dembowski “didn’t find any alcoholic beverages in the vehicle, [but he] did observe that the keys were actually in the ignition of the vehicle [... ].” N.T. Jury Trial, 7/8/08, at 24. Once Appellant’s vehicle was towed, he was transported to York Hospital “[s]hortly before 8:00 [a.m.,]” and his blood was drawn with his consent at 8:00 a.m. <em>Id. </em>The parties stipulated that the BAC was .188 percent.</p>

He had a time frame where he advised that he had at least four drinks. He advised that he was drinking Rumplemint, which I believe he said was a flavored liquor.” N.T. Jury Trial, 7/8/08, at 27. Furthermore, Trooper Dembowski asked Appellant when he hit the object in the roadway, “and [Appellant] approximated the time that he struck the debris between 0610 and 0615[,]” which was within the two-hour window to draw one’s blood pursuant to Section 3802. <em>Id.</em>

Mr. Peck testified that his vehicle was not the first to make contact with the debris.

Jury Trial, 7/8/08, at 32, 34. When Mr; Peck struck the debris, he put his four-ways on and pulled alongside the road, all of which occurred at approximately 6:30 a.m. on November 20, 2007. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 35. Appellant and Mr. Peck conversed on at least two occasions exchanging information about having used their cell telephones to call “911” and making contact with the debris in the southbound lane of Interstate 83. <em>Id. </em>at 37. Mr. Peck also recalled using his cell phone and Trooper Dembowski arriving “about 20 minutes after we hit it[, <em>i.e., </em>the debris].” <em>Id. </em>at 32. Mr. Peck stated Trooper Dembowski’s arrival time was around “say 7, 7:15.” <em>Id. </em>at 35.

Thereafter, Mr. Peck used his cell phone to call “911,” and Trooper Dem-bowski arrived at approximately 7:00 a.m., which this time is consistent with the testimony of Trooper Dembowski. Lastly, during the passage of time between Appellant’s admission to driving to Trooper Dembowski (6:10 a.m. or 6:15 a.m.), Mr. Peck’s accident (6:30 a.m.), and Trooper Dembowski’s arrival on the scene (7:00 a.m.), Mr. Peck testified without equivocation that he did not witness Appellant consume anything during this hiatus of police presence on the scene, which is at odds with Appellant’s account of consuming alcohol “after” the accident while seated in his vehicle waiting for roadside service. N.T.

Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Hillyard observed a vehicle “almost over the hillside” at the top of the hill on Bettis Road. According to Officer Hillyard, the vehicle had rotated 180 degrees and come to rest “into some brush.” Standing outside the vehicle were two men. Officer Hillyard approached the two men and began questioning them as to what had happened. The two men were subsequently identified as Appellant and his brother, Thomas. While questioning Appellant, Officer Hillyard detected a strong odor of alcohol. Appellant indicated to Officer Hillyard that he had been driving the vehicle westbound on Bettis Road when he lost control of the vehicle while arguing with his brother. Upon being asked, Appellant admitted that he had been drinking alcohol that night. Appellant indicated that he and his brother had been at a local club drinking and that he was driving his brother home.</blockquote>

There were no witnesses to the accident or to the manner in which the car was operated. Rather, here, the state offered only (a) the time the officer received the call from dispatch about the accident and (b) the time that the officer arrived on the scene. It did not indicate when dispatch received the call about the accident, the name of the person who called dispatch, whether the person who called dispatch actually saw the accident or only came upon it some time later, or what time the caller first saw the accident. The officer testified that he did not know, when he arrived at the scene, how long Appellant’s car had actually been located at the scene of the accident. And he acknowledged that he never asked Appellant if he had been at the scene the entire time since the accident occurred.</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 846 (quoting the appellant’s brief, at 15-16). In light of these arguments, we concluded in <em>Segida </em>that the Commonwealth had failed to “establish, within some degree of reasonable certainty, the time [the appellant] last drove, as well as when the blood or breath sample was taken,” which we determined was essential for a conviction under 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802. <em>Id. </em>at 845-46.

Tied somewhat to the failure to establish when the accident occurred, the Commonwealth similarly fails to preclude the possibility that Appellant ingested alcohol after the accident occurred. Officer Hillyard did not testify as to whether there were signs of imbibing alcohol in the car or nearby, or whether there were drinking establishments nearby which would have provided Appellant an opportunity to drink after he stopped driving. This fact provides greater uncertainty to the premise that Appellant’s incapacity during the encounter with Officer Hillyard was representative of his incapacity when he was driving, thereby further undermining the Commonwealth’s case.</blockquote>

First, there was no testimony or evidence proffered establishing what time the police dispatcher received the call reporting the two disabled vehicles. We also note that, even if the Commonwealth had put forth evidence of the time of the call to police, the dispatcher informed Officer Dembowski that two cars were disabled. Thus, the time of the call would not have revealed exactly what time the first car, <em>ie. </em>Appellant’s car, had pulled alongside the highway. Furthermore, the Commonwealth presented no witnesses who saw Appellant actually hit the debris, nor anyone who could testify as to the manner in which Appellant was driving before hitting it.. When Mr. <a id="p1223" href="#p1223" data-label="1223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1223</a>Peck collided with the debris at approximately 6:30 a.m., Appellant’s car was already disabled alongside the highway.</p>
    <p id="b1271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1271.4",1271,[152,450,755,791]]]'>¶ 4 Instead, the only evidence that the Commonwealth presented to establish what time Appellant’s car became disabled was Officer Dembowski’s testimony. The officer testified that at Appellant’s preliminary hearing, Appellant indicated that he hit the debris around 6:10 or 6:15 a.m. However, on cross-examination at trial, the officer contradicted that testimony when asked if “the incident initially occurred prior to 6:00 or right around 6:00 [a.m.]” and the officer stated, “Okay.” N.T. Trial, 7/8/08, at 29. Thus, the evidence presented by the Commonwealth on the actual time that Appellant last drove his vehicle was minimal at best.</p>
    <p id="b1271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1271.5",1271,[150,1272,756,845]]]'>¶ 5 Moreover, here, as in <em>Segida, </em>the Commonwealth failed to preclude the possibility that Appellant consumed alcohol after driving. First, Appellant testified that after his car became disabled, he drank alcohol that was in a club soda bottle in his car. While Officer Dembowski testified that he did not find any alcoholic beverage containers in Appellant’s vehicle, he admitted on cross-examination that he may have seen a can of iced tea in the car, but could not recall if there were any other non-alcoholic drink containers in the vehicle. N.T. Trial, 7/8/08, at 24. <em>Id. </em>at 28. Thus, the Commonwealth did not present evidence refuting Appellant’s claim that there was a club soda bottle in his vehicle.</p>

However, Mr. Peck testified that his car hit the debris at approximately 6:30 a.m. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Appellant’s car hit the debris at 6:10 or 6:15 a.m., there were fifteen to twenty minutes where Appellant was alone at the scene in his disabled car. Thus, Appellant had fifteen to twenty minutes in which he could have consumed alcohol.</p>
    <p id="b1271-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1271.8",1271,[954,511,755,863]]]'>¶ 7 Accordingly, I believe that, even in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there are too many uncertainties in this case to say that the evidence was sufficient to find every element of DUI under 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802(c) beyond a reasonable doubt. The uncertainty about the exact time that Appellant last drove his vehicle, combined with the possibility that Appellant consumed alcohol after his car became disabled, creates a reasonable doubt as to Appellant’s guilt on the DUI charge. Thus, I believe that in accordance with this Court’s decision in <em>Segida, </em>we are constrained to conclude that Appellant’s DUI conviction and ensuing sentence should be reversed.</p>

As such, the only issue addressed by our Supreme Court in <em>Segida </em>was whether this Court erred in determining that the evidence was insufficient to sustain Segida’s conviction under section 3802(a)(1).
