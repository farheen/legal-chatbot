The Board of Appeals affirmed this decision on October 31, 1928. On Decern-* ber 10, 1928, the applicant made his motion for a rehearing, and in support thereof filed an elaborate brief and argument and, in addition thereto, the affidavit of John B.

      <a id="p1176" href="#p1176" data-label="1176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1176</a>The applicant’s process is roughly outlined in his claim, namely, he proposes to heat the ores which are to be reduced, to a reducing temperature and, when they arrive at the precise temperature when reduction will occur, to inject into them a hydrocarbon, either solid or liquid. He claims that because of this addition of hydrocarbons at this particular temperature, the carbon will be freed from the hydrocarbons at the exact moment the oxygen is set free from the ores; that the carbon, being nascent, as the applicant terms it, will be more active than if it had been previously separated and had been deposited upon the ores in a solid form. He claims by this process reduction is speedier and can be accomplished at lower temperatures than by the methods heretofore known to the art. The generally accepted former method, .as he represents, of reducing ores, was to mix a charge of ores and some solid hydrocarbon, usually coke, in a furnace and subject them to heat to such a degree that reduction was finally effected. In this process, however, no attempt was made to insert the hydrocarbons at any particular period of the process. Both ores and hydrocarbons accompanied each other throughout the process.</p>
    <p id="b626-3" data-blocks='[["BL_626.4",626,[267,1179,1321,993]]]'>In describing his process, appellant specifies that the reduction should take place in a chamber or cylinder from which air is excluded, the ores to be fed into the top and passed gradually downward by a system of baffles or intermittent movement by which the ores are kept in constant agitation. He illustrates his process by taking for example iron oxide ore. This he first crushes to approximately ^4-inch mesh and passes it through a hopper down through baffles in a brick tower. The bottom of the tower is heated by a flame of gas, oil, or coal. The heat from this flame becomes less intense as the distance up the tower away from the flame increases. As the 'ores are passed down through the tower, which occurs in a certain fixed time, they gradually arrive at the reducing temperature. At this point, an injection of hydrocarbon, or hydrocarbon containing body, is thrown into the ores. The hydrocarbon at once decomposes, the carbon unites with the oxygen in the ores, and the reduced material is, to prevent reoxidation, at once drawn from the tower into a cooling cylinder before coming in contact with the flame. The applicant states that this process is so efficacious, that he has been able to reduce magnetite ore, the normal reduction temperature of which is 1,100° C., at a temperature of about 950° C.</p>

    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[75,581,1329,649]]]'>Alford proposes to carry on his process by means of an apparatus briefly described as follows: He provides a furnace and firebox fed with fuel from above. The ore is heated and finally reduced in two rotatable tubes extending longitudinally, one above the other, through the two compartments of the furnace. The upper tube is described as an ore heating tube and the lower one as a reduction tube. Ore is fed into one end of the upper tube, propelled through it by an Archi-medean screw, and is discharged from the other end into a chute, from which it passes into the end of the lower reduction tube, through which it is likewise propelled by a similar screw. As the ore passes through the chute, powdered or crushed coal or carbon is added to it, which has been fed down an inclined tube, which tube leads from the outside, through the spent gases above the heating stove.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.6",627,[80,1237,1330,486]]]'>Alford’s specifications recite, on this point: <em>“ </em>said ore being advanced through the tube until it is discharged in a properly heated condition into a chute 22 which in turn discharges <em>the ore (mixed with carbon) </em>into the intake end of the reduction tube 15.” (Italics are ours.) Again he says: “ It follows from the foregoing that the-heated ore and reduction carbon are jointly fed into the reduction tube 15 where they are intimately mixed by the screw a.” Reduction is said to occur in the lower tube and the metal is drawn from the lower end of a Y at the end, the gases escaping from the upper end thereof.</p>
    <p id="b627-7" data-blocks='[["BL_627.7",627,[84,1741,1328,335]]]'>Alford states that his temperature in his reduction tube 15 will approximate 1,100° F., while the temperature in his upper ore-heating tube is 1,300° F., and in the carbon tube about 800° F.. He states that while the temperature in the upper heating tube may be 1,300° F., it “ must never reach the temperature of fusion.” The gist of his invention is stated in his sixth claim, which is as follows:</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[251,694,1322,639]]]'>A great deal has been said, in argument, about the various temperatures which Alford’s process creates and their reducing effect on ores generally. Comment is also made by appellant upon the alleged fact that Alford’s reduction tube, being of metal, will itself be reduced at the reducing temperature of its contents. With these questions of operativeness we are not now concerned. It is sufficient to note that there is an essential difference in the processes of appellant and Alford and that Alford’s disclosure does not read on appellant’s rejected claims. The examiner, we think, falls into error in stating that Alford gives 1,000° F. as the reducing temperature. What Alford states is that “ no reduction of iron can take place under 1,000 degrees,” which is a much different proposition.</p>
    <p id="b628-6" data-blocks='[["BL_628.7",628,[252,1350,1321,294]]]'>The examiner states that “ the functional, limitation c thereby producing nascent carbon,’ per se, is, clearly, of no patentable significance.” Doctor Cain, whose knowledge of the subject is extensive and thorough, states in his affidavit that this production of nascent carbon at the very moment of reduction has great metallurgical significance. His reasons for this view are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b628-7" data-blocks='[["BL_628.8",628,[251,1667,1322,531]]]'>Coley’s reducing agent is an active form of carbon which' is generated in immediate contact with the ore to be reduced by reason of the cracking of the oil, coal or other suitable hydrocarbon which he injects into or onto the ore that has previously been heated to 950° to 1,000° C.; the cracking of the hydrocarbon is effected mainly by the high temperature he uses. Coley claims that this form of carbon is highly efficient in reduction operations, and I believe this to be so, for it is evident that he accomplishes at least three things highly favorable to a quick and effective reduction: <em>(a) </em>He obtains the very finely divided, ilocculent form of carbon that results from suitably cracking or decomposing hydrocarbons; (6) He deposits this carbon upon and between the ore particles, or liberates it in such fashion that there is the intimate contact necessary for reduction; (c) He has his ore at a very high temperature favorable for immediate reduction by the active carbon.</blockquote>

Certainly, Alford indicates no such temperatures in his process. <a id="p1179" href="#p1179" data-label="1179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1179</a>Cain also sets out quite clearly that the powdered coal or carbon used in Alford’s process reaches a temperature of 800° F. before it enters the mass of ore and that, doubtless, at least partial carbonization thereof would occur before the ores reached a reduction temperature. In support of his propositions he cites various authorities, which, on examination, seem to indicate the correctness of his theories.

Fieldner, entitled “ Low Temperature Carbonization of Coal Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 1, Table 20.</p>

This Jones proposes to do by the use of natural gas, or a hydrocarbon gas of similar composition, as a “reducing, carbonizing, and cooling agent.” Jones employs a vertical furnace surrounding a central stack, in which reduction is to take place. Heat is applied from the sides, at the base of the furnace, to the exterior of the central stack. This stack extends below the base of the furnace a considerable distance, giving the material in the base of the furnace an opportunity to cool somewhat before the products of reduction are drawn off.

    <p id="b631-6" data-blocks='[["BL_631.7",631,[85,1483,1329,537]]]'>The solicitor for the Patent Office cites, as an additional reference in his brief filed in this court, the patent to Kendall, No. 721092, February 17, 1903. He contends this patent is a full and complete anticipation of appellant’s application even if the Alford and Jones patents are not. The Kendall patent was not referred to in the Patent Office during the hearing on this application, either by the examiner or the board, and its attempted citation here is some indication that there is some doubt in the solicitor’s mind as to whether the Jones and Alford references are sufficient justification for rejection of this application. The appellant vigorously insists we should not consider the same here.</p>

    <p id="b632-3" data-blocks='[["BL_632.4",632,[245,339,1322,346]]]'>The rules of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia heretofore adopted, so far as applicable, by this court, provide (Rule XXII), that the Patent Office shall verify all papers and evidence in the matter to this court and that these, with the petition for appeal, shall constitute the record to be considered by the court. This has been done in the case at bar, and no reference to the Kendall patent appears therein.</p>
    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[242,693,1324,648]]]'>It is urged that the court may take judicial notice of the Kendall patent. Whether we may or may not do so is a matter, in our judgment, not necessary for our consideration. It is quite certain that if we were to here consider reference patents for the first time, we should speedily find ourselves usurping the functions of the Patent Office. The appellant has the right to have the decision of the tribunals of the Patent Office upon the Kendall reference, if it is to be cited against him. If rejected by the office upon that reference, he might amend under section 4903- K. S. and possibly avoid the reference, something which he may not do in this court. The rules of orderly practice and reason both require that we should not consider for the first time, on appeal, references cited against an application. <em>In re </em>Gillam, <a href="/ccpa/17-2/0877-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="17 C.C.P.A. 877" data-case-ids="6094882" data-case-paths="/ccpa/17-2/0877-01">17 C.
