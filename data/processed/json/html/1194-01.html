The primary issue on appeal is whether the Superior Court has the authority to order a hearing committee to reconvene and to conduct a rehearing of departmental charges brought against a Rhode Island State Trooper.

In particular, Denisewich was charged with failure to abide by the law, Rhode Island State Police Rules and Regulations, ch. II, § 1 (1986); failure to abide by the Rules and Regulations of the Rhode Island State Police, <em>id. </em>§ 2; and conduct unbecoming an officer, <em>id. </em>§ 8.

Denisewich’s investigation prompted him to arrest the automobile’s two occupants and seize a briefcase from inside the automobile. The briefcase was later found to contain a large quantity of cocaine, and the two occupants (defendants) were subsequently charged with various offenses related to the possession of the cocaine. During a hearing in 1988 on defendants’ motion to suppress as evidence the briefcase seized in the arrest, <a id="p1196" href="#p1196" data-label="1196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1196</a>Denisewich testified about the condition of the locks on the briefcase at the time the briefcase was seized compared to their condition at the time of the suppression hearing. This testimony prompted an investigation by the State Police that focused on whether Denisewich had tampered with the locks on the briefcase after he had made the arrest. The investigation resulted in Denisewieh’s indictment on two counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice. In February 1989, after a jury trial in Superior Court, Denisewich was acquitted of all charges contained in the indictment.</p>

The grand jury testimony, however, was not introduced at the July 1991 hearing because the testimony was not available to the State Police’s attorney who prosecuted the case. Thus, the hearing committee did not have an opportunity to consider that testimony during its deliberations on the departmental charges and, in January 1992, unanimously found Denisewich not guilty of the departmental charges.

The trial justice ruled that there was no basis in law for the Superior Court to order the hearing committee to reconvene and thus denied the motion.

In light of the statutory framework, we do not purport to exercise a power to compel such a legislatively created quasi-judicial body to reconvene in compliance with our order. But our review of the Officer’s Bill of Rights and the expansive powers conferred upon the hearing committee thereunder leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the hearing committee is obligated to reconvene for the purpose of considering the relevance and materiality of the grand jury testimony. At such a reconvening, the committee, subject to its discretion, would be in a position to evaluate whether its original determination was proper or was flawed in light of the evidence now made available for its consideration. In so ruling, we note that sound public policy in support of finality in administrative decisions requires that a request for reconvening or reconsideration of a committee’s decision must be made within a reasonable time after the issuance of a committee’s decision. <em>See Handlon, </em><a href="/nj/4/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="4 N.J. 99" data-case-ids="110789" data-case-paths="/nj/4/0099-01">4 N.J. at 106-07</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20A.2d%20624" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="71 A.2d 624">71 A.2d at 627</a>.

Since the time of the original hearing and decision, one member of the committee has retired from membership on a police force. The hearing committee, as required by § 42-28.6-l(B)(l) of the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights, must be composed “of three (3) active law enforcement officers.” Because one member of the committee has retired and thus no longer is an “active” member of the police force, Denisewich argued that the retired officer is ineligible to serve on the hearing committee.

Pursuant to § 12-17-15, Denisewich was granted immunity against <a id="p1199" href="#p1199" data-label="1199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1199</a>criminal prosecution stemming from the grand jury testimony. <em>See State v.

Therefore, the introduction of the grand jury testimony at the Officers’ Bill of Rights hearing can subject Denisewich only to liability for the potential loss of employment — a consequence to which the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply. <em>Apfelbaum, </em><a href="/us/445/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="445 U.S. 115" data-case-ids="1777315" data-case-paths="/us/445/0115-01">445 U.S. at 125</a>, <a href="/us/445/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="445 U.S. 115" data-case-ids="1777315" data-case-paths="/us/445/0115-01">100 S.Ct. at 954</a>, <a href="/us/445/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="445 U.S. 115" data-case-ids="1777315" data-case-paths="/us/445/0115-01">63 L.Ed.2d at 259</a>. Consequently we hold that the grand jury testimony is properly admissible at a rehearing on the departmental charges against Denisewich.</p>
