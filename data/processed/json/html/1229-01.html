This Court affirmed his conviction and the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole that was imposed by the trial justice. <em>See State v. McManus, </em><a href="/a2d/941/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="941 A.2d 222" data-case-ids="8394116" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0222-01">941 A.2d 222</a> (R.I.2008). While defendant was being held without bail at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) awaiting trial on the murder charge at the Intake Service Center (Intake), his interaction with four of his fellow inmates are of consequence in this case. The record discloses that Arthur Pine, Mark Pine,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Robert Smith, and Vincent Arruda, were approached individually by defendant, who wanted to hire a person or people to commit murder and felony assault against the Attorney General and the prosecutor assigned to the case. The defendant was charged, by way of grand jury indictment, with three counts:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> criminal solicitation of Arthur Pine to commit murder in violation of G.L.1956 § 11-1-9; criminal solicitation of Vincent Arruda to commit murder in violation of § 11-1-9; criminal solicitation of Robert Smith to commit murder and/or assault with a dangerous weapon in viola<a id="p1232" href="#p1232" data-label="1232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1232</a>tion of § 11-1-9.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In its case in chief, the state called the four men, all of whom were alleged to have engaged in these conversations with defendant.</p>
    <p id="b1274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1274.5",1274,[190,484,752,1230]]]'>Arthur testified about meeting defendant at Intake; he explained that the two developed a relationship such that defendant asked Arthur, “how much to take care of [the Attorney General]?” When Arthur inquired of defendant how the murder of the Attorney General would help his case, defendant replied, “It’s going to do me a lot of good * * * [he] is using my kids to testify against me.” The defendant went on to describe in detail how the murder should take place. Specifically, defendant wanted the Attorney General to be shot two times — -one bullet for each of defendant’s children- — because the prosecution intended to call them as trial witnesses in the underlying murder case. Arthur testified that he took copious notes of his various conversations with defendant and eventually went to his correctional officers with this information. An investigation by the state police and the Office of the Attorney General ensued. However, the jury rejected Arthur’s testimony.</p>
    <p id="b1274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1274.6",1274,[188,1744,752,610]]]'>Mark Pine, Arthur’s brother and fellow inmate, was the second witness to testify about the solicitation. He testified that he met defendant through his brother, while both were at Intake. According to Mark, defendant was aware of the state police investigation and repeatedly asked Mark to tell his attorney that Arthur was lying. Mark testified that defendant, yet again, described in detail how he wanted the Attorney General killed and that he wanted someone to break Lynch’s legs.</p>
    <p id="A8R" data-blocks='[["BL_1274.7",1274,[989,260,753,1079]]]'>The crux of this case, however, turns on the testimony, or lack of testimony, of Robert Smith, another jailhouse informant. When Smith was called to testify, he claimed to have suffered an unfortunate and total failure of memory about everything he previously had disclosed to law enforcement, including his police statement and grand jury testimony. The record discloses that Smith was at Intake during the period when defendant actively was recruiting others to carry out his criminal enterprise. During a long discussion with investigators, Smith described his relationship with defendant and disclosed that defendant sought Smith’s help in murdering the Attorney General and assaulting Lynch. According to Smith, defendant offered him $5,000 for his services. Smith also gave detailed testimony before the grand jury.</p>
    <p id="b1274-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1274.11",1274,[986,1381,755,973]],["BL_1275.1",1275,[156,248,750,397]]]'>However, when testifying at trial, Smith professed a total failure of memory about everything concerning the incident, including his discussions with the state police. After some initial examination, the prosecutor treated Smith as an adverse witness and began to use leading questions. The trial justice allowed the state’s use of leading questions, over defense counsel’s continuing objection. The prosecutor continued to pose leading questions — an effort that spanned fifty-one pages of trial transcript. Defense counsel objected and argued that continuing this line of inquiry was not only fruitless, but was having a prejudicial effect on the jury. The trial justice responded: “[The prosecutor] hasn’t been through the whole thing yet. I’m prepared to stay here all day while <a id="p1233" href="#p1233" data-label="1233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1233</a>[Smith] either answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ that he doesn’t remember.” The trial justice allowed the questioning to continue but noted counsel’s objection. Additionally, in yet another attempt to refresh the witness’s recollection, a tape recording of Smith’s testimony before the grand jury was played to the jury.</p>

    <p id="b1275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1275.7",1275,[154,1043,753,1019]]]'>The state next called John P. A’Vant (Det. A’Vant) from the state police, the detective who investigated this case. Detective A’Vant testified that he tape-recorded the interview with Smith and that the transcript of that interview consisted of 367 questions and fifty pages of transcript. The state sought to have the transcript of the interview introduced as a prior recorded recollection, under Rule 803(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Although defendant objected, he did so on the ground that the document had not been authenticated and was neither signed nor witnessed. Defense counsel further argued that the prosecutor essentially had read the entire statement into the record through his use of leading questions to Smith. The trial justice allowed it and explained:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1275-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1275.8",1275,[192,2079,712,401]],["BL_1275.9",1275,[996,248,711,242]]]'>“ * * * I think [the jury has] had the benefit of observing Mr. Smith, they observed the fact that his memory was obviously very poor from what he said and he never denied that he made those statements. As a matter of fact, I think [the prosecutor] followed each one of those questions up with something like, ‘Although you don’t recall making these statements, you do not deny that you made them,’ words to that effect. And he said, ‘oh, yes.’ He agreed that he must have made the statements.”</blockquote>

The defendant first points to three instances of purported error during Smith’s testimony: the state’s use of leading questions; the introduction of Smith’s grand jury testimony; and error by the trial justice in allowing the transcript of Smith’s interview with the investigators to be introduced as a full exhibit. Next, defendant argues that the trial justice committed error when he allowed Det. A’Vant to testify because the state had failed to list him as a witness in its responses to the defendant’s discovery requests.</p>

Finally, defendant contends that his sentence violated both the state and federal constitutions as cruel and unusual punishment. However, as we consistently have held, this Court <a id="p1234" href="#p1234" data-label="1234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1234</a>“will only review those issues that have been properly preserved for appellate review.” <em>State v.

Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by permitting the state to introduce Smith’s grand jury testimony.

Although the witness purported to suffer from jail-house amnesia, a frequent malaise, this circumstance does not negate the underlying rationale for admissibility under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). In fact, this precisely is the reason for the rule: to allow for statements, such as Smith’s statement to the state police, to be introduced as substantive evidence in order for the fact finder to decide which statement, if any, is worthy of belief.

    <p id="b1278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1278.6",1278,[179,1181,747,1275]]]'>We next turn to defendant’s argument that the repeated use of leading questions to Smith on direct examination was so pervasive as to create prejudice in the eyes of the jury — an issue we perceive as problematic because of its duration and scope. We note that defense counsel was granted a continuing objection to the use of leading questions, as acknowledged by the trial justice on more than one occasion. Leading questions are questions that suggest the desired answer. <em>State v. Boillard, </em><a href="/a2d/789/0881-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="789 A.2d 881" data-case-ids="9402278" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0881-01">789 A.2d 881</a>, 887 (R.I.2002).

A party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner may resort to leading questions. It is within the discretion of the trial justice to decide whether to allow the examiner to lead; that discretion, however, is not without limit. <em>See State v. Merced, </em><a href="/citations/?q=938%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="938 A.2d 172">938 A.2d 172</a>, 176 (R.I.2007) (“As our discussion above makes abundantly clear, this scenario is well within the range of those in which a trial justice has discretion to permit the use of leading questions on direct examination.”).</p>
    <p id="b1278-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1278.9",1278,[970,1043,757,1432]]]'>However, we are not convinced that the extensive use of leading questions in this case was appropriate based on the length of the examination, and we note that the colloquy between the prosecutor and Smith came dangerously close to a prejudicial abuse of discretion by the trial justice. But we decline to declare it reversible error. Although a trial justice is vested with discretion to decide whether a witness is hostile and, if so, to allow the use of leading questions, the trial justice declared that he was “prepared to stay here all day” while the state posed leading questions to the witness who continued to profess a complete failure of memory. Defense counsel made his objection clear when he said, “I think [the prosecutor’s] continuing line of questioning is fruitless * * * and I think that’s having a prejudicial effect on the jury.” It is evident that the trial justice should have stopped the inquiry when it became obvious that the witness would persist in denying any memory of the events on trial. However, in light of our decision upholding the introduction of Smith’s statement to the police, we deem this harmless error.</p>

As such, it <a id="p1237" href="#p1237" data-label="1237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1237</a>was for the jury to decide whether the police statement was credible or whether Smith’s in-court testimony that he suffered a complete failure of memory was worthy of belief. Accordingly, Smith’s response to the prosecutor’s skillful and leading examination was highly probative on this point. Although we are of the opinion that the use of leading questions was excessive and should have been brought to a conclusion by the trial justice, we are not convinced that he committed reversible error in refusing to do so.</p>

Toward the end of the witness’s direct examination, the prosecutor attempted to refresh Smith’s recollection, yet again, by offering to play a recording of Smith’s testimony before the grand jury. Although defense counsel initially objected and a recorded conference was held outside the presence of the jury, the only objection defendant made was to the secrecy of the grand jury as provided by Rule 6 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On appeal, however, defendant argues that introducing Smith’s grand jury testimony violated his rights under both the state and federal constitutions. According to our well settled “raise or waive” rule, if an issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal. <em>State v. Pacheco, </em><a href="/a2d/763/0971-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="763 A.2d 971" data-case-ids="11175393" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0971-01">763 A.2d 971</a>, 976 (R.I.2001); <em>State v.

That precisely is what occurred in this case when Det. A’Vant testified at trial. <em>See State v.

The record discloses that Det. A’Vant was called to the stand to testify about Smith’s interview and the numerous disclosures he made to the state police, all of which had been made available to defendant before trial. This is not a case of unfair surprise, and there was no showing of bad faith on the part of the prosecutor. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in allowing Det.
