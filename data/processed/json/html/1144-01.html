Because of his inability to perform the responsibilities associated with this position, Claimant was demoted by Employer and was offered a job as a House Manager Aide or as a Developmental Care Specialist. Although the offered positions had the same hours as the Assistant House Manager position, they paid only $6.76 per hour. For this reason, Claimant refused Employer’s offer and terminated his employment. Claimant then applied for benefits with the Office of Employment Security, which found that Claimant had voluntarily terminated his employment for a necessitous and compelling reason and awarded him benefits. Employer appealed, and several hearings were held before the Referee.</p>

Claimant further testified that he had refused employment in those positions because they offered significantly less compensation than the Assistant House Manager position.

As examples of some of the reasons for which Claimant was demoted, Employer’s witnesses stated that he reacted to situations hastily, repeatedly failed to follow the established chain of command when presenting <a id="p1146" href="#p1146" data-label="1146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1146</a>Employer with problems, failed to timely complete his required documentation, failed to keep accurate records with respect to the residents, failed to apply and disregarded Employer’s policies with respect to the residents, and breached the residents’ confidentiality.
