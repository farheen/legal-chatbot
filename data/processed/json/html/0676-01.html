On appeal, the defendant contends: (1) that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that he violated his probation, and (2) that the hearing justice did not afford him his right of allocution. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 30, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we shall decide the appeal at this time.

On October 18, 2006, less than three and a half weeks after his plea, defendant was arrested and charged with violating the no-contact order and with one count of simple assault and battery in violation of G.L.1956 § 11-5-8. Because of the new charges, the state filed a notice of violation pursuant to Rule 82(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, alleging that defendant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A probation-revocation hearing was held on November 8, 2006, in the Superior Court.</p>

Hargrow testified that defendant staggered and smelled strongly of alcohol and that he approached her and began to verbally accost her. Hargrow informed defendant that she was gathering his belongings from their mother’s home so that he could return with a police officer to retrieve them, as had earlier been arranged with their mother, Ba-tey. Hargrow testified that defendant got very close to her, and she was “kind of scared, like he was going to hit me,” even though she was confident that he would never strike her.</p>

Herrmann said that he told defendant, “if you do that again, I’m knocking you out.” As Herrmann walked away, Hargrow told him that the police were on their way and that he needed to speak to them, which Herrmann agreed to do.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

He admitted that he saw his sister, but he said that they had run into each other earlier in the day and that she asked him what he wanted her to do with the clothes that remained at their mother’s home. He said that he told her that he would collect them on Saturday with a police officer. He testified that he often walked along his mother’s street during the course of his day, but because of the no-contact order, he confined himself to the side of the street opposite her house. He submitted that he was doing just that when Hargrow came outside the home and again asked him where he wanted his clothes delivered. <a id="p679" href="#p679" data-label="679" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*679</a>He testified that he told her to deliver them to a location where he maintained storage space, and that he continued walking down the street.

The court found Herrmann to be credible, despite his significant criminal record, because his testimony supported that of Hargrow and Ba-tey, both of whom the court also found credible. In rendering his decision, the hearing justice found that defendant assaulted Herrmann, verbally harassed Har-grow, and deliberately appeared at Batey’s home to have “some type of interchange with his mother or family,” in violation of the no-contact order. Consequently, the court found that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his probation. The hearing justice removed the suspended sentence and ordered defendant to serve one year imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions.

I find that he did in fact assault Scott Herrmann by shoving him backwards because Mr. Herrmann was, on this occasion, at least doing the gentlemanly thing by attempting to stop and prevent harassment of two women by an uncontrolled individual, that is, the defendant. So I find the defendant is a violator. I only regret that there is but one year to utilize as punishment for Mr. Jones. As he is well aware, this Court was sympathetic to some of his health issues, some of the travel of his life, and I believe that there is but a single year that I can give to Mr. Jones as a penalty.</blockquote>
