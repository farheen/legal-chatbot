Petitioner appealed. Before the Superior Court, Petitioner’s court-appointed counsel requested leave to withdraw per <em>Anders v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">386 U.S. 738</a>, <a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">87 S.Ct. 1396</a>, <a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">18 L.Ed.2d 493</a> (1967) and filed an <em>Anders </em>brief. The Superior Court determined that the appeal was frivolous, granted counsel leave to withdraw, and affirmed the orders of the trial court. <em>See </em>1494 and 1495 MDA 2007 (order dated 6/02/2008).</p>

    <p id="b1201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1201.6",1201,[142,592,755,1036]]]'>Appointed counsel who has complied with <em>Anders </em>and is permitted to withdraw discharges the direct appeal obligations of counsel. Once counsel is granted leave to withdraw per <em>Anders, </em>a necessary consequence of that decision is that the right to appointed counsel is at an end. Appointing new counsel would be in conflict with the purpose of <em>Anders </em>which is to balance the constitutional rights to appeal and to counsel on appeal against the prohibition against frivolous appeals. Furthermore, Rule 122 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure does not provide that subsequent counsel should be appointed in the wake of the Superior Court granting counsel leave to withdraw per <em>Anders. </em>Accordingly, as Petitioner is not entitled to appointment of subsequent counsel following the Superior Court granting his counsel leave to withdraw, under <em>Anders, </em>we deny this Motion.</p>
