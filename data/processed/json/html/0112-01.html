We agree with the Thi-beaults’ contention, and accordingly, we vacate the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b169-15" data-blocks='[["BL_169.14",169,[197,2652,749,85]],["BL_169.15",169,[1000,233,750,230]]]'>Following the Thibeaults’ filing of a notice of claim for professional negligence against Larson pursuant to 24 M.R.S.A. § 2903 (1990 &amp; Supp.1994) on April 6,1993, Larson filed a motion to dismiss the claim pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted.</p>
    <p id="b169-18" data-blocks='[["BL_169.16",169,[997,493,751,659]]]'>The allegations set forth in the claim of the Thibeaults can be summarized as follows: On March 5, 1990, Larson, a doctor of osteopathy practicing in obstetrics and gynecology, determined that Sally Thibeault was nine weeks pregnant. Because Sally was 36 years of age at the time, Larson discussed with her the risk factors associated with her pregnancy, and she agreed to undergo an amniocentesis to determine the presence of any genetic disability of the fetus. The Thibeaults were prepared to have Sally abort the fetus if the procedure revealed a genetic disability of the fetus, such as Down’s Syndrome.</p>
    <p id="b169-19" data-blocks='[["BL_169.17",169,[993,1183,753,800]]]'>On April 24, 1990 when Sally was sixteen weeks pregnant, she underwent an ultrasound study of the fetus with the expectation that the amniocentesis would be performed at that time. Because the study revealed the placenta was in an anterior position, Larson determined not to proceed with the amniocentesis. A second attempt was made on May 2, 1990, in the eighteenth week of Sally’s pregnancy, but abandoned by Larson when the ultrasound revealed the placenta was once again in an anterior position. Larson informed Sally that it would be too risky to attempt the amniocentesis procedure a third time. Relying on Larson’s superior knowledge, the Thibeaults did not request a further attempt to perform the procedure.</p>
    <p id="b169-20" data-blocks='[["BL_169.18",169,[993,2013,751,561]]]'>The Thibeaults also allege that in 1990, physicians routinely performed amniocentesis through the placenta and that Larson negligently managed Sally’s pregnancy by not performing amniocentesis through the placenta on April 24 or May 2, 1990. Because he did not refer her to another physician <em>for </em>the procedure if he felt he could not do it himself, the Thibeaults were not made aware of the genetic defect present in their unborn child in time for a decision to terminate the pregnancy.</p>

As a result, the Thibeaults have incurred expenses in excess of $130,000 for the numerous medical procedures Eric has undergone and will continue to incur expenses for his medical treatment and specialized care.</p>

From the judgment entered accordingly, the Thibeaults appeal.</p>

We examine the claim in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs to determine whether it alleges the elements of a cause of action against the defendant or alleges facts that could entitle the plaintiffs to relief pursuant to some legal theory. <em>Larrabee v.

Slip op. at 5-6. An examination of subsection 3 in the framework of the whole section leads to quite a different meaning. As the Court states, subsections 1 and 2 codify our decision in <em>Macomber v. Dillman, </em><a href="/a2d/505/0810-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="505 A.2d 810" data-case-ids="7913427" data-case-paths="/a2d/505/0810-01">505 A.2d 810</a> (Me.1986), that limited the damages recoverable for a failed sterilization that results in <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>the birth of a healthy child. Subsection 3 then covers a circumstance not present in <em>Macomber, </em>i.e., the birth of an unhealthy child. Although I agree that the statute does not require that the disease, defect, or handicap suffered by the child be caused by professional negligence, it does require that the child be born as a result of the professional negligence. <em>See </em>24 M.R.S.A. § 2502(7) (1990) (defining professional negligence as misconduct that “proximately caused the injury complained of’). The case before us does not present an example of causation in the same sense that a failed sterilization can be said to <em>cause </em>a child to be born. At most, the failure to perform an amniocentesis may deprive a woman of the opportunity to consider aborting her pregnancy and prevent the birth of a child. It is the loss of that opportunity of which the Thibeaults complain.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[220,1221,752,1107]]]'>Moreover, negligence that results in a lost opportunity is dealt with in subsection 4. There the Legislature provided that the professional negligence is actionable if the negligence precludes any prevention, cure, or amelioration of a condition prior to birth. In other words, the injury complained of is the loss of opportunity to prevent, cure, or ameliorate a condition prior to birth. Thus Larson’s omission of an amniocentesis that would have disclosed the genetic defect in time to abort Sally’s pregnancy precluded the choice of measures to prevent the condition prior to birth. Unfortunately for the Thibeaults, however, the final clause of subsection 4 excludes any manner of prevention that does not preserve the health and life of the child. That final clause does not undermine a woman’s right to choose' an abortion. Rather it reflects the Legislature’s judgment that a court ought not be required “to determine the difference in value between nonlife and life with defects” L.D. 2400, Statement of Fact (112th Legis.1986).</p>
