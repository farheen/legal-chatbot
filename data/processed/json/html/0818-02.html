    <p id="p-9"><a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>This appeal arises out of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, sitting as a juvenile court, finding that David P. ("David") was involved in attempted first-degree arson and reckless endangerment. At a subsequent disposition hearing, David was placed in the custody of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services ("department") and sent to an out-of-state facility for detention.</p>
    <p id="p-10">David now appeals, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence as to both findings of involvement.</p>
    <p id="p-11"><strong>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</strong></p>
    <p id="p-12">We have reworded David's questions for clarity, as follows:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a></p>
    <blockquote id="p-13">I. Was the evidence sufficient to support the juvenile court's finding of David's involvement in attempted arson?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-14">II. Was the evidence sufficient to support the juvenile court's finding of David's involvement in reckless endangerment?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-15"><a id="p821" href="#p821" data-label="821" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*821</a>III. Did the juvenile court err in denying the motion to suppress an out of court identification?</blockquote>
    <p id="p-16">For the reasons stated below, we answer the first two questions in the negative. Accordingly, we vacate David's convictions, and we do not reach the third question.</p>
    <p id="p-17"><strong>FACTS</strong></p>
    <p id="p-18">Nuzhat Nada provided testimony as to the following facts.</p>
    <p id="p-19"><a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>On March 21, 2016, Nada was at her residence at 205 Walnut Street, Salisbury, in Wicomico County. At 7:00 p.m. on that evening, Nada heard a noise at her door and walked over to open it. No one was standing at the doorway, but she observed a person running away. Nada later heard the noise a second time, and again opened the door to find no one there. She then stood by the door, waiting to hear the noise again. When the noise started for a third time, she immediately opened her door and saw David running from her doorstep, looking backwards over his shoulder. Nada then followed David to his house, at 121 Chestnut Street, with the intention of informing his mother about what had happened. However, Nada returned home without speaking to anyone at David's house.</p>
    <p id="p-20">A few minutes after returning home, Nada heard a noise at her door again. She opened the door to again see someone running away, and she saw two matches burning on the bricks in front of her door. Nada explained that the matches were about "one and a half feet away from the door," and that she has "a lot of wood and cones" on her other porch.</p>
    <p id="p-21">Nada then called the police. She testified that while waiting for the police, she stood by the matches and let them burn because she "didn't want to touch them." She testified that she did not extinguish the matches, but watched to make sure they did not fly off, fearing that the matches could ignite dry leaves at the side of the house "because of the wind." Nada testified that the matches left scorch marks "on the bricks" in front of the home and that she had photos of the marks. No such photos were offered as evidence.</p>
    <p id="p-22">The police arrived and Nada conveyed her account of what had happened. An officer took Nada to 121 Chestnut for a show-up identification. Beforehand, neighborhood residents spoke with Nada about their own experiences with David.</p>
    <p id="p-23">Officer Brian Weglarz testified next for the State. He confirmed responding to a call at 205 Walnut Street and meeting with Nada at her residence. Weglarz further testified that he observed "two extinguished matches" in front of the <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>home on a concrete area attached to the front door. Weglarz described the matches as "about two inches in length, the cut that you would find out of a match book." On cross examination, Weglarz answered affirmatively when asked if Nada had extinguished the matches by stepping on them, and he also answered affirmatively when asked if Nada "had to actually extinguish" the matches. Weglarz further testified that he did not see scorch or burn marks on the porch. Finally, Officer Carroll testified for the State and provided testimony regarding the circumstances of the show-up identification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The above was the extent of the evidence actually presented at trial.</p>
    <p id="p-24"><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p>
    <p id="p-25">The Court of Appeals has remarked: "In a juvenile delinquency matter, an appellate <a id="p822" href="#p822" data-label="822" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*822</a>court will 'review the case on both the law and the evidence.'

    <p id="p-30">The juvenile court, as the finder of fact, "possesses the ability to choose among differing inferences that might possibly be made from a factual situation and [the appellate court] must give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws." <em>In re Landon G.,</em> <a href="/md-app/214/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="214 Md.

    <p id="p-32"><strong>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence-Attempted Arson</strong></p>
    <p id="p-33">David avers that the State failed to meet its burden for the charge of attempted arson, because it failed to prove the requisite <em>mens rea</em> for attempted first-degree arson-a specific <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>intent crime. <em>Holbrook v.

    <p id="p-34">The crime of first-degree arson is set out by statute:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-35">(a) A person may not willfully and maliciously set fire to or burn:</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-36">(1) a dwelling; or</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-37">(2) a structure in or on which an individual who is not a participant is present.</blockquote>

No arson takes place where "the fire is not communicated to any part of the structure itself." <em>Hines v. State,</em> <a href="/md-app/34/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="34 Md.

    <p id="p-41">Both parties agree that arson is a specific intent crime. "A specific intent is not simply the intent to do the immediate act but embraces the requirement that the mind be conscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act." <em>Smith v.

This is the case because the General Assembly repealed the arson statute in 1993, one year after <em>Richmond,</em> and enacted new definitional provisions defining "willfully" and "maliciously." <em><a href="/md/364/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="364 Md. 354" data-case-ids="1279889" data-case-paths="/md/364/0354-01">Id.</a></em> "Maliciously" is defined as "acting with intent to harm a person or property," CL ยง 6-101(c), and "willfully," is defined as "acting intentionally, knowingly, and purposely." <em><a href="/md/364/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="364 Md. 354" data-case-ids="1279889" data-case-paths="/md/364/0354-01">Id.</a></em> ยง 6-101(e).

    <p id="p-43">The State interprets the statutory change and <em>Holbrook</em> to require specific intent to do harm, but not more than reckless or wanton disregard for the consequences. The State posits that a person may be convicted where specific intent is found as to the conduct-<em>i.e.</em> , the lighting of a match, but mere recklessness is found as to the consequences that follow-<em>i.e.</em> , the burning of the building.</p>
    <p id="p-44">We find no merit in this position, as it ignores the concept of a specific intent crime as one in which the party has not only the "intent to do the immediate act" but where his mind is also "conscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act." <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/md-app/41/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="41 Md.

    <p id="p-48">As discussed <em>supra</em> , arson is a specific intent crime, and because an attempt to commit a specific intent crime requires the same ultimate specific intent as the consummated crime, the exact question before us is whether the evidence sufficed to prove that David had the specific intent to willfully and maliciously set fire to Nada's home. "Since intent is subjective and, without the cooperation of the accused, cannot be directly and objectively proven, its presence must be shown by established facts which permit a proper inference of its existence." <em>Spencer,</em> <a href="/md/450/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="450 Md. 530" data-case-ids="12178204,12488016" data-case-paths="/md/450/0530-01,/a3d/149-2/0610-01">450 Md. at 568</a>, <a href="/md/450/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="450 Md. 530" data-case-ids="12178204,12488016" data-case-paths="/md/450/0530-01,/a3d/149-2/0610-01">149 A.3d 610</a> (citation and quotations omitted). Accordingly, our evaluation focuses on the circumstances surrounding David's actions, and the action itself, although we are looking to the actions to understand the actor's intent-not to evaluate the actions for sufficiency of the <em>actus reus</em> .</p>
    <p id="p-49">David states that, "[t]wo matchbook matches dropped on the flame-retardant <a id="p825" href="#p825" data-label="825" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*825</a>landing in front of a home cannot constitute an overt act evincing specific intent to commit arson."</p>
    <p id="p-50">The facts again are as follows. After thrice causing a ruckus on her porch that brought Nada out of her home, David lit two matches and dropped them on the bricks of Nada's front stoop, about one and a half feet away from her door. He then ran away. A wicker doormat was nearby, and there were quantities of dry leaves around the side of the house. Nada also had "a lot of wood and cones" on her other porch.</p>
    <p id="p-51">Although ample case law illustrates conduct that satisfies the elements and constitutes an attempted arson, very little case law illustrates conduct that does not rise to required level. We look to both Maryland and our sister states for guidance.</p>
    <p id="p-52">In <em>Maner v. State,</em> <a href="/ga-app/43/0772-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="43 Ga.

The Court concluded that an attempted arson occurred, where "reasonable construction of the acts alleged ... force one to the conclusion that such acts were committed for no purpose other than to set fire to the building, and thereby commit arson." <em><a href="/citations/?q=159%20S.E.%20902" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="159 S.E. 902">Id.</a></em><a href="/citations/?q=159%20S.E.%20902" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="159 S.E. 902"> at 903</a>.</p>
    <p id="p-53">The presence of an accelerant is a common characteristic in convictions for arson. <em>See</em> <em>State of Missouri v. Ailshire,</em> <a href="/sw2d/664/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="664 S.W.2d 630" data-case-ids="11757271" data-case-paths="/sw2d/664/0630-01">664 S.W.2d 630</a>, 633 (Mo. Ct. App. 1984) ("The presence of gasoline splashed on the basement walls, gasoline vapors in the stairwell, and a fire burning on the bottom three steps, in close proximity to the basement door, constituted a 'substantial step' towards the commission of the offense of arson."). The use of an accelerant allows a reasonable inference of intent, because it forces one to the conclusion that the actor was intending to set fire to a building, as there is no other rational purpose for conduct such as splashing gasoline on building walls.</p>
    <p id="p-54">Here, the State points to the "wicker mat nearby" where David "dropped two lit matches" as evidence to support the finding of involvement. The State avers that David's " 'overt act' of lighting the matches, coupled with the fact that he dropped them where he did, constituted a 'substantial step' towards the arson." The State seemingly asks that we infer the required intent from these actions. We agree that where David put the matches is relevant, but unlike the State, we believe that where he put the matches cuts <em>against</em> a finding of a malicious or willful intent to burning the dwelling. We explain.</p>
    <p id="p-55">Although flammable material was nearby, the matches were laid on an nonflammable material, and not on the wicker mat. Similarly, David could have easily collected the nearby pinecones or dry leaves to create an accelerant, but he did not do so. Where he laid the matches supports the conclusion that David was a juvenile playing with matches, not that he lit the match intending to set a fire. If an adult struck a match and threw it into an empty brick fireplace, we would not say that <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>person was building a fire. Rather, to show intent to build a fire, we would understand that the person must first gather logs and sticks, arrange them, and only then<em>,</em> strike and lay the match. The mere striking and laying of a match on an nonflammable surface alone does not show intent to start a fire.</p>
    <p id="p-56">Further, the intent requirement is that David intended to set a fire to cause harm. Because of his prior behavior, Nada immediately went onto the porch as soon as she heard noise again-so quickly that she saw the matches still burning. David's behavior essentially put Nada on notice that mischief was occurring, allowing her to immediately <a id="p826" href="#p826" data-label="826" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*826</a>respond to his subsequent actions, and thereby negating any remote chance that may have existed that the matches may have ignited nearby materials. This evidence is not a basis by which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that David did have an intent to harm, which is the State's burden and which was not met in this case.</p>
    <p id="p-57">The State seems to ask us to affirm that David acted with specific intent, because he took a substantial step by laying the matches near the mat, and that his actions fell short of completion because the wind did not blow in such a way to carry the lit matches to the mat, while also blowing in such a way to not extinguish the matches, all before Nada came to the porch, despite her previous appearances. This theory of the case requires an external, uncontrollable, factor to intervene in order for the crime to reach fruition and therefore, undercuts the finding of specific intent.</p>
    <p id="p-58">Rather than viewing his actions as circumstances from which we can infer intent to maliciously set fire to her home, we instead infer a lack of specific intent to start a fire in order to burn the building or to cause harm to Nada herself. A "reasonable construction of the acts alleged" allows one to conclude that David was a reckless juvenile playing with matches, rather than facts which "force one to the conclusion that such acts were committed for no purpose other than to set fire to the building." <em>Maner,</em> <a href="/citations/?q=159%20S.E.%20902" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="159 S.E. 902">159 S.E. at 902-03</a>. To allow a <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>finding of involvement on these facts would allow a conviction for attempted first-degree arson every time that a person intentionally drops a still-burning cigarette butt on a sidewalk that happens to be feet away from a building where there are nearby leaves. This position completely ignores the requirement of intending to cause harm or acting purposefully or knowingly, and it expands the bounds of arson far beyond its original constraints.</p>
    <p id="p-59">For this reason and those discussed above, we conclude that the State failed to prove that David acted willfully or maliciously with an intent to burn the dwelling, and that no rational trier of fact could have found this essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Elrich S.,</em> <a href="/md/416/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="416 Md. 15" data-case-ids="3695397" data-case-paths="/md/416/0015-01">416 Md. at 30</a>, <a href="/md/416/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="416 Md. 15" data-case-ids="3695397" data-case-paths="/md/416/0015-01">5 A.3d 27</a>.</p>
    <p id="p-60"><strong>II. Sufficiency of the Evidence-Reckless Endangerment</strong></p>

    <p id="p-68">Much of the related case law in Maryland addresses situations where a party has recklessly brandished a firearm. Although not directly on point, the discussion and standards set by these cases do inform what types of conduct create a substantial risk.</p>
    <p id="p-69">To sustain a conviction for reckless endangerment in the case of a firearm, it is necessary to establish that the firearm was operable. <em>Moulden</em> , <a href="/md-app/212/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="212 Md.

    <p id="p-70">To analogize the risk of harm from a match to a gun, David asks that we view the risk from the two lit matches as analogous to the situation in <em>Perry</em> where "shooting a pistol into the air or in the general direction of a roadway but considerably short" was found to be insufficient to be considered a substantial risk. <a href="/a3d/146-2/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="229 Md.

As David identifies, force was created, but not related in any meaningful way towards a person. Because the matches were so overwhelmingly likely to burn themselves out on the nonflammable surface, as they did, they created no appreciable risk of spreading harm to the house, much less the person inside.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a></p>
    <p id="p-71">David also points us to a similar case from our sister state of New York, where the New York appellate court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-72">Here, respondent lit a match, set the corner of a piece of paper on fire, and then dropped the piece of paper on the floor and stamped out the fire. The auditorium in which he was located had no carpeting, and no other students were in proximity to him.

    <p id="p-74">The State again points to Nada's presence watching over the matches as a relevant fact of why the fire did not spread and asserts that the fire could have spread and caused Nada injury, but for her presence to prevent such harm. However, <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>this argument once again ignores that Nada was immediately on the porch to watch or put out the matches, because she was on notice of David's misbehavior because of his own, immediately prior actions and mischief on her porch just moments prior.</p>
    <p id="p-75">We agree with David that the likelihood that the matches would ignite the home and cause injury to Nada cannot be described as a "substantial risk." The juvenile court noted that the lit matches "potentially could have resulted in the house catching on fire and harm to both the house, and potentially, to Ms. Nada in this case." While the juvenile court is correct that these outcomes <em>potentially could have</em> occurred, that outcome is again reliant on an uncontrollable, external factor of the wind carrying the matches in such a way so as to keep them lit while blowing them to a combustible material, and ignores the aspects of his conduct that mitigated whatever very remote chance did exist. We cannot agree that the possibility of such an occurrence was likely enough for any rational trier of fact to conclude that it constituted a "substantial risk."</p>
    <p id="p-76">The record does not disclose what motivated David to harass his neighbor. Certainly, a reasonable person in Nada's position could have perceived the implicit threat in David's behavior, namely that lit matches could just as easily be placed on flammable material. David's conduct might have been the basis for a finding of involvement with the criminal harassment, CL ยง 3-803,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> but that is not the way that he was <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>charged. For this reason, we reverse the juvenile court's finding of David's involvement with reckless endangerment.</p>
    <p id="p-77">Because we reverse both findings of David's involvement, we need not address the merits of the third question regarding the suppression of the show-up identification.</p>
