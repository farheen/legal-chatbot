    <p id="b546-17" data-blocks='[["BL_546.17",546,[984,389,755,1168]]]'>The defendant is a 15-year-old female charged with Attempted Murder 1st, Robbery 1st, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, and Conspiracy 1st. On April 12, 2007, the Court conducted a Suppression Hearing wherein the defendant argued that her statement given to the police was inadmissible because she had not waived her <em>Miranda </em>Rights. After denying the Motion to Suppress, the case proceeded to trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the Court announced on the record its findings, and basis thereof, that the defendant was guilty of Robbery 1st, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, and Conspiracy 2nd. The Court reserved its decision on the charge of Attempted Murder 1st, and requested memoranda from the attorneys regarding that charge and also whether the facts might lead to a finding of guilt of a lesser included offense of Attempted Murder 2nd.</p>
    <p id="b546-18" data-blocks='[["BL_546.18",546,[981,1590,753,1073]],["BL_547.1",547,[165,252,752,241]]]'>Based upon the testimony provided, including the defendant’s statement which was allowed into evidence, the Court found that on the evening of November 24, 2006, the 15-year-old female defendant contacted the 32-year-old male victim around 6:00 p.m. stating that she was hungry, wanted something to eat, and requesting that he come and get her. The defendant instructed the victim to meet her at the Coverdale Crossroads playground. While the defendant and the victim were sitting in victim’s car at the Coverdale Crossroads playground, the defendant reached over and took the keys to turn off the car. At about that time, two men wearing masks appeared on either side of the car. One of the masked gentlemen demanded the victim’s money while holding a gun to the victim’s head. The armed robber then fired a few shots from close range at the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>victim. Although the shots penetrated the victim’s clothing, amazingly, the victim was not harmed. The two masked gentlemen, as well as the 15-year-old defendant, then fled the scene.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[166,527,755,1697]]]'>Based upon the testimony of the various witnesses as well as the defendant’s statement, the Court concluded that this 15-year-old female defendant had agreed with the shooter prior to the incident to arrange for the victim to be present at the robbery location. Furthermore, the Court concluded that the defendant knew that the shooter planned to rob the victim, that the shooter would be armed, and that the shooter might pistol whip the victim with the handgun. There was no proof in the record that the defendant had any knowledge of the shooter’s intent to fire shots from close range at the victim. Furthermore, at no time during the actual robbery did the defendant threaten the victim, rob him or shoot at him. However, the Court was convinced that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, under title 11, section 271(2)(b) of the <em>Delaware Code, </em>intended to promote and facilitate the commission of the crimes of Robbery 1st, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, and Conspiracy 2nd, by aiding and agreeing to assist the shooter in the planning or commission of the crimes, and committed an overt act in the furtherance of those crimes by making the victim available at the place of the co-defendant’s choosing and shutting down the vehicle so that the victim could not flee.</p>

The defendant alleged that the police obtained her statement in violation of her 5th Amendment rights in having failed to obtain a verbal or written waiver of her 5th Amendment <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>
    <p id="b547-9" data-blocks='[["BL_547.8",547,[965,369,756,555]]]'>The defendant was brought to the Delaware State Police Station around noon on November 28, 2006, by her guardian grandmother and her aunt. Prior to the interview, the detective informed the aunt and grandmother that only one of them would be permitted along with the defendant in the Interview Room. It was agreed between grandmother and aunt that the aunt would accompany the defendant into the Interview Room.</p>

    <p id="b547-11" data-blocks='[["BL_547.10",547,[968,1234,752,92]]]'>At the outset of the interview, the detective stated the following:</p>

You have the right to have an attorney present while you are being questioned. If you can’t afford to hire an attorney, one will be appointed to represent you if you wish one. If you decide to answer any questions "with or without an attorney present, you may stop at any time during the questioning. Okay, do you guys, the both of you, do you understand your rights? Okay, and having these rights in mind, okay, do you wish to talk?”</blockquote>

    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[182,368,757,1079]]]'>Thus, there is the issue of whether the detective’s uncertainty in receiving an audible response from the defendant resulted in an appropriate waiver of the defendant’s <em>Miranda </em>Rights. The Court also noted that the detective read the preceding <em>Miranda </em>Warnings in a very quickly spoken manner, and certainly more quickly than the other questions were asked in the interview. Given that the consequence of failing to properly advise a defendant on <em>Miranda </em>could mean the suppression of a defendant’s incriminating statement, and that inclusion or exclusion of the statement can often mean the difference between a finding of guilt or innocence, the Court would think that police officers who conduct such interviews would be well advised to take appropriate time and give appropriate emphasis in reciting the <em>Miranda </em>Warnings.</p>

Thus, in this case, the totality of the circumstances mandates inquiry into the age of the child, the child’s experience, education, background, intelligence, as well as inquiry into whether she has the capacity to understand the warnings offered to her, the nature of her 5th Amendment Rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> The <em>Fare </em>decision noted that it was not imposing restraints on the Court and law enforcements officers in dealing with experienced older juveniles who, knowing and intelligently waive their 5th Amendment Rights and voluntarily consent to interrogation.</p>

The police officer read the <em>Miranda </em>Warnings, and he received a verbal acknowledgment of understanding from either the defendant or her aunt. The police officer added an additional caution to remind them that they could stop if they did not feel comfortable answering the question. The defendant participated in the interview by answering questions. There was no suggestion that the defendant had a hearing problem. Even if the Court was concerned that the police officer’s initial reading of the <em>Miranda </em>Warnings was made very quickly, the detective’s words were understandable. Furthermore, the testimony from Michellin E. Stokes, the child’s probation officer under a reciprocal agreement from the State of Maryland, demonstrated that this juvenile had extensive past experience with arrests in the criminal system during 2005 as well as early 2006. The probation officer testified that the defendant was “anything but limited” and not intimidated by adult figures. The defendant’s Principal at the Middle School she attends testified that the defendant is not intimidated by adults, is a regular education student, and is very worldly and very street smart.</p>
    <p id="b549-9" data-blocks='[["BL_549.7",549,[964,849,756,769]]]'>Given all of the above, the Court found that the officer’s interrogation was appropriate and free from any overreaching and the defendant cooperated in the interview. The Court further found that, even though the defendant is only 15 years of age, she is street smart and intelligent, and that she has had considerable experience with the legal system so that she would have had previous experiences in <em>Miranda </em>Warnings. Based upon all of this, the Court found the defendant’s waiver to be voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently given, and, therefore, denied the defendant’s motion to suppress her statement.</p>

It was also clear to the Court that the juvenile defendant knew that her co-defendant would be carrying a gun with the possibility that the co-defendant would pistol whip the victim. In such a case, this Court is of the opinion that it was reasonable to foresee, where a gun is involved, that shots could be fired during the robbery. In this case, shots were not only <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>fired during the robbery, but they were fired at close range at the victim.
