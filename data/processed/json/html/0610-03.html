They had one child during the marriage, a daughter, who was bom in 1985. Following the separation, the court entered a consent order that granted the parties’ shared legal custody of the child. Mother retained primary physical custody of the child and Father was given partial custody every other weekend, every Tuesday evening, every other Thursday evening, shared holiday visitations and three weeks of summer vacation.</p>

On April 14, 1997, Mother received a letter from Mount Aloysius College confirming that her teaching contract would not be renewed. In the interim, Mother learned of opportunities available to teach near her sister in South Carolina. As a result, Mother actively sought a teaching position in that area and, in May 1997, she received a job offer from Midlands Technical College in Columbia, South Carolina. At no time, however, did Mother seek employment within Pennsylvania.</p>

Despite the fact that [the child] would prefer to stay in Indiana to be near both of her parents, the Petitioner made no attempt to remain in Pennsylvania. Rather, the Petitioner decided to go to South Carolina to cope with her divorce. To allow the Petitioner to take [the child] to South Carolina at this time could very well thwart the development of a healthy relationship between [the child] and her father.</blockquote>

Conversely, the trial court must be certain that the non-custodial parent is not resisting the desire of the custodial parent to relocate for reasons other than his/her genuine concern that such move will seriously jeopardize the sustainment or the development of a loving parent/child relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child.

It is true that in analyzing the first factor—the potential advantages of the proposed move for the improvement of the quality of life for the custodial parent—the trial court is not limited to considering the economic benefits of the relocation. It must also weigh the benefits of the existence and close proximity of family and friends of the custodial parent and an improvement of the physical environment for both the custodial parent and the child. Appellant testified that she and her daughter would be renting separate property on the premises of her sister and that her daughter would enjoy the company of her cousins, the young children of the sister. Instead, the trial court observed that the parties’ daughter had relatives in communities near Indiana with whom she could maintain a relationship. These relatives consist of a paternal grandmother and paternal cousins, appellant’s bachelor brother and appellant’s elderly aunt and uncle who resided part of the year in Florida.</p>

There, the mother desired to relocate to California with the minor child. This court affirmed the trial court’s decision to disallow the mother to move to California with the child. The mother averred that she desired to move to California to be with her family and to improve the quality of her life. She maintained that in California she would be able to obtain free day care for the child and that the move was economically necessary because the father had failed to pay child support. This court found that no evidence existed in the record of a support order. Additionally, the mother, who was employed in Pennsylvania as an assistant manager for Firestone, voluntarily left that position for a waitressing job at a local restaurant. Because of that, this court concluded that any financial hardship which the mother endured was self-imposed. The mother had no employment prospects in California and had failed to pursue employment prospects commensurate with her education and training<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> in Pittsburgh. Additionally, the child was being cared for free of charge by the father’s family. Therefore, the court gave no credence to her allegation that she was in need of free day care because of the father’s failure to pay child support. The court also found that the child was flourishing in the care of the father and his family and that the move would be detrimental to him. We determined from the record that the child had a positive on-going relationship with the father’s parents, grandparents and sister. Although we acknowledged that the child also maintained a good relationship with his maternal grandmother, aunt and uncle who resided in California, such was not a paramount consideration in light of the detrimental effect the move would have upon the child in his relationship with the father’s family.</p>

Additionally, she has close family ties in South Carolina and an offer of a place to reside with her daughter on the family property. By appellee’s own admission, his daughter does not maintain a close relationship with appellee’s family. It appears just as unlikely that she has closely bonded with appellant’s family as they are either elderly, do not reside consistently in the area or are adults with independent lifestyles. In South Carolina, appellant would have the companionship of her sister and the <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>latter’s family, and her daughter would have her cousins as playmates.

    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[197,440,754,1232]]]'>In <em>Gancas, </em>the trial court at least acknowledged that the mother’s motives for relocating were good and pure. In considering the second factor of Gruber—the motives of the respective parents in either seeking or preventing the relocation—its error consisted merely of concluding that, all other factors being equal, <em>i.e., </em>parental love and a desire to promote a caring relationship with the child, primary physical custody would rest with the father simply because the mother would be relocating outside Pennsylvania. In the matter at bar, however, the trial court questioned the motive behind appellant’s desire to move to South Carolina because appellant did not seek employment within this Commonwealth. Therefore, and primarily for this reason, the trial court held that appellant could not move to South Carolina and still retain primary physical custody of her daughter. The trial court’s ruling is tantamount to punishing appellant for failing to seek employment in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, even though such employment was not commensurate in quality and quantity with that previously held by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[197,1694,754,804]]]'>A court cannot condition a custodial parent’s primary custody of a child upon the requirement that the parent limit his/her employment opportunities to a particular locale if the best interests of the child demand otherwise. “In terms of the best interests of the child the primary physical custody family must be viewed as the family central and most important to the child’s best interests.” <em><a href="/a2d/650/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="650 A.2d 110" data-case-ids="11312821,707283" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0110-01,/pa-super/437/0446-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/650/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="650 A.2d 110" data-case-ids="11312821,707283" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0110-01,/pa-super/437/0446-01">at 179</a>, <a href="/pa-super/400/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="400 Pa.

The trial court concluded that appellant would not comply with any visitation schedule if she were to relocate to South Carolina as the primary custodian of her daughter.
