Lethal Exterminator, Inc., supra; Johnson v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/707/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="707 A.2d 237" data-case-ids="11853026" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0237-01">707 A.2d 237</a> (Pa.Super.1997). As stated above, whether a plaintiff will be inconvenienced by her own choice of forum is not a significant factor justifying a transfer, since it intrudes upon the right of a plaintiff to choose his or her forum. <em>See: Scola v. AC &amp; S, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/540/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="540 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="472149" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0353-01">540 Pa. 353</a>, <a href="/a2d/657/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="657 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="11944732,472149" data-case-paths="/a2d/657/1234-01,/pa/540/0353-01">657 A.2d 1234</a> (1995). Thus, given that the law affords plaintiff a choice of where to file suit,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> we can take judicial notice of the fact that appellant considered her own convenience prior to choosing her forum, and courts should not lightly abrogate that choice. <em>See: Catagnus v. Allstate Insurance Co., supra, </em><a href="/a2d/864/1259-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="864 A.2d 1259" data-case-ids="9043600" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1259-01">864 A.2d at 1264</a>. Therefore, the fact plaintiff “lives in Monroe County ... [and] ... is plainly inconveniencing herself’<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> was not a factor that should have inured to the benefit of defendant.</p>

This Court has previously observed that a site visit is <em>“seldom </em>necessary,” <em>Johns v. First Union Corporation, </em><a href="/a2d/777/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="777 A.2d 489" data-case-ids="11079868" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0489-01">777 A.2d 489</a>, 492 (Pa.Super.2001) (emphasis supplied), and our experience is that such visits are rarely conducted. Moreover, it bespeaks the obvious to state that as a matter of grammatical construction if something “may be necessary” it is equally true that “it may not be <a id="p853" href="#p853" data-label="853" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*853</a>necessary.” Thus, such a mere guess about the likelihood of a future step can hardly be construed as the type of “detailed information on the record” that was mandated by the Supreme Court in <em>Cheeseman, supra. </em>Therefore, a defendant’s vacuous contention about what yet “may” be, can hardly be regarded as an adequate basis to deny the plaintiff her choice of forum.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

    <p id="b883-5" data-blocks='[["BL_883.4",883,[180,802,754,820]]]'>¶ 9 The further thought occurs that defendant’s emphasis on the necessity for a jury view seems contrived given the facts (1) that it was unlikely, some six to twelve months later, that the scene would be substantially the same as when the insurance company denied coverage, and (2) that the rationale that a view would be needed “for the purpose of assessing damages” was inconsistent with defendant’s asserted defenses of no liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Moreover, there is no reason to believe that photographs, videos, or even an internet transmitted web-cast, could not suffice to provide the jury a sense of the condition of the property and the damages claimed.</p>

True it is that this compensation will ultimately be borne by appellee, but such costs strikes this Court as a normal expense of a party to litigation. Moreover, the reliance of appellee upon the incremental expense of an appearance of an adjuster at trial ignores the corollary effect that by transferring this case to Monroe County, appellee would actually be faced with the significantly greater defense expense of the compensation of Philadelphia defense counsel to travel to, and/or stay in, Monroe County for the duration of the trial. Thus, there is no basis upon which to find that appellant’s choice of forum would constitute harassment, or prove vexatious or oppressive to the defendant.</p>

The standard governing our review of a trial court's decision on a transfer of venue based upon a claim of <em>forum non conveniens </em>is one of abuse of discretion.

It bears mention that appellee in its brief to this Court incorrectly states that "[t]he most important consideration for the court in determining whether to grant a transfer of venue based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>is whether or not an alternative forum is available to the plaintiff.” Brief of Appellee, p. 6. This is a clear misstatement of the law, since, as the Supreme Court in <em>Cheeseman </em>made clear, the only relevant inquiry is whether the plaintiff’s choice of forum is oppressive or vexatious to the defendant. Appellee's error, which is obvious from its reliance on the case of <em>Farley v. McDonnell Douglas Truck Services, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/432/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="432 Pa.

C.S. § 5322(e), which permits the complete dismissal or transfer of a cause of action to an out-of-state forum, from (2) those cases in which a transfer is sought pursuant to Rule 1006(d)(1) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
      <p id="b881-14" data-blocks='[["BL_881.11",881,[997,1886,718,794]]]'>It bears further comment that appellee's argument to the trial court was similarly erroneously grounded upon a statutory <em>forum non conveniens </em>case, namely, <em>D’Alterio v.

The distinction is significant, since in a statutory <em>forum non conveniens </em>case it is appropriate to consider the public factor of having a jury be burdened with a case to which it "has no relation to the litigation,” <em>D’Alterio, supra, </em>at 852, whereas that is not a consideration in a Rule 1006 <em>forum non conveniens </em>case. <em>See generally: Johnson v.

In its Opinion filed in support of its decision, the trial court opined that it transferred the case "to the more appropriate forum <em>and alleviated defendant of plaintiffs forum shopping." </em>Trial Court Opinion, <em>supra, </em>p. 7 (emphasis supplied). However, as emphasized above, the inquiry called for by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is not which forum is "more appropriate,” but whether the defendant can sustain its burden to show that defending its position in that chosen forum would be "vexatious.” Moreover, the law of Pennsylvania does not preclude “forum shopping” <em>per se. </em>In fact, there may be quite appropriate reasons for a plaintiff to seek a certain forum — for example, a forum might, as here, be closer to the office of plaintiff’s attorney, or closer to a transportation center. Thus, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not precluded "forum shopping,” and the mere invocation of that phrase does not trigger such a talismanic effect as to cause an abrupt termination of the inquiry.</p>
