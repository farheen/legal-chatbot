Debra Oglesby came to the front of the line and demanded immediate service. She became quite agitated when Mr. Holl-ingsworth, a Safeway checker, advised her that she would have to wait in line with the other customers. Sensing that something was wrong with the woman, the cashier then asked the other customers if they would allow Oglesby to be checked out first. Several of the customers, including appellant, objected.</p>

Hearing the argument, Mr. Johnson, a store guard who was a Seaboard employee, came to the counter from the rear of the store. He requested that Ogles-by either refrain from swearing or leave the store. Johnson carried neither a gun nor Mace, but did have a night stick.</p>

Meanwhile, the checker Hollingsworth took the ice pick from the assailant. Oglesby was placed under arrest. Appellant spent seven days in the hospital recuperating from his injuries.</p>

We said in the <em>Cook </em>case that we are aware of the urban crime problem, but we concluded that this does not put any additional duty on grocery stores to insure the safety of their customers against all harm. We stated: “But simply because this hazard [of criminal activity] exists, it does not follow that the common law of negligence imposes an obligation upon private enterprises to provide armed guards to insure the safety of persons invited to do business with them.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In that case an intoxicated and <a id="p1383" href="#p1383" data-label="1383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1383</a>belligerent employee (who happened to be off duty but was on the restaurant’s premises) grabbed and struck a patron after acting in an aggressive and angry way for quite some time. He had struck another customer before punching and fighting with Grasso. This court determined that the restaurant reasonably should have anticipated that the intoxicated off-duty employee might injure a patron. The instant case is different. There is no evidence that anyone connected with the case had known or seen the assailant before the incident in question. The events leading up to the assault occurred quite rapidly. We conclude that the trial judge did not err in finding as a matter of law that no duty was owed by appellees to insure the safety of appellant from an unforeseeable criminal attack. Since there was no duty, there was no breach of duty upon which a negligence action could be based and appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Willis v.

We think as a matter of law that appellees had no opportunity to warn appellant. A shopkeeper has a duty to warn only when there is time to do so. <em>Fulfer v.

Generally, there is no duty to warn of a danger which is as well known to the invitee as to the owner. 65 C.J.S. <em>Negligence </em>§ 63(53) (1966); <em>see also S. Kann’s Sons Corp. v. Hayes, </em>D.C.

No opportunity to warn was present in the instant case. The assailant searched her purse for a matter of seconds while everyone watched, not knowing what the woman would take from her bag. After the assailant’s hand emerged with an ice pick “she went like a wild lady” towards appellant. Appellees had no greater warning as to what Oglesby would do than did anyone else present.</p>

In <em>Viands, </em>the store manager had known for several months of the potential hazard posed by the presence of numerous young boys who blocked the exits with their wagons in hopes of carrying bags for customers. Here, there is nothing to suggest that appellees knew of the isolated attack on appellant in advance. We conclude that the trial judge did not err in deciding that there was no legal duty to warn appellant. Appellees met their burdens on the facts, and the trial court did not err in granting the motions for summary judgment.</p>
