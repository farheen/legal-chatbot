      <p id="b741-13" data-blocks='[["BL_741.13",741,[132,2131,1323,297]]]'> Both parties argue the merits of whether or not Taylor’s <em>1960 </em>application supports the counts. Both the examiner, in a decision on motion, and the board held it does. We. consider such issue' to be here irrelevant since, as correctly noted by the board, “In order for Taylor to prevail, in this proceeding, he must show that the counts read on his <em>parent </em>application * * (Emphasis ours.) Further, the board earlier in its Opinion sdid, “this parent application of Taylor was the very basis for'the declaration of the instant interference <em>* * *. </em>If this were not the case,' the Taylor involved application [filed in I960] would have been rejected on the Hall patent since the effective date of the latter is <em>prior </em>to the filing date of the-involved Taylor application.”</p>

      <p id="b742-14" data-blocks='[["BL_742.14",742,[218,2295,1321,128]]]'> Taylor filed a motion under Rule 235 to shift the burden of proof to Hall on grounds that Taylor’s parent application supports the counts. The motion was denied, the examiner holding that the parent Taylor application disclosed no “embodiment” setting for the parameters of the counts and thus did not support the counts.</p>
