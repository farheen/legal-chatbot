Consequently, for the thirteen years that Claimant worked for Employer, he traded shifts with other employees so that he always could work the third (night) shift. However, in September 1995, Employer adopted a rotating shift schedule, which required Claimant to rotate between day shift, second shift and third shift. Due to the shift changes, Claimant was unable to get the sleep and rest he needed, and Claimant began to suffer increased stress, ulcer flare-ups and a worsening of pain in his leg and low back. Claimant and his treating physician repeatedly requested that Employer place Claimant on third shift permanently, but Employer refused.

Subsequently, the employer filed a modification petition alleging that the claimant’s disability had changed and that he was able to return to work. Thereafter, a WCJ granted the employer a supersedeas reducing the amount of the claimant’s benefits from total to partial. Despite that order, the employer unilaterally stopped paying partial benefits, and the claimant requested penalties. The employer subsequently filed a termination petition alleging that the claimant’s work-related injury had ceased. Following hearings, the WCJ granted the employer’s termination petition and dismissed the modification petition and the claimant’s penalty petition as moot. The WCAB affirmed, and on appeal to this court, we also affirmed. After determining that termination of benefits was properly granted, we concluded that the <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>WCJ correctly refused to award penalties based on the employer’s unilateral stoppage of payments.

The employer paid the claimant benefits for the related period of disability. After a period of time, the claimant's lung functions <em>returned to </em>normal, but, on his physician’s recommendation, the claimant did not return to the work because that would again aggravate his pre-existing condition. The claimant applied for workers’ compensation benefits, which the WCJ granted. The WCAB and this court both affirmed, concluding that when a return to work would exacerbate a pre-existing condition, the employee is entitled to benefits even if the preexisting condition is not work related. The supreme court disagreed, concluding it undermines the principles of the Act to impose liability on an employer for a pre-existing condition <em>when no residual work-related injury is demonstrated. </em>Because the claimant had <em>completely recovered </em>from the work-related injury, i.e., aggravation of asthma, and his loss of earning power was due solely to non-work-related causes, the supreme court held that the claimant was ineligible for benefits.</p>
