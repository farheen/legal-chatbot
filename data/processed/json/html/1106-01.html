Employer, on the other hand, contended that Claimant had quit to take care of his children while his wife was in another city for job training and that full-time work was available for Claimant. The Indiana Job Center (job center), crediting Employer, denied benefits. Claimant appealed. Following a telephone hearing during which both parties testified, the referee issued a decision denying benefits to Claimant. The referee’s decision, notifying Claimant that he had fifteen days after mailing in which to appeal, identified the decision mailing date as October 14, 1993. (R.R. at 45a.) Claimant appealed to the Board on October 29,1993. (R.R. at 53a.) The Board remanded to the referee for additional testimony so that the Board would have complete information regarding all matters at issue for its consideration. Following the second hearing, the Board resolved conflicts in the testimony and issues of credibility in favor of Claimant and concluded that Claimant, who had requested a regular work schedule so that he could hire babysitters while his wife was out of town, had not quit his job with Employer but was discharged by Employer. (Board’s Findings of Fact, Nos. 6-12.) The Board concluded that Claimant was entitled to benefits.</p>
