The parties entered into a contract on January 30, 1989 for the sale and installation of a commercial oven. A four-page written sales contract, including annexed drawings, were attached as exhibits to the judge’s report. The contract was drafted by the defendant and signed by Mr. John Anderson as president of the plaintiff corporation. The oven was described in the contract as a “three-deck, Benini model tunnel oven” designed for the baking of muffins and cakes. The purchase price was stated as two hundred and sixty thousand dollars ($260,000), which included assembly and installation of the oven at <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>plaintiffs place of business. Payment terms required the plaintiff to pay 25% of the purchase price with the signing of the contract, 65% upon notification of shipment, with the remaining 10% payable 30 days after start-up.</p>
    <p id="b9-3" data-blocks='[["BL_9.4",9,[140,369,1331,120]]]'>The report states that the oven was installed in May, 1989. The remaining 10% balance due after installation, which was the subject of the defendant’s counterclaim, was never paid by the plaintiff.</p>

At the left center of the drawing is a line drawn through a square area which depicts the location of the tunnel oven. The notation above the line reads: “Gas, 780,000 B.T.U.’s.” Reading both the contract and the annexed drawing together, the trial judge found the heating capacity required under the contract to be 780,000 B.T.U.’s rather than 1,000,000 B.T.U.’s. On this basis, the trial judge concluded that the plaintiff’s claim of breach amounted to a difference of 30,000 B.T.U.’s — between the 780,000 B.T.U.’s required by the contract and the 750,000 B.T.U. burner received.</p>

At its core, the plaintiff’s claim of breach (and all related claims) rests upon the view that the seller was contractually obligated to provide an oven with a minimum heating capacity of 1,000,000 B.T.U.’s. This was not the finding of the trial judge. It appears from the judge’s report and the annexed documents that the heating capacity of the oven required under the contract was fully litigated in the course of the day long trial in this matter. As mentioned above, the provision in the parties written contract relevant to the oven’s heating capacity stated: “Operating Range — 1 million BTU’s.” Clearly the word “range” in this context lent some doubt as to the precise heating capacity required under the contract. It is certainly plausible that such language would imply that either something more or something less than one million B.T.U.’s was within the intention of the parties. ‘Where the meaning of a term of contract does not appear <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>unambiguously from the instrument, its interpretation is a matter for the [fact-finder.]” Gillentine <em>v.

In its brief, the plaintiff states that the judge was mistaken as to the sufficiency of notice required by a buyer to revoke acceptance under G.L.c. 106, §2-607(3)(a), arguing that they made “repeated phone calls to the seller” in order to resolve this matter prior to their resort to writing. In effect, plaintiff argues that the trial judge mistakenly believed that only written notice of revocation would be sufficient to assert its rights under G.L.c. 106, §2-607.
