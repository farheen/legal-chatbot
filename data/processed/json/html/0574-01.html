The victims exited a major highway, only to discover they had done so by mistake. The fatal accident occurred when the driver/vietim attempted to make a U-turn, and the appellee struck the passenger side of the vehicle broadside. Appellee, who was driving while under suspension, panicked and left the scene, after he purportedly inquired as to the victims’ injuries and attempted to call 911. At sentencing, the court noted the tragic consequences suffered by both the victims and the appellee, and voiced his concern over placing appel-lee in a state facility where, “you don’t wind up with other people that have been convicted of this same crime. You wind up with other people that have been convicted of serious felonies and violent crimes, and I’m going to try to provide for that in my sentence.” (N.T. at 22.) The court acknowledged the mandatory sentence required by law, and stated, “[wje’re here to try to exact some kind of fair-to-all concerned consequences, and the legislature sometimes takes that job out of the hands of the sentencing court.” <em>(Id. </em>at 21-22.)

The latter goal grows out of a recognition that “state” sentences inevitably subject the defendant to the uncertain choices of the State Board of Probation and Parole and also result in imprisonment in a remote facility without easy access to family, friends and those who might offer counsel both legal and personal. Also involved is the accessibility of programs such as work release.</p>
