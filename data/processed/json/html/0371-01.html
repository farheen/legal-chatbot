Criticism was aimed at the measure in its original form that such consolidation, when directed by municipalities without available professional competence in the electrical field, would expose telephone users to danger. By amendment the “40,000 inhabitants” qualification was added “which restricted it (the bill) entirely to Portland where they have a City Electrician.” Legislative Record 1909, pp. 1186-1188, 1194. The revocation of pole permits was only incidental to the consolidation and there is nothing in the legislative record to suggest that the 1885 statute referred to above and discussed in <em>Readfield, </em>supra, was in any way affected. 2) Assuming, without finding, that the 1909 Act, by indirection, intended that municipalities of 40,000 inhabitants or less should not revoke pole permits, such legislative intention is not pertinent to our problem. The controlling intention as to whether a pole becomes a part of the real estate by accession is not that of the legislature or the town, but that of the annexor.</p>
