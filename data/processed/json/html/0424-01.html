In my view, the General Assembly intended that for all mandatory prison terms, an offender must have a chance to reform following a prior conviction before he is sentenced as a second offender.

    <p id="b474-2" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[214,613,751,837]]]'>Our decisions in <em>Hall </em>and <em>Buckingham </em>in 1984 were consistent with this express intent of the General Assembly that mandatory penalties for a second offense be reserved for those individuals not rehabilitated after an encounter with the criminal justice system and a chance to reform. Our decision in this case should also be consistent with that intention. Such an interpretation would not preclude the sentencing judge from imposing a severe sanction if warranted by the facts of an individual case. Indeed, under this interpretation the Superior Court could impose the same sentence it did, but would have to act deliberatively rather than automatically-</p>
