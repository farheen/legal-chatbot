The patent, involved a railway ticket comprising a body portion and a coupon, the ticket bearing conventional indications showing that the body alone was good at one time of the day and that the body and the coupon were required for the other portion of the day. The court there held that the device of the patent clearly involved physical structure and that the claims were limited to such structure.</blockquote>

We are not impressed with the contention that the <em>Cincinnati Traction Company </em>case, <em>supra, </em>is authority for sustaining appellant’s contention. On the contrary, the case is easily distinguishable from the case at bar.' There the material upon which the printing appeared had a novel form, which form served, a new and useful purpose.
