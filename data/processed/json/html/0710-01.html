Briefly, after a defendant is convicted of a predicate offense, but before he is sentenced, the trial court directs the Board to make an initial assessment as to whether he should be classified as a sexually violent predator, that is, whether he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder making him likely to engage in future “predatory sexually violent offenses.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9792. The Board makes this assessment based upon various statutorily-prescribed, risk-related criteria and guidelines, as well as any other generally-applicable standards established by the Board. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(b). After the Board issues its recommendation, the district attorney may request a hearing before the trial court to determine whether the individual should be adjudicated as a sexually violent predator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The individual and the district attorney are “given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(e)(2); each may offer and cross-examine witnesses, including expert witnesses, and the defendant additionally retains the right to be represented by counsel, appointed if necessary. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court determines whether the Commonwealth has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is a sexually violent predator. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(e)(3). If the court so concludes, the individual is subject to lifetime registration, notification, and counseling; otherwise, he is deemed an “offender,” and is subject to registration only, for a period of either ten years or the remainder of his life, depending upon the predicate offense and/or the number of convictions. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1; <em>Williams II, </em>— Pa. at -, <a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">832 A.2d at 967-68</a>.</p>

In applying this test, the court stated initially that the Commonwealth and the defendant each has a compelling interest in ensuring that an accurate determination is made regarding whether the defendant is a sexually violent predator: the Commonwealth has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens through prompt notification, and the registrant has a compelling interest in avoiding notification and counseling if he is not a sexually violent predator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> As to the second element, the court concluded that there is a substantial risk of error due to the procedures used, because determining whether the individual is a sexually violent predator constitutes a “subjective factual determination which is subject to substantial uncertainty.” Trial Court op. at 7. Finally, the court noted that utilization of a reasonable-doubt standard would be more burdensome to the Commonwealth, but stated that this extra burden was outweighed by its effect of lowering the risk of error to the individual. Accordingly, the trial court held that nothing less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt would satisfy the demands of the Due Process Clause. See <em>id.</em>

Briefly, the function of a standard of proof is to instruct the factfinder as to the level of confidence that society believes he should have in the correctness of his conclusion; furthermore, different standards of proof reflect differences in how society believes the risk of error should be distributed as between the litigants. Thus, the most stringent standard — beyond a reasonable doubt — is applicable in criminal trials due to the gravity of the private interests affected; these interests lead to a societal judgment that, given the severe loss that occurs when an individual is erroneously convicted of a ci’ime, the public should bear virtually the entire risk of error. The preponderanee-of-the-evi-dence standard, by contrast, reflects a belief that the two sides should share the risk equally; for this reason, it is applicable in a civil dispute over money damages, where the parties may share an intense interest in the outcome, but the public’s interest in the result is “minimal.” <em>Addington, </em><a href="/us/441/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="441 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="1780484" data-case-paths="/us/441/0418-01">441 U.S. at 423</a>, <a href="/us/441/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="441 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="1780484" data-case-paths="/us/441/0418-01">99 S.Ct. at 1808</a>; <em>Williams I, </em>557 Pa. at 306, 733 A.2d at 604.

In that matter, the Court analyzed a New York statute under which the state could terminate the rights of parents in the care and custody of their children upon a finding, by a “fair preponderance of the evidence,” that the child in question was “permanently neglected.” The Court determined that the preponderance standard was constitutionally deficient because the consequences of an erroneous decision were far greater to the individual than to the state, and thus, the parties should not be asked to share equally the risk of error. <em>See Santosky, </em><a href="/us/455/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="455 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="11307633" data-case-paths="/us/455/0745-01">455 U.S. at 768</a>, <a href="/us/455/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="455 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="11307633" data-case-paths="/us/455/0745-01">102 S.Ct. at 1402</a>. Then, drawing from the analysis in <em>Addington, </em>the <em>Santosky </em>Court also rejected the proposition that the state should be held to a reasonable-doubt standard in termination proceedings.

The Commonwealth contends that, if the Board issues a negative assessment — that is, a finding that the individual is not a sexually violent predator — the Commonwealth will almost never request a judicial hearing on the matter, and sentencing will proceed in the normal course. <em>See </em>Brief at 12. However, there is no evidence in the record concerning the frequency or circumstances under which the Commonwealth would request a hearing on the matter after a negative recommendation from the Board.</p>

The trial court also indicated that the individual has a compelling interest in avoiding the threat of lifetime probation or incarceration for any violation of the registration and address verification requirements. <em>See </em>Trial Court op. at 4 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9795.2(d)(2), 9796(3)(2)). This Court subsequently invalidated these penalty provisions and severed them from the Act. <em>See Williams II, </em>- Pa. at -, <a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">832 A.2d at 985</a>. A fair reading of the trial court’s opinion suggests, however, that its analysis and outcome would not have been substantially altered by the absence of these measures. Accordingly, we believe it best to resolve the present appeal on the merits rather than remanding for reconsideration in light of <em>Williams II.</em>
