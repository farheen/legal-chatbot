To accomplish this change, it sought a variance from the New Castle County Board of Adjustment.</p>

In doing so, it employed the standard pertinent to use variance requests, namely, that the applicant must show “unnecessary hardship.” Wawa’s current store is a proper use for the zone in which it is located and the surface commercial zone would permit such a use. But the lot on which it sits is on or closely proximate to important water resources. As a result, current New Castle County ordinances relating to subsurface conditions prohibit the construction of new gasoline pumping and underground storage tanks any such area. A variance would, therefore, be needed.</p>
    <p id="b873-13" data-blocks='[["BL_873.16",873,[974,690,755,922]]]'>The “unnecessary hardship” standard employed to test “use” variances is triggered when the proposed use is for a purpose contrary to zoning laws or regulations. While Wawa’s current store is a proper use, the dispensing of petroleum products and the adjunct storage needed to do so otherwise would block Wawa’s proposed use. It, however, points to the existence of two gasoline stations in current operation on other corners of the same Tybouts Corner intersection where its proposed gasoline station would be located. That fact, however, does not trigger the less stringent test for an area variance, which is a variance not proposing a usage otherwise prohibited. Those service stations are non-confirming uses.</p>

One such store is located on the southeast corner of Hamburg Road and South DuPont Parkway (just north of the Delaware Route 1 overpass) which it has operated there for years. This location, termed the Tybouts Corner site, does not now sell gasoline products. At this same intersection there are, however, two other convenience stores owned by Wawa competitors, each selling gasoline products. The site is also within 300 feet of a public water supply well operated by Artesian Water Company.</p>

This box is to be checked when the applicant wanted “to use property for use other than that allowed by its zoning classification.... ” There is, however, no box <em>titled </em>Area Variance. The box that comes closest is titled Dimensional Variance. When checking this box, the applicant is to “State size of variance being requested (example: variance from the required 6 foot side yard setback to construct [maintain] a dwelling 4.2 feet from the northerly property line).” As Wawa was not requesting a variance in the dimensions of the property, this box was not applicable to its request. The other boxes to be checked, Special Use, Appeal from an Administrative Decision, Confirmation of a Non Conforming Use and Beneficial Use Appeal, were not applicable to the site in question. The Court does not find that Wawa’s checking of the Use Variance box determinative as to whether Wawa requested a use variance or an area variance as there was no other applicable box.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_27" id="ref_footnote_1_27">27</a>
