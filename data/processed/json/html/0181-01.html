Gehring soon learned that the department considered him to have less seniority than another recent hire who had never before worked for the Borough. Feeling that he was due greater credit for his prior part-time work, Gehring disputed his seniority calculation, and the Hamburg Police Officers’ Association filed a grievance on his behalf.

      <em>see </em>43 P.S. §§ 211.6, 211.8, by terminating him solely in retaliation for his engaging in protected union activity (the challenge to his seniority calculation). In response, the Secretary of the PLRB advised Gehring that the agency would not issue a complaint under Section 8 of the PLRA, 43 P.S. § 211.8.

The Board acknowledged Gehring’s argument that the decision in <em>Township of Sugarloaf v. Bowling, </em><a href="/pa/563/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="563 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1367003" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0237-01">563 Pa. 237</a>, <a href="/a2d/759/0913-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="759 A.2d 913" data-case-ids="11233630,1367003" data-case-paths="/a2d/759/0913-01,/pa/563/0237-01">759 A.2d 913</a> (2000) (relegating the question of the arbitrability of a probationary police officer’s grievance to the arbitration forum in the first instance), contained strong indications that probationary police officers retain definite labor-law interests. However, in light of <em>Upper Makefield </em>and <em>Pennsylvania State Police v. PLRB, </em>the Board did not feel that it could identify a <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>principled basis for opening statutory unfair labor practices protections to probationary police officers. Indeed, the Board explained that in <em>Pennsylvania State Police v. PLRB </em>it had requested a reexamination of the <em>Upper Makefield </em>decision, but that this request was not granted. As such, the Board believed that it was constrained to hold that a probationary police officer does not, as a matter of law, enjoy state labor-law protections, and that the PLRB therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider Gehring’s claim of an unfair labor practice.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[187,981,754,1319]],["BL_217.5",217,[986,252,751,197]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court vacated the Board’s order denying Gehring’s exceptions. <em>See Gehring v. PLRB, </em><a href="/a2d/850/0805-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="850 A.2d 805" data-case-ids="9230279" data-case-paths="/a2d/850/0805-01">850 A.2d 805</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2004). The court read <em>Upper Makefield </em>as confined to holding that Act 111, in and of itself, does not grant any rights to probationary employees. Further, the Commonwealth Court treated <em>Pennsylvania State Police v. PLRB </em>as foreclosing unfair labor practice claims of probationary police officers only where the underlying claim is based on a term and condition of employment arising out of a past practice, but not where the term or condition might arise otherwise, such as from a collective bargaining agreement or provisions of statutory law. The court then identified the PLRA as a root source of labor-law interests for probationary police officers. In this regard, the Commonwealth Court observed that the PLRA grants the right to file an unfair labor practice petition to “employes” generally and defines “employe” broadly enough to encompass probationary employees. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 211.3(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Having concluded that the Board had jurisdiction, the Commonwealth Court directed it to proceed under the PLRA to determine whether a complaint should issue.</p>

As background, they explain that, because Act 111 grants collective bargaining rights to police officers and firemen, but lacks the means to protect the exercise of those rights, and the PLRA contains the necessary means of protection, this Court has directed that Act 111 and the PLRA should be read as one statute. <em>See Philadelphia Fire Officers Association v. PLRB, </em><a href="/pa/470/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="470 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1723803" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0550-01">470 Pa. 550</a>, 555, <a href="/pa/470/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="470 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1723803" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0550-01">369 A.2d 259</a>, 261 (1977). According to the PLRB, this, has worked effectively to provide similar protections for police and fire employees as exist under the Public Employe Relations Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which is applicable to all other public employers in the Commonwealth. The parties complain, however, that the Commonwealth Court’s decision upsets this unifying scheme by creating separate definitions of “employe” for purposes of Act 111 and the PLRA. Further, the parties argue that the Commonwealth Court’s construction places probationary police officers in the anomalous position of <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>seemingly possessing the statutory right to organize for purposes of collective bargaining, but of nevertheless being denied collective bargaining rights.</p>

However, the PLRB notes that the result in <em>Upper Makefield </em>had in fact represented a rejection of the Board’s analysis that the legislative policy of Act 111 required submission of the contractual dispute to be decided in the first instance by an arbitrator. <em>See Upper Makefield, </em><a href="/pa/562/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="562 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="225997" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0113-01">562 Pa. at 118</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0803-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="753 A.2d 803" data-case-ids="11213247,225997" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0803-01,/pa/562/0113-01">753 A.2d at 806</a> (holding that “a probationary [police officer] is not entitled to register a grievance should he or she not be retained past the probationary period,” and stating that such officers do not come within the ambit of Act 111 protections). The Board respectfully suggests that it is <em>Township of Su-garloaf </em>that supports its historic position that probationary employees are covered by Act 111 and have an enforceable right to bargain collectively.
