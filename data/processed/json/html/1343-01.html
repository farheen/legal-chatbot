Although they divorced a year later, Lance and Mary continued their relationship. In December 1992, Serena confronted Mary about the abuse she had suffered at the hands of Lance. Mary acknowledged that she believed Serena’s allegations. This ac-knowledgement did not lead Mary to sever her relationship with Lance. In February 199B, Mary arranged to have Lance stay in her apartment while she was at work to protect against vandalism. Lance maintained an apartment in Mary’s apartment building after the divorce.
