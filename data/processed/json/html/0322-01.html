Their latter claim — that a lower standard of proof applies to alleged violations of D.C.Code §§ 28-3904, -3312 than to identical claims under common law — creates a question of first impression for this court.

The Os-bournes became delinquent and, faced with the threat of foreclosure, negotiated refinancing with First Government Mortgage &amp; Investment Corporation (First Government). First Government, in turn, selected Mid-Atlantic Title, Inc. (Mid-Atlantic) to conduct the settlement. On May 31, 1989, Mid-Atlantic delivered a check in the amount of $24,346.51 (the Osbournes’ alleged balance) to Capital City. Due to expenses incurred as a result of the cancelled foreclosure sale, however, Capital City continued to show a balance on the Osbournes’ account. In September of 1990, with Capital City again threatening foreclosure, Mid-Atlantic paid the remaining balance and requested payment from appellants. Appellants failed to make payment, and instead initiated the underlying litigation against Capital City.</p>

Yet, while the CPPA is broad in the conduct it proscribes, even more important perhaps is the array of enforcement mechanisms it contains for the protection of consumers. The CPPA empowers agency investigation and regulation of businesses, §§ 28-3902, -3903, establishes consumer complaint procedures, § 28-3905, and allows for civil actions in Superior Court for multiple damages and fees, § 28-3905(k)(l). Despite its comprehensive scope, however, the CPPA does not address a consumer’s burden of proof under the Act’s protections.

By application of these rules to the CPPA, we reach the conclusion that a claim for intentional misrepresentation under the Act requires the same burden of proof as does a common law claim for such misrepresentation — the clear and convincing standard. <em>See </em>Standardized Civil Jury Instructions For The District Of Columbia, No. 20-3 (1998 rev. ed.); <em>cf.

If we were to hold, as urged by appellants, that consumers have a lesser burden of proof under the CPPA, such a ruling would have serious implications. For example, § 28-3905(k)(l)(C) allows for a wronged consumer to recover punitive damages. By appellants’ logic, although punitive damages requires clear and convincing evidence at common law, <em>see </em>STANDARDIZED Civil Juky INSTRUCTIONS For The District Of Columbia, No. 16-1 (1998 rev. ed.), requesting punitive damages under the CPPA would be available on a considerably lesser showing.

Similar to the CPPA, nowhere within the text of the IRCA, nor within our review of its legislative history, is the consumer’s burden of proof discussed. Thus, applying the same statutory analysis employed <em>supra, </em>we conclude a consumer’s burden when alleging intentional misrepresentation under the IRCA is the clear and convincing standard.</p>

    <p id="b380-11" data-blocks='[["BL_380.12",380,[1026,488,754,652]]]'>Having failed to establish any proof of actual damages, the trial court properly granted appellee’s motion for directed verdict as to appellants’ unlawful breach and negligent misrepresentation claims. Further, we reject appellants’ contention that a claim of intentional misrepresentation under the CPPA or under the IRCA carries a lesser burden of proof then a similar claim under common law. Accordingly, the trial court’s decision to apply the common law clear and convincing standard to appellants’ statutory claim of intentional misrepresentation was not error.</p>
