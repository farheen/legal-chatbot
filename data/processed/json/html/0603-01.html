The trial judge instructed the jury that it could find Dr. Nimetz liable on any of six different theories of negligence, including a theory to which Dr. Nimetz had objected as being unsupported by the evidence. Conceding that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find negligence on the five other theories, Dr. Nimetz renews his contention on appeal that the judge erred in submitting the remaining theory to the jury since Mr. Cappadona failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a breach of the standard of care. Dr. Ni-metz opposed Mr. Cappadona’s request for a special verdict form, and the trial judge decided to use a general verdict form. On appeal Dr. Nimetz contends that because the general verdict does not make clear whether the jury relied on the unsupported theory, the proper remedy is to remand for a new trial.</p>

At the close of the evidence Mr. Cappadona requested, in order to avoid a later issue on appeal, that the jury be presented with a special verdict form requiring it to indicate whether it found negligence with regard to each of the theories of liability. Dr. Ni-metz opposed this request, and we hold that he is therefore barred from raising on appeal the contention that the jury may have relied on the improper theory.</p>

Dr. Nimetz, a cardiologist, became the primary physician and ordered that Streptokinase (a drug to reduce blood clots) be administered. Shortly after the drug was administered, Mr. Cappadona began to experience unusual symptoms, including coughing, tightness in the neck, a flushed face, and trouble breathing. Dr. Nimetz ordered that Bena-dryl be administered, and that a catheteri-zation procedure be performed. During the catheterization another dose of Strep-tokinase was administered. Mr. Cappado-na’s condition did not improve, and later that night Dr. Nimetz learned that Mr. Cappadona had low blood pressure but very high cardiac output. Dr. Nimetz determined that this unusual phenomenon could have resulted from any of four different causes: an infection, an unusual reaction to the Streptokinase, a “vasodilatory phenomenon,” or a vascular collapse. Dr. Nimetz ordered drug treatment for all four possible causes, but Mr. Cappadona did not improve. In the early morning hours, Dr. Nimetz left the hospital.</p>
    <p id="b670-8" data-blocks='[["BL_670.8",670,[1024,941,748,681]]]'>Later in the morning Dr. Nimetz prescribed a drug called “Levophed” in order to increase Mr. Cappadona’s blood pressure. When there was no effect Dr. Ni-metz ordered “massive doses” of the drug. Later still, because of persistent low blood pressure and high cardiac output, Dr. Ni-metz inserted a “balloon pump” to increase the blood pressure to the lower extremities. Ultimately, Mr. Cappadona’s right leg had to be amputated at the knee, a portion of his left foot was amputated, and 75 to 90 percent of his stomach was removed. The hospital bills totaled around $300,000.</p>

During the discussion of the jury instructions, Dr. Nimetz objected to an instruction on negligent failure to consult. Mr. Cappa-dona thereafter requested that the jury be provided with a special verdict form on which the jury could specify, for each of the six theories, whether Dr. Nimetz had been negligent. Dr. Nimetz opposed the request, and the trial judge decided to submit a general verdict form. The jury returned a general verdict in favor of Mr. <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>Cappadona for $2.5 million.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although at the time of the trial, counsel for Dr. Nimetz had every right to object to the special verdict form, the reason he offered, while not exactly frivolous, did nothing to outweigh the benefits of having a special verdict form submitted to the jury where the defendant claimed one of six theories should not be presented to the jury. Furthermore, counsel for Dr. Nimetz remarked that “the jury can perfectly well say in one finding, did Dr. Nimitz [sic] adhere to the standard of care or didn’t he,” thus suggesting either that counsel was willing to live with the general verdict, or that he was seeking to preserve an issue on appeal in the event the jury found for Mr. Cappadona. In view of Mr. Cappadona’s effort to avoid a new trial on precisely the ground raised on appeal, it would be unfortunate, to say the least, to subject Mr. Cappadona to the prospect of a new trial when Dr. Nimetz has conceded liability under five of the six theories of negligence. Dr. Nimetz, moreover, has no basis on which to claim that it would work an “injustice to a party because of reliance on the continued validity of the prior legal rule <em>..Mendes, supra </em>note 5, 389 A.2d at 789, since there was no prior rule on special verdicts on which to rely.</p>

Mr. Cappadona argues on appeal that "there is a duty by law, clear common sense and medical standards to consult on an issue that is above a particular physician’s ken.” The court has made clear, however, that ”[t]he standard of care in medical malpractice cases must ordinarily be proven by expert testimony." <em>Meek v.
