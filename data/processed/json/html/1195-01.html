The lower court admitted the evidence of Bennett’s arrest on April 22, 1999, for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver on the grounds that it was relevant to show that Bennett was the actual possessor of the cocaine, i.e., he was acting in conformity with the events of April 22, 1999.

In this case, we need to focus on whether evidence of Bennett’s prior cocaine trafficking is relevant to his possible constructive possession of the cocaine found in his vehicle, <em>see </em>Pa.R.E. 402, and, if so, whether the probative value of that evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues or misleading the jury. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 403.</p>

Based upon the evidence introduced at trial, the jury could have concluded that Bennett had the power to control the cocaine since it was found in a vehicle he claimed was his. Significantly, evidence of Bennett’s entire history of cocaine trafficking would have supported a reasonable inference that he also had the intent to control the cocaine which was packaged for distribution. <em>Spencer, </em><a href="/pa-super/423/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="423 Pa.

In the present case, the concern over the undue prejudice such evidence might place upon a defendant is not present. Rather, here, the evidence is crucial to appellant’s defense.

At trial, the Commonwealth argued that it would be unfairly prejudiced by the admission of such evidence. However, we question whether unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth is even at issue, since Pa.R.E. 402(b) appears to be concerned only with prejudice to the defendant. <em>See </em>Packel &amp; Poulin, <em>Pennsylvania Evidence, </em>§ 404-10, p.222, 2nd Ed., 1999. Of course, when we consider the possible prejudice to the Commonwealth, it is clear that the prejudice is not “unfair.” In fact, it is arguable that such evidence would actually support the Commonwealth’s position that appellant constructively possessed the cocaine. In other words, the jury could certainly have decided that appellant’s travelling with a known cocaine-dealer in combination with his furtive movements during the traffic stop, his proximity to the cocaine and his admission to possession of the marijuana found in the exact same location as the cocaine was sufficient to prove that appellant jointly possessed the cocaine with Bennett. <em>Commonwealth v.

We acknowledge that the trial court did admit into evidence that Bennett was arrested on the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver arising out of events which occurred after the events in question. However, evidence of this single incident of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver which occurred after appellant’s arrest did not provide the jury with a complete picture of Bennett’s involvement in cocaine trafficking. Rather, evidence that Bennett was arrested four times in a period of two years and four months would certainly carry more weight with the jury that this isolated incident.

Evidence of Bennett’s prior cocaine arrests may tend to show that Bennett was more likely to possess cocaine. Such evidence may tend to inculpate Bennett by showing his propensity, but it does not exculpate Appellant. While it is axiomatic that evidence which tends to show that the crime for which an accused stands trial was committed by someone else is relevant and admissible,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">6</a> this axiom cannot be stretched to the point of permitting the admission of another person’s prior arrests (in violation of Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1)) when that person is not an accused, a complainant, or a witness.</p>

It is also undisputed that most courts applying the above rule have held that (subject to the exceptions outlined in 404(b)(2)) evidence of a defendant’s prior arrests is not admissible against that defendant to establish propensity. However, there is no authority for the assertion by the majority that “this rule [Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1) ] deals exclusively with the evidence of crimes, wrongs or acts which a party seeks to admit to prove something about an accused, a complainant or a witness.” Majority Opinion, at 1201.</p>
    <p id="b1246-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1246.11",1246,[986,855,749,351]]]'>¶ 4 A reasonable reading of the language of the rule indicates that “evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible <em>[regardless of the proponent of the evidence] </em>to prove the character of a person <em>[any person] </em>in order to show action in conformity therewith.”</p>

Prior actions or events that are not the subject of the litigation are simply irrelevant to show that a person probably acted or did not act in a certain way. The fact that a person was arrested for drug offenses in the past does not mean that the person was in possession of drugs on a separate occasion. The rule is geared towards attempts to introduce evidence of past conduct or event to establish that a person acted in conformity with the past conduct <a id="p1205" href="#p1205" data-label="1205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1205</a>or event. Therefore, the fact that a person is not on trial does not give a defendant an impetus to introduce evidence of that person’s prior arrests in violation of the above rule (404).</p>

Pa.R.E. 404, with certain enumerated exceptions, provides that character evidence cannot be used to prove conduct. Under this rule, evidence that an employee had a character trait of absent-mindedness would not be admissible to prove that on a particular occasion he or she failed to fasten the safety latch on a piece of equipment.

    <p id="Ag23" data-blocks='[["BL_1247.6",1247,[180,1258,753,1203]]]'>¶ 8 The above Comments amply support the notion that the primary purpose of the rule is to prohibit use of a character trait or past conduct or events to prove that a person acted or did not act in a certain way on a particular occasion. The language of the rule and the Comments do not indicate that this rule is inapplicable when the person whose character trait or past conduct is sought to be introduced is not on trial and is not a witness or a complainant. There is no logical reason to create such an exception. The drafters of the rule could have restricted its application to an accused, a complainant and a witness by drafting the rule to provide as follows: “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of <em>an accused, a witness, or a complainant, </em>is not admissible to prove the character of <em>an accused, a witness, or a complainant </em>in order to show action in conformity therewith.” However, the drafters did not restrict the rule in this way.</p>

Therefore, the drafter’s failure to restrict rule 404(b)(1) to an accused, a complainant, or a witness was deliberate rather than an oversight.</p>
    <p id="b1247-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1247.9",1247,[979,737,759,1262]]]'>¶ 10 Permitting defendants to introduce evidence of another person’s prior unrelated arrest is also patently unfair to the person whose prior arrests are being introduced as well as to the Commonwealth. The person is not a party to the litigation and does not have the opportunity to defend, dispute or explain the circumstances of the prior arrests and irrelevance of the prior arrests to the case against the defendants. Why should defendants be permitted to attack and pillage the character of another person who is not a party to the litigation and who has no opportunity to defend his character and the circumstances of his prior arrests? Because the person whose arrest is sought to be introduced into evidence is not a party to the litigation, that person has no opportunity to explain whether or not that arrest led to the filing of criminal charges, whether or not criminal charges filed as a result of the arrest were ultimately dismissed, or whether or not the person was acquitted of the charges filed as a result of the arrest.</p>

In such a case, for instance, accomplice A could proclaim his innocence at his trial and claim that accomplice B committed the crime alone. In support of this claim, accomplice A would introduce evidence of accomplice B’s prior arrests or <a id="p1206" href="#p1206" data-label="1206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1206</a>crimes. If accomplice B was not charged, then both individuals could get away with their crime. If accomplice B was being tried separately, he can also proclaim his innocence and blame accomplice A. He would then be permitted to introduce evidence of A’s prior arrests or convictions to show that A probably acted in conformity with his prior conduct.</p>
    <p id="b1248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1248.4",1248,[199,744,756,498]]]'>¶ 12 From the above illustration, it can be seen that permitting a defendant to introduce evidence of another person’s pri- or arrests would vitiate the language and the principle of Rule 404. It would allow the introduction of clearly irrelevant evidence of past conduct and events simply to show propensity. It would also be subject to abuse by co-conspirators and accomplices who are being tried separately.</p>
    <p id="b1248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1248.5",1248,[197,1264,756,242]]]'>¶ 13 It must also be pointed out that in light of the totality of the circumstances in this case, it is difficult to understand how Bennett’s prior drug arrests would be relevant in exculpating Appellant.</p>

The cocaine was found in the crack of the back seat next to where Appellant was seated. Significantly, Appellant admitted to possessing several bags of marijuana which were found in the exact same spot as the cocaine.</blockquote>

Further, as the majority correctly pointed out, Bennett was removed from the vehicle very early during the traffic stop and was not permitted to re-enter the vehicle. As such, Bennett could not have put the cocaine in the crack of the back seat after Appellant exited the car. These facts are clearly sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was in constructive possession of the cocaine at issue in this case. The admission of Bennett’s prior arrests would not change or cast doubt on any of the above facts: the admission of the arrests would not change the fact that the area where the cocaine was found was in Appellant’s immediate control or the fact that Appellant admitted possession of the bags of marijuana found next to the cocaine in the crack of the back seat. Therefore, the admission of Bennett’s pri- or drug arrests is irrelevant to Appellant’s constructive possession of the cocaine at issue in this case. Admission of such evidence would not help to establish or disprove Appellant’s constructive possession.</p>
