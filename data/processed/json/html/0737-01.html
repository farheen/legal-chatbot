    <p id="b802-8" data-blocks='[["BL_802.8",802,[209,916,751,656]]]'>This is an appeal from what purports to be a judgment of the Superior Court in Kennebec County. The action, referred to a Referee by agreement of the parties, sought a money judgment and the enforcement of a lien on defendants’ land and building to secure payment of the money damages. The Superior Court Justice, after modifying the report of the Referee, accepted it as modified. After further consideration, the Superior Court Justice entered an amended order purporting to dismiss Count II of the complaint and the third-party complaint.</p>
    <p id="b802-9" data-blocks='[["BL_802.9",802,[210,1605,745,86]]]'>The original order signed by the Presiding Justice read as follows:</p>

      <em>It is ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that the° Referee’s Report is hereby modified to state as a finding of fact that in addition to the sum of $11,-262.25 which the Defendant Silsbys admit they are indebted to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff is entitled to $6,000.00 due him because the excavated fill could not be used for backfill and that new gravel backfill had to be provided. This finding is consistent with the evidence adduced. As modified, the Court hereby accepts and enters JUDGMENT on the Report of the Referee.</em>
