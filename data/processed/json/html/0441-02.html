When the matter proceeded to trial before a jury, all parties agreed that the court, not the jury, would decide the issue of respondent’s liability as surety, as it was purely a question of law involving the applicable statute of limitations.

Respondent asserts that prior to <em>Anonymous Attorney A, </em>a violation of RPC 8.4(c) was found only where the misstatement was knowingly made and thus, the addition of recklessness as an alternative element of the violation created a fundamental change in the law. In respondent’s view he was without notice at the time he made the statements at issue that such conduct would be sanc-tionable under the RPC. As to the question of notice, the record reflects that during the hearing in this case, Disciplinary Counsel argued that respondent’s conduct was reckless. (Reproduced Record, hereinafter “RR” p. 166). Respondent was aware that Disciplinary Counsel believed a violation of RPC 8.4(c) could be sustained on a finding of reckless conduct.

Respondent asserts that <em>Price </em>is inapplicable as the conduct at issue in that case involved violations of RPC 3.3(a) and 8.2(b), which prohibit a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement; thus, the element of scienter therein is intentional. Whereas, the charges at issue in the instant case relate to RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer from knowingly or recklessly making a statement in ignorance of the truth or falsity thereof. By adding the element of recklessness, respondent argues that something less than intentional conduct is at issue, and thus, a lesser burden should be placed upon the attorney in supporting his basis for making the allegations. Respondent argues that a subjective standard is more appropriate to a determination of whether or not a lawyer acted in a reckless manner as it focuses on the actions of the individual charged rather than looking at the conduct through the eyes of an ordinary reasonable lawyer.</p>

Just as the law measures liability against the standard of the reasonable man, so do the rules of disciplinary conduct measure the ethical behavior of the members of the bar by the standard of the reasonable lawyer.

Dissatisfied with the decision of JIRB in the Larsen matter, respondent pursued other avenues in an effort to bring about the removal of Justice Larsen.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Thereafter, respondent utilized the media to widely disseminate his personal views on the need for judicial reform in Pennsylvania, along with his personal criticisms of various members of the statewide judiciary. Respondent believes that since his unsuccessful attempt to have Justice Larsen removed from office, and because of his well known public views on the subject of judicial reform in Pennsylvania, he has created powerful political and judicial enemies who have united in an effort to bring about his destruction. Thus, respondent believes he is a champion of justice and that every setback he suffers in the legal arena is a direct result of a conspiracy to suppress his views on judicial reform. From this negative view of the justice system, respondent brought forth his allegations against Judge Bradley and Judge Olszewski.</p>

Respondent avers that Justice Larsen had formed an alliance with the Republican Party in Delaware County. This averment is premised on respondent’s belief that Justice Larsen promised to have the Democratic Party of Allegheny County support Judge McEwen, a Delaware County republican, in the next election for a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in exchange for the Republican Party endorsement of Justice Larsen in the 1987 retention election. (RR p. 420^424). According to respondent, he has an unpleasant relationship with the Republican Party of De<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>laware County. Charles Sexton, a well-known figure in the Delaware County Republican Party, bears great personal animosity towards respondent. (RR p. 413). Judge Bradley is a close associate of Mr. Sexton. (RR p. 413). Respondent asserts that the day the case of <em>Leedom v. Spano </em>was sent to the jury he and his counsel were assured that a directed verdict would be entered in his favor. (RR p. 415). When respondent received the notice that a verdict had been entered against him, and then discovered that his post-trial motions were denied without an opportunity to present oral argument, he was left with the only conclusion possible, that the case had been “fixed”. (RR p. 422).</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[166,1095,752,786]]]'>There are certain verifiable facts contained within respondent’s account of the events leading to his conclusion concerning Judge Bradley. The Republican Party of Delaware County did endorse Justice Larsen in the retention election of 1987. (RR p. 420). Judge Bradley testified that he has known Charles Sexton since the 1970’s. (RR p. 68). The record establishes that a verdict was entered against respondent and his spouse following a decision by Judge Bradley on the motion to dismiss in the case of <em>Leedom v. Spano </em>and that no oral argument was heard on respondent’s post-trial motions. (RR, exhibits PI and P2).</p>

According to the depositions of the other attorneys present during the discussion of respondent’s motion to dismiss in Leedom <em>v. Spano, </em>Judge Bradley agreed to take the motion under advisement and enter a decision; he never agreed to rule in respondent’s favor. (RR exhibits P9 and P10). In fact respondent’s counsel in <em>Leedom v. Spano, </em>Mr. Rutter, testified that Judge Bradley never said he was ruling in respondent’s favor, only that he was taking the motion under advisement. (RR, p. 305). Mr. Rutter stated that it was his understanding that the motion would be decided in respondent’s favor. (RR, p. 278). As for oral argument on post-trial motions, Judge Bradley testified that he did not believe oral argument was necessary. (RR, p. 48). When testifying before the hearing committee, respondent argued that he was entitled to oral argument under Rule 211 of Pa.R.C.P. However, the record does not indicate that respondent sought oral argument.</p>
    <p id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[964,692,757,782]]]'>A de novo review of the record fails to uncover a reasonable basis for respondent’s accusation that Judge Bradley “fixed” the verdict in <em>Leedom v. Spano. </em>Rather we find that respondent took unrelated facts and hooked them together by conjecture. It is inconceivable as to how these unrelated events establish a reasonable basis for respondent’s assertion that Judge Bradley entered a decision adverse to respondent because the case was “fixed”. An attorney proceeds recklessly when he presents assertions without any indicia of the accuracy of those assertions, or without a minimal effort to investigate the accuracy thereof.</p>

Respondent’s personal views on judicial reform cannot excuse his reckless conduct in bringing unsubstantiated accusations against individual members of the judiciary. The accusations against Judge Bradley were made with reckless ignorance of the truth or falsity thereof. The recommendation of the Disciplinary Board is rejected as to Judge Bradley as we find that a violation of RPC 8.4(c) was established by clear and satisfactory evidence.</p>

Levy. </em>Once again, respondent relies upon his historically acrimonious relationship with former Justice Larsen. The accusations concerning Judge Olszewski <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>arose through the benefit of hindsight. Respondent sets the stage by presenting the testimony of attorney Samuel Klein regarding a conversation Mr. Klein had with Judge Olszewski in February of 1986. (RR p. 338). Mr. Klein encountered Judge Olszewski by chance, the meeting occurred either in front of the Pittsburgh courthouse, or at the Pittsburgh Airport. (RR p. 340). The conversation concerned respondent’s attack on Justice Larsen and the JIRB process. Judge Olszewski indicated a distaste for respondent’s methods and comments as inappropriate, and stated “he had no time for the likes of Bob Sur-rick”. (RR p. 343). Mr. Klein reported Judge Olszewski’s remarks to respondent. (RR p. 489).</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[174,1150,754,589]]]'>As fate would have it, in 1986 Judge Olszewski was a member of the Superior Court panel that heard respondent’s appeal in <em>Surrick v. Surrick, </em>wherein respondent contested the amount of spousal support awarded to his estranged wife. The record reflects that a memorandum decision was issued by that panel denying respondent relief.' (RR, exhibit R24). Respondent affixes blame to Judge Olszewski for what he considers an incorrect ruling in the support case. (RR p. 488).</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[169,1762,756,989]]]'>Judge Olszewski was on a panel of the Superior Court that on January 27, 1987 rendered the memorandum decision in the case of <em>Surrick v. Levy. </em>(RR p. 77). That litigation preceded the action in <em>Leedom v. Spano, </em>and involved a financial dispute over the dissolution of respondent’s law practice with Mr. Levy. (RR p. 208). When the litigation reached the Superior Court, the decision of the trial court in favor of Mr. Levy was affirmed. (RR exhibit. R15). The Superior Court in a memorandum opinion found that the issues raised by respondent had not been properly preserved for review, and thus, consideration on the merits was precluded. (RR exhibit R15 p. 3). Respondent argues that the decision by the Superior Court in <em>Surrick v. Levy </em>was improper and incorrect. (RR p. 226).</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[978,242,753,737]]]'>Then in 1991 Judge Olszewski authored a concurring and dissenting opinion in the case of <em>Larsen v. Philadelphia Newspapers. </em>(RR exhibit R26). Respondent was a named defendant in that defamation action. Respondent had been dismissed from the case by the trial court’s order on a motion for summary judgment. The concurring and dissenting opinion by Judge Olszewski opined that summary judgment as to respondent should not have been entered on all counts of the complaint. Respondent deduces that Judge Olszewski’s opinion reveals a dislike for respondent. (RR p. 488).</p>

Respondent theorizes that Judge Olszew-ski was aging and would most likely seek senior status upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. Senior status is accomplished by appointment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Justice Larsen, as a -member of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had control over Judge Olszewski’s future. (RR p. 488). Respondent threads these assertions together and concludes that the only reasonable explanation for the decision in <em>Surrick v. Levy </em>was that Judge Olszewski fixed the case in order to curry favor with Justice Larsen and obtain an appointment to senior status. (RR p. 488).</p>

Respondent views the court system through the warped lens of his vitriolic battle against former Justice Larsen. Respondent’s accusations against Judge Olszewski resulted not from a reasoned deduction based upon objective facts, but rather from personal inability to accept any judicial decision adverse to him. In other words, if respondent does not prevail in a legal matter that <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>ruling is ipso facto an example of the grand conspiracy created by former Justice Larsen to destroy respondent.

Disciplinary Counsel has asked that at a minimum, respondent be subjected to a public censure. We do not find that public censure would be sufficient to address the measure of respondent’s wrongful conduct. Although we have concluded that respondent acted recklessly rather than intentionally in this matter, the impact upon Judge Bradley, Judge Olszewski and the judicial system as a whole is the same. As we noted in <em>Price, </em>“the damage done to one’s reputation by the assertion of slanderous allegations is irreparable.” <em>Id. </em>at 604. Respondent’s predilection to unprovoked character assassination whenever he receives an adverse ruling exhibits conduct that is clearly unprofessional and calls into question his ability to continue practicing law in a fit manner. Respondent, in preference for his personal conspiracy theories, recklessly and carelessly disregarded the truth when he called into question the integrity of the judicial system by declaring that the system is subject to the whim and manipulation of one person. Respondent’s conduct was inexcusable and unprofessional. His defense of this conduct does not allay our concerns with his fitness to practice law; rather, it arouses them.</p>

An accusation of judicial impropriety is not a matter to be taken frivolously. An attorney bringing such an accusation has an obligation to obtain some minimal factual support before leveling charges that carry explosive repercussions. When an attorney makes an accusation of judicial impropriety without first undertaking a reasonable investigation of the truth of that accusation, he injures the public, which depends upon the unbiased integrity of the judiciary, the profession itself, whose coin of the realm is their ability to rely upon the honesty of each other in their daily endeavors, and the courts, who must retain the respect of the public and the profession in order to function as the arbiter of justice. “Truth is the cornerstone of the judicial system; a license to practice law requires allegiance and fidelity to truth.” <em>Grigsby, </em><a href="/pa/493/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="493 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="8731796" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0194-01">425 A.2d at 733</a>.
