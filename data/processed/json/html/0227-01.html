    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[202,501,751,712]]]'>In this appeal, we are faced with the question of how to define 75 Pa.Cons.Stat. Ann. § 3738(a.2)(2)(iii), a subsection that increases the penalty for fleeing or eluding a police officer in a way that endangers the officer or the public. Appellant, R.C.Y., a minor, appeals from his juvenile disposition under this subsection, contending that his conduct did not meet the requirement of a “high-speed chase.” We conclude that intent of the subsection is to protect law enforcement personnel and the public from dangerous chases, regardless of the actual speed employed. Therefore, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.7",266,[202,1240,748,402]]]'>On December 8, 2009, Appellant stole his uncle’s Honda Civic, which was unregistered and uninsured at the time. Appellant did not have a valid driver’s license at the time; rather, he had a learner’s permit. He drove the vehicle to his girlfriend’s house where he remained until approximately 2:00 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b266-7" data-blocks='[["BL_266.8",266,[201,1669,750,505]]]'>At that time, Appellant left his girlfriend’s house to give his friend a ride home. Officer Jeremy Horton of the Sayre Borough Police Department observed Appellant ignore a stop sign and drive through an intersection without stopping. Officer Horton immediately began to follow Appellant, and at the next intersection, he observed Appellant signal for a right turn but turn left.</p>

Appellant proceeded to run through five more stop signs, as well as drive through a yard and over a small tree. Shortly thereafter, Officer Sean Flynn, also of the Sayre Borough Police Department, joined the pursuit. Appellant attempted to avoid the pursuit by pulling into a parking lot, but succeeded only in stranding his vehicle in snow on the grass berm.</p>

Unfortunately, Appellant failed to abandon his flight, and continued to rev his engine and spin his wheels in the snow. At one point, Appellant’s vehicle regained traction, and Appellant proceeded to back the vehicle into Officer Horton’s squad car. After striking Officer Horton’s vehicle, Appellant pulled forward and struck Officer Flynn, pinning his leg between the Appellant’s vehicle and Officer Flynn’s squad car and pushing him onto the hood.</p>
    <p id="b266-12" data-blocks='[["BL_266.12",266,[1000,1150,751,1023]]]'>Appellant, still attempting to flee, continued to rev his engine. Officer Horton, in a desperate attempt to end the chase, managed to break the driver’s side window in the Appellant’s vehicle. Appellant gained enough traction to pull his vehicle through an adjoining parking lot, leaving Officer Horton behind. Officer Flynn, after recovering from being hit by Appellant’s vehicle, was in a position to reach into the vehicle through the window that had been broken by Officer Horton. He reached in and attempted to turn off the vehicle. Undaunted, Appellant continued to drive while Officer Flynn was reaching through the window. Eventually, Appellant gained enough speed so that Officer Flynn had difficulty keeping up. Ultimately, Officer Flynn had to roll away from the vehicle to avoid being run over.</p>

Appellant contends that the juvenile court erred in grading the fleeing and eluding charge as a third degree felony. Specifically, Appellant argues that section 3733(a.2)(2)(iii) cannot apply unless the defendant travels at an excessive speed. As a result, Appellant argues, the fact that the evidence at the delinquency hearing established that he traveled no faster than 35 m.p.h. during the chase precludes application of section 3733(a)(2)(iii).

First, that the legislature intended the enhanced penalties to protect the safety of the public in general and police officers in particular. Indeed, the first clause of the subsection is “endangers a law enforcement officer or member of the general public.... ” Clearly, the “mischief to be remedied” is the danger presented by certain methods of fleeing or eluding police officers while driving a motor vehicle at high speeds.</p>
    <p id="b268-19" data-blocks='[["BL_268.20",268,[1009,1427,753,922]]]'>Second, we conclude that the legislature did not intend for the term “high-speed chase” to be construed literally. Rather, it intended that “high-speed chase” be a term of art, having a practical, legal meaning that was not closely bound by a literal definition. The term “high-speed chase,” far from being the primary focus of the subsection, was intended to merely require a different level of danger from the run-of-the-mill dangers posed by merely failing to stop when signaled to do so by a police officer. In other words, the legislature included this term to indicate that the enhanced penalties applied only in cases where the defendant’s actions created an extraordinary danger to the public at large or to police officers.</p>

Appellant endangered Officer Flynn not only by <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>hitting Officer Flynn with his vehicle, but also by continuing to accelerate while Officer Flynn was reaching into the vehicle. Officer Flynn testified that when he finally disengaged himself from Appellant’s vehicle, he feared that he would fall under the wheels of the vehicle as Appellant accelerated away. Based upon these circumstances, we conclude that Appellant endangered Officer Flynn due to the use of driving tactics that were anything but a run-of-the-mill failure to stop. Accordingly, the juvenile court correctly graded Appellant’s adjudication of delinquency. Appellant’s issue on appeal therefore merits no relief.</p>

    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[204,1521,752,486]]]'>I agree with the majority that in enacting the grading enhancement, the legislative intended to remedy a mischief of the danger to police officers and the public posed by drivers who attempt to flee or elude police at high speeds. It is also clear that the legislature did not affix a minimum numerical rate of speed, but instead allowed for court interpretation of the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

The terms “high-speed” and “chase” have common, usual meanings that should be employed in the statute. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1903(a)-(b), 1921(a)-(b). Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “chase” in part as: “the act of pursuing for the purpose of seizing, capturing, molesting, doing violence, or killing.” WebsteR’s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged 379 (1971). “High-speed” is defined in part as: “operated or adapted for operation at high speed.” <em>Id. </em>1069.</p>
    <p id="b270-9" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[1003,504,751,791]]]'>Furthermore, in adding the modifier “high speed” to the term “chase,” the legislature intended to address not all chases that pose danger to officers or the public, but specifically chases at high rates of speed. I disagree with the majority’s characterization of the term “high-speed chase” as “far from being the primary focus of the subsection.” Instead, the factor of a “high speed chase” is of equal importance to, and a distinct element to be established from, the danger posed to an officer or member of the public. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) (“Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.”).</p>
    <p id="b270-10" data-blocks='[["BL_270.9",270,[1001,1318,752,1046]]]'>In the instant matter, the trial court found that the speed of the chase was thirty to thirty-five miles per hour. Trial Ct. Op. at 4. The court reasoned that section 3733(a.2)(2)(iii)’s term “high-speed chase” is relative. For the reasons discussed above, I would disagree, and I would apply the usual and common meanings of the words “high-speed” and “chase.” The court further noted that Appellant was not a licensed driver, the streets were snow-covered and slippery, the tires on Appellant’s car were “bald,” and that Appellant drove through stop signs and was unable to negotiate turns. <em>Id. </em>It is clear that Appellant’s actions in driving the vehicle posed great danger to Officers Horton and Flynn. Nevertheless, I would find that the unrelated question of whether there was a high-speed chase should be answered in the negative.</p>
