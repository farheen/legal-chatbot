Kristine filed a motion with the district court to modify the child support award contending that the $450 amount was not in conformity with the statutory formula in light of the fact that Randy earns approximately $6,000 per month. Kristine asserted that according to the statutory formula, Randy should pay $1,132.66 per month. After further briefing and a hearing, the district court modified the child support award from $450 to $1,000 per month.</p>

We conclude that Randy’s argument lacks merit. While it is true that Kristine did seek relief under NRCP 60(b), the district court did not modify the child support award pursuant to NRCP 60(b). Kristine’s motion is properly construed as a motion to modify child support pursuant to NRS 125B.145(l)(b). NRS 125B.145(l)(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>

We note that the cases in which this court affirmed the district court’s deviation from the statutory formula turned on the district court’s specific findings of fact. Herz v.

The district court originally ordered Sandra to pay $125 per month in child support. Upon Robert’s motion, the domestic relations referee recommended a modification of the child support award on the ground that Sandra had a community interest in her new spouse’s income. The referee recommended an increase in Sandra’s payments to $247 per month finding that this amount was 18 percent of her gross monthly income, which included her community interest in her spouse’s gross monthly income.
