Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion of Centennial. Such action, in effect, rejected Arnica’s argument for stacking the uninsured-motorist-insurance coverage on the eleven vehicles insured under Centennial’s fleet policy. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the Superior Court judgment in favor of Centennial on its cross-claim against codefendant Arnica and in favor of Centennial on eode-fendant Arnica’s cross-claim.</p>

In that case plaintiff sought a determination of which defendant, Centennial or Arnica, should compensate him for damages he sustained as a result of an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist. The accident occurred in Providence on October 7,1988, while plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle owned by Lumb Leasing Corporation and leased to plaintiff’s employer, Harieomp, Inc. The collision was caused by the negligence of the uninsured motorist. As a result of this motor-vehicle accident, plaintiff sustained personal injuries, lost wages, and incurred medical expenses exceeding $50,000.</p>

In response to plaintiffs demand, Arnica contended that the uninsured-motorist benefits of plaintiffs employer’s Centennial policy must be stacked in accordance with G.L.1956 (1989 Reenactment) § 27-7-2.1(0, the Rhode Island stacking statute, thus creating a pool of $550,000 (instead of $50,000 as asserted by Centennial).

      <em>Cantley </em>lends significant support to the proposition that the stacking statute is to be read narrowly, benefiting only the premium-paying insured. The plaintiff in this case is an insured only by virtue of his occupancy of one vehicle out of his employer’s fleet of eleven vehicles. He did not pay the premium for the uninsured-motorist coverage provided by Centennial. By virtue of these two important facts, plaintiff does not fall within the express terms of the stacking statute: “an insured [who] has paid two (2) or more separate premiums” for uninsured-motorist coverage.

Quite clearly, it would be tremendously costly and counterproductive to allow the stacking of fleet uninsured-motorist benefits. Here a total of eleven vehicles were insured. If Arnica’s contentions were to prevail, the application of basic mathematics would result <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>in an exposure of $550,000 for each vehicle (eleven times $50,000) and Centennial’s total exposure would be $6,050,000 (eleven times $550,000). All this coverage would be available for the price of a mere $12 per vehicle premium or $182. This is precisely the type of absurd result anticipated by this court in <em>Taft v. Cerwonka, </em><a href="/a2d/433/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="433 A.2d 215" data-case-ids="7974933" data-case-paths="/a2d/433/0215-01">433 A.2d 215</a>, 218 (R.I.1981). We cannot permit such an absurdity to occur.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[187,728,754,563]]]'>Furthermore, to adopt stacking for a class-II insured under a commercial-fleet policy would be to reach an unreasonable and completely unexpected result. We therefore hold that, because the plaintiff was an insured only when occupying an insured vehicle of his employer, he cannot claim any right to stacking. The plaintiffs recovery under the Centennial policy is limited to the $50,000 primary coverage applicable to the vehicle he was operating. Arnica is responsible for any excess coverage.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[189,1319,751,222]]]'>For the reasons stated above, Arnica’s appeal is denied and dismissed, the judgments appealed from are affirmed, and the papers of the ease are remanded to the Superior Court.</p>
