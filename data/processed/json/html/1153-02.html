For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b1226-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1226.7",1226,[199,944,758,1282]]]'>Undercover State Trooper Richard Ealing was investigating unrelated drug trafficking when he was introduced to appellant. Appellant was being harassed by her ex-boyfriend, Richard Reinhardt, and asked Ealing to help her resolve the problem. As a result of appellant’s request, Ealing obtained permission from Assistant District Attorney Paul Skirtich, pursuant to the Wiretap Act, to record telephone and face-to-face conversations between himself and appellant. Thereafter, appellant agreed to pay Ealing $10,-000.00 to murder Reinhardt, and further agreed to pay Ealing an additional $5,000.00 upon collection of insurance money she would receive as the beneficiary of Reinhardt’s life insurance policies. Appellant and Ealing spoke several more times in order to refine the contract, and appellant provided Ealing with Reinhardt’s photograph and other relevant information. Ultimately appellant agreed to pay Ealing $23,000.00 to kill Reinhardt in a manner which would allow her to collect the insurance money. Thereafter, Ealing arrested appellant for criminal solicitation to commit homicide and criminal conspiracy <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to commit homicide.</p>

At trial, Ealing testified and the Commonwealth also offered the audiotaped conversations between Ealing and appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant relied on the battered women syndrome defense, presenting the expert testimony of Robert Wettstein, Ph.D, and family members who testified to Reinhardt’s abuse. After two days of testimony, the Honorable David R. Cashman found appellant guilty of both charges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Post-trial motions were denied, and on June 7,1993, appellant was sentenced to two (2) to four (4) years imprisonment. After sentencing, appellant’s trial counsel was permitted to withdraw from the case, but new counsel was not appointed until after the expiration of the thirty-day appeal period. Appellant’s new counsel filed a petition for reinstatement of appellate rights <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>which was granted October 4,1993. This appeal is now properly before us.</p>
