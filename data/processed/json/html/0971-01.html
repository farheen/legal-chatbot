Haws and its assignees to registration of the trade-mark “ Panhard.” True it is that in the case at bar the question is as to the right of appellant’s assignor to register it in 1913, while in the opposition proceeding the question was as to the right of appellant, as the assignee of the firm of George A. Haws, to register it in 1922. But appellant’s claim to registration in 1922 was predicated upon its claim to ownership by assignment of registration No. 90329, and the ownership and use by appellant’s assignor of said mark prior to 1913. Appellant’s answer to the notice of opposition treats ■ its application as one to <em>reregister </em>the trademark No. 90329, and it alleges a prior adjudication of the ownership of said mark by its assignor in an action brought in 1907 against a licensee of appellee. It is noted that it is alleged in the answer to the notice of opposition that the judgment in that action, which is relied upon as <em>res adjwdicaita </em>of the issues there involved, was rendered in 1909, four years before the registration No. 90329 was secured by appellant’s assignor.</p>

The decision was upon the merits, upon testimony-taken by the opposer. No appeal was taken from such decision. As we have already observed, the mere fact that the remedy sought in the case at bar is affirmative relief, cancellation of registration No. 90329, while in opposition No. 4617 the remedy sought was denial of reregistration of registration No. 90329, can not in any way prevent the application of the doctrine of <em>res adjudicaba.</em>

Thereafter, certain other affidavits and exhibits were filed by appellant in the Patent Office. On March 11, 1929, the Commissioner of Patents rendered a decision holding in .abeyance the final disposition of said petition until the decision of this court shall be rendered in the case at bar.
