The Tax Appeal Board (“Board”) ruled that the appellant, Arbern-Wilming-ton, Inc. (“Arbern”), was not subject to the contractor tax nor was it required to secure an occupational license. On appeal by the Director of the State Division of Revenue (the “Director”), the Superior Court affirmed the Board's ruling that Arbern could not be deemed a contractor but ruled that Arbern was subject to the occupational tax.

The Superior Court reasoned that if the court in the <em>City of Phoenix </em>determined that the taxpayer did not fall within the purview of the Phoenix City Code, then clearly the taxpayer in the present case was not a contractor under the more restrictive language of the Delaware statute.

It argues that the adjective “service” modifies all four of the nouns following it and that the statute therefore applies only to persons holding themselves out to the public as being engaged in some service-oriented business. The Director counters that such a reading would be unnatural because, while the term “industry” is commonly used with a descriptive modifier such as “service”, the words “business” and “calling” are not.

We, therefore, begin by analyzing the several subsections of Section 2301 itself. It is clear from the outset that subsections (a) and (b) are closely related provisions. Subsection (b) is a catch-all provision designed to expand the scope of the statute beyond what is specified in subsection (a). The issue, then, is how far subsection (b) expands that scope. We believe that construing the statute so that it applies to all those holding themselves out as being in any business expands subsection (b) to a point where it eclipses subsection (a), rendering most of subsection (a) unnecessary. Of the 91 occupations contained in subsection (a), 78 are levied a fee of $50. Yet, under the Superior Court’s interpretation, if these occupations were not included in (a), they would still be subject to the same $50 fee under (b). Such a reading makes those 78 paragraphs of subsection (a) superfluous. A statute will not be construed in such a way that part of it becomes surplusage if there is another reasonable construction available. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Graham, Del</em>.Supr., <a href="/a2d/451/0832-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="451 A.2d 832" data-case-ids="7974202" data-case-paths="/a2d/451/0832-01">451 A.2d 832</a> (1982).</p>
    <p id="b1456-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1456.9",1456,[1011,1068,747,133]]]'>A broad reading of subsection (b) would also produce a strained reading of subsection (c)(1), which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1456-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1456.10",1456,[1046,1216,710,372]]]'>Any person licensed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section whose business activity or operation <em>is not limited to the rendition of services </em>for other persons <em>but also </em>involves the sale or exchange of goods or personal property shall also be subject to [Chapter 29].

    <p id="b1456-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1456.11",1456,[1006,1608,750,658]]]'>If subsection (b) applies to any type of business, there is no reason to define the scope of subsection (c) negatively. If the legislative intent was to single out businesses that provide both services and goods, it could have done so in much simpler language. Moreover, in normal usage, the emphasized portion of subsection (c)(1) implies that subsections (a) and (b) apply only to businesses that provide services. We are required to give the words of a statute their normal meaning. 1 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 303. <em>Kofron v.

    <p id="b1456-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1456.12",1456,[1003,2288,748,421]]]'>Finally, we note that subsection (b) itself purports to apply a “general <em>service </em>license fee”, not just a general license fee. We must assume the legislature intended every word in the statute to carry some meaning. <em>In re Estate of Webb, </em>Del.Ch., <a href="/a2d/269/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="269 A.2d 413" data-case-ids="8068026" data-case-paths="/a2d/269/0413-01">269 A.2d 413</a> (1970).

It is clear that section 2301(b), when construed in conjunction with other provisions of section 2301, was intended to apply only to service-oriented occupations. Subsection (a) contains a list consisting almost entirely of service-oriented occupations. Subsection (b) applies the general <em>service </em>license fee and subsection (c) implies that subsections (a) and (b) apply only to service occupations.</p>

Arbern is in the business of selling condominiums. Condominiums are for all purposes considered real property. 25 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2204. On each occasion when Arbern sold a condominium, it was subject to all taxes applied to the transfer of realty, including the Realty Transfer Tax of 30 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 5402. The Realty Transfer Tax is levied against any consideration received by the seller of real property. <em><a href="/a2d/556/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="556 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="7882089" data-case-paths="/a2d/556/0190-01">Id.</a> </em>The Occupational License Tax is levied against the aggregate gross receipts received by the taxpayer. 30 <em>Del.

By its terms, however, that subsection applies to any occupation subject to the license fee provisions of subsections (a) or (b).
