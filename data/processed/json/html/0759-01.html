    <p id="b798-19" data-blocks='[["BL_798.20",798,[994,745,751,1092]]]'>The case came before the trial court for entry of a plea of guilty to one charge pursuant to a plea bargain.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Upon request of the court, the government placed in the record a statement of the facts upon which the charge was based. As related in that statement, appellee approached a police officer at 3 :00 a. m. and inquired whether he wanted to “go out”. The officer replied that he did, and asked how much it would cost. Appellee then quoted a price of $25, stated “Let’s go,” and indicated to the officer that they should proceed to his room. The court refused to accept the plea,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> ruling that since the government had not alleged an explicit offer by appellee to perform a specific sex act, there was lacking an adequate factual basis for accepting ap-pellee’s plea of guilty. Recovering from his surprise at this turn of events, appel-lee’s counsel then announced that his client would withdraw her plea, and the case was certified back to Calendar Control Court.</p>

He therefore sought to reinstate the plea of guilty by his client he had earlier withdrawn. Whereupon the court, repeating the view of the necessity of proof of an offer to perform a specific sex act, dismissed <em>sua sponte both </em>charges for failure of the government to allege facts establishing probable cause.</p>
