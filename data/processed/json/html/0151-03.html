As we find this case controlled by the Court’s recent decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/547/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="547 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="468656" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0550-01">547 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/1018-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="692 A.2d 1018" data-case-ids="11919311,468656" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1018-01,/pa/547/0550-01">692 A.2d 1018</a> (1997), we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b210-15" data-blocks='[["BL_210.15",210,[1006,263,753,1129]]]'>On August 24, 1991, Anthony Cavalieri was shot to death in South Philadelphia, and the police suspected that Persiano was the killer. However, Persiano was not arrested or questioned about the murder, and the police continued to investigate. Nineteen months later, on January 15, 1993, at 11:17 a.m., Persiano was arrested on an unrelated weapons charge and transported to the major crimes unit of the Philadelphia police department for processing. After receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Persiano declined to make a statement on the charge. That afternoon, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Detective William Schol, the lead detective in the murder investigation, was notified of Persi-ano’s arrest. Although Detective Schol was in court on another matter at the time, he instructed that Persiano should be processed normally, like any other arrestee. Later that same day, at 6:00 p.m., Persiano was taken to the police administration building to be fingerprinted, photographed and arraigned.</p>
    <p id="b210-16" data-blocks='[["BL_210.16",210,[1007,1427,749,848]]]'>At 2:30 a.m. the next day, January 16, 1993, while Persiano was still in custody but not yet arraigned on the weapons charge, Detective Schol accompanied him from the detention area in the police administration building upstairs to the homicide unit for interrogation regarding the murder. At 4:55 a.m., after being told of the evidence implicating him in the murder, Persiano again received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and then confessed to the murder, concluding his statement to Detective Schol at 5:40 a.m. Thus, Persiano confessed to the murder approximately eighteen hours after he was taken into custody and before he was arraigned on the weapons charge, but only three hours after the initiation of custodial interrogation related to the Cavalieri killing.</p>

The trial court denied the motion. Thereafter, Persiano was <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>found guilty by a jury of first degree murder and was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b211-4" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[187,415,753,833]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, concluding that Persiano’s confession should have been suppressed under the <em>Davenport-Duncan </em>rule. The Superior Court reasoned that the trial court misinterpreted the rule by calculating the six-hour time period from when the interrogation regarding the murder began, rather than focusing on the time when Persiano was originally taken into custody on the unrelated weapons charge. The Superior Court held that, when an accused is in custody on unrelated charges and is not arraigned on those charges, any confession to a second crime given more than six hours after commencement of the initial confinement violates the six-hour rule and must be suppressed. Accordingly, Persiano was granted a new trial.</p>

Washington initially was arrested on a charge unrelated to these murders. While being processed on that charge, he was placed in a holding cell. Approximately twenty-eight hours after his initial arrest, he was taken to an interrogation room, questioned concerning the murders, and, within five hours from the start of questioning, gave an inculpatory statement, which ultimately was used against him at trial.</p>

In addressing this claim, the Court reviewed the development of the six-hour rule from its initial formulation in <em>Davenport, </em>which directed the focus of the rule to the timing of the arraignment, through its modification in <em>Duncan, </em>in which the relevant inquiry shifted to consideration of <em>“when </em>the [defendant’s] statement was obtained, i.e., within or beyond the six hour period.” <em>See Washington, </em><a href="/pa/547/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="547 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="468656" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0550-01">547 Pa. at 560</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/1018-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="692 A.2d 1018" data-case-ids="11919311,468656" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1018-01,/pa/547/0550-01">692 A.2d at 1022</a> (quoting <em>Duncan, </em><a href="/pa/514/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="514 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="1804597" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0395-01">514 Pa. at 406</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="514 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="1804597" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0395-01">525 A.2d at 1182</a>).

With these considerations in mind, and acknowledging that Washington had been subject to a prolonged period of detention prior to the homicide interrogation, the Court nevertheless declined to find a violation of the <em>Davenport-Duncan </em>rule, where the period of such pre-arraignment interrogation did not exceed six hours. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, <a href="/a2d/692/1018-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="692 A.2d 1018" data-case-ids="11919311,468656" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1018-01,/pa/547/0550-01">692 A.2d at 1022-23</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b211-11" data-blocks='[["BL_211.9",211,[985,1449,753,420]]]'>Here, as in <em>Washington, </em>following his arrest on the weapons charge, Persiano was detained in police custody for a substantial period of time prior to being questioned regarding the Cavalieri homicide, but confessed to the murder within three hours from the time such interrogation commenced. Thus, pursuant to <em>Washington, </em>the confession occurred within the pertinent six-hour period.</p>
    <p id="b211-12" data-blocks='[["BL_211.10",211,[984,1901,754,419]]]'>Persiano argues that the purpose of the <em>Davenport-Duncan </em>rule includes the protection against prolonged custodial detention prior to police interrogation, and that, after six hours of such detention, no confession for any crime can be deemed voluntary. As the Commonwealth points out, however, this Court rejected an almost identical argument in <em>Washington, </em>stating as follows:</p>

Appellant was arrested at 4:30 a.m. December 31, 1993 on an unrelated charge. While being processed on that charge, he was placed in a holding cell. Then, at 8:45 a.m. on January 1, 1994, he was taken to an interrogation room in the Police Administration Building, where he gave an inculpatory statement within approximately five hours from the start of questioning. On these facts, we decline to find a violation of the <em>Davenport-Duncan </em>rule, <em>which is premised on a desire to avoid the coercive effect of prolonged police interrogation.</em>
