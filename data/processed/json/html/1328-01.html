The condemning authority, the Delaware Department of Transportation (“State”), sought to acquire 59.0149 acres of land in New Castle County for the realignment of Delaware Route 7 (“Route 7”) and the construction of a regional interchange. The property owner, Frank E. Aciemo (“Aciemo”), contends that the amount awarded by the condemnation commissioners, $266,000, is grossly inadequate. He further complains that the trial judge erred in applying the correct valuation standard, in certain trial and evidentiary rulings, and in conducting inadequate <em>voir dire </em>questioning of the commissioners. We have carefully reviewed each of Aciemo’s claims and find them without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the condemnation award and judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

The property abuts the Christiana Mall, a regional shopping mall, to the north, and Route 7 to the east. When originally purchased, the property had a zoning classification of R-2, i.e., for agricultural and general purposes. This classification is considered a “holding category” for land for which the highest use or zoning classification has yet to be established. The <a id="p1330" href="#p1330" data-label="1330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1330</a>Christiana Metroform is a strong commercial and residential district and, as such, is one of the fastest growing areas in New Castle County.</p>
    <p id="b1396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1396.4",1396,[220,445,754,660]]]'>The increased traffic flow associated with commercial activity caused Route 7 eventually to become heavily congested and incapable of handling further development. As a result, the New Castle County Department of Planning began to design the eventual realignment of Route 7 from Interstate 95 to U.S. Route 13, with a major interchange at the Christiana Mall to alleviate the traffic flow problems in the area (“Highway Project”). The realigned Route 7 was designed as a four-lane highway and was to be constructed on the western part of the Acier-no/Marta property.</p>

On November 23, 1982, Acierno and Marta, in connection with the potential rezoning of their property, executed and recorded a Declaration of Restrictions (“Declaration”). The Declaration imposed several covenants on the property restricting its use in relation to the rezoning and Highway Project. The Declaration also provided that Acierno and Marta would donate to the State any land necessary for the realignment of Route 7, exclusive of any land necessary for the proposed interchange. The New Castle County Council approved the Marta/Aciemo rezoning. As approved, the ordinance divided the property into five separate parcels with the following zoning designations:</p>

The parties could not reach an agreement, however, because Acierno objected to the design and configuration of the interchange. On September 20, 1988, Acierno and Marta granted the State a right of entry onto their land to commence construction but the parties could not reach agreement on the donation. As a result, the State instituted the present condemnation proceeding in the Superior Court.</p>

The parties used September 20, 1988, as the date of the taking since that is the date Acierno and Marta granted the State a right of entry onto the land.</p>
    <p id="b1396-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1396.13",1396,[1021,1598,753,896]]]'>Prior to trial, the State filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>requesting the Superior Court to rule that Acierno and Marta had donated to the State all lands necessary for construction of the roadway and the interchange. Marta later entered into a settlement agreement with the State and was dismissed from the condemnation action. The Superior Court, in a pretrial ruling, found that Acierno manifested an unequivocal intent to donate the land required for the highway by executing the Declaration but that the parties had never reached a binding agreement to donate the remaining land for the interchange. In effect, the court ruled that Acierno’s donation was limited to the 18.0453 acres necessary to accommodate the realignment of Route 7, but that Acierno was entitled to be compensated for the remaining 41 acres.</p>

Robert H. MeKennon (“MeKennon”) originally appraised the property on behalf of the State. MeKennon val<a id="p1331" href="#p1331" data-label="1331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1331</a>ued the property as of October 24, 1988, but viewed its “before” value according to its pre-1982 zoning. McKennon disregarded the subsequent rezoning of Acierno’s property because he perceived that the new classifications were enhancements contingent on completion of the highway construction. McKennon opined that the Acierno property’s highest and best use after the taking was to be fully developed consistent with the rezoning and Highway Project. McKennon estimated the value before the taking to be $26,088,000 and the value after the taking to be $32,288,000, resulting in a condemnation award of zero.</p>

McKennon’s estimate that just compensation was zero was unaffected by the donation. The three residual parcels were valued by McKennon at $530,930, with Aciemo’s undivided one-half interest being $266,000.</p>

His appraisal report concluded that the highest and best use of the land before the taking was to leave the land vacant until significant improvements were performed on Route 7. Parker believed that the rezoning was contingent upon the Route 7 improvement because full development of the property would not be otherwise attainable. The appraisal report indicated that the highest and best use after the taking was development of the property as rezoned. Considering these factors, Parker estimated that the before taking value of the property was $9,000,000. The property after the taking, considering the rezoned parcels affected by the improvements of the Highway Project, was valued at $31,000,000, resulting in just compensation of zero.</p>

Harbeson indicated that, at the time of trial, the interchange adjacent to the Acierno land was not fully constructed in accordance with its original planned design. The Highway Project contemplated building a four-lane bridge across Route 7, with a ramp at its intersection with the interchange. Due to public opposition to extensive construction in an area without active commercial development, the bridge was constructed as a two-lane highway and the ramp was not built according to the final design. Harbeson testified that it was common for the State to construct such projects in phases and not to over-build in the first phase. He testified that the State was committed to constructing the additional improvements to the Highway Project in the future after Acierno began development of his property. He conceded that as currently built, the interchange cannot accommodate the full development of the Acierno property.</p>

He correctly states that compensation in a partial taking is determined by the “before and after” rule; that is, the eondemnee is entitled to the difference in market value of the property as a whole, before and unaffected by the taking, and the market value of the remaining property after and as affected by the taking. <em>Board of Education v.

Acierno argues that since the commissioners’ award coincides with the amount given by MeKennon in appraising the <em>pre-taking </em>fair market value of the three parcels of land in his supplemental report, the award does not conform to the standard. While this argument has facial appeal, it does not reflect the weight of evidence provided by MeKennon in his appraisal report and testimony.</p>

Subsequently, the State sought to separately appraise three residual parcels included in the larger property valued in McKennon’s original report. The State’s purpose in the supplemental appraisal was to compensate Acierno for these parcels <em>regardless of any set off benefits </em>because the residual parcels were not intended by the State to be included in the original Highway Project. Had the supplemental reports not been presented, Acierno would not have been entitled to any compensation because the original appraisal’s special benefits approach would have worked a complete set off. Therefore, Acierno’s argument on appeal that legal error was committed by the court allowing additional compensation evidence by the State does not support his ultimate claim of unjust compensation. Moreover, while Acierno did object to the introduction of MeKennon’s appraisal report at trial, the objection was couched in terms of the assumptions about zoning contained within the original report, not the valuation process for the residual parcels in the supplemental report. Having failed to <a id="p1335" href="#p1335" data-label="1335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1335</a>make a proper objection at trial, Acierno has waived it for purposes of appeal. <em>Wainwright v.

The Declaration executed by Acierno contained provisions restricting development of the Acierno property until after the State had accepted bids for the Highway Project. These bids were not advertised until 1990, more than a year after the date used for the taking. Moreover, there was testimony which indicated that full development of the Acierno property could not occur prior to the taking due to the congestion of then-existing Route 7 and Acierno’s lack of egress and ingress to that road. An appraisal may be premised upon assumptions which are proved by the testimony of other witnesses. <em>State v.
