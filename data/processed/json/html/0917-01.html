After a divorce trial held in 1997, the trial court entered an order granting the divorce and finalizing the distribution of property. Noting that both parties needed “to reestablish or develop careers and incomes,” the trial court order reserved Ms. Lake’s request for alimony for a later date “if the circumstances warrant[ed].” The following year, 1998, the trial court held a hearing on the issue of alimony and awarded alimony to Ms. Lake in the amount of $2,000 per month. At Mr. Lake’s request, the trial court vacated the original alimony order and issued an amended order reduc<a id="p919" href="#p919" data-label="919" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*919</a>ing the alimony to $1,000 per month. The trial court issued a further order in which it interpreted the initial order issued at the time of the divorce on property distribution requiring equal division of Mr. Lake’s severance payment, to mean equal division after payment of income taxes. Ms. Lake appeals from both the amended order reducing alimony to $1,000 per month and the order regarding after-tax distribution of the severance payment. With respect to the alimony award, she asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in the alimony calculation by overstating her earning capacity from employment, by improperly considering her potential investment income, and by underestimating Mr. Lake’s earning capacity. With respect to the ruling on the property distribution, she claims that the trial court erred in concluding that each party would receive an equal share after taxes. After reviewing the record, we conclude there is no abuse of discretion and affirm both the trial court’s alimony award and its distribution of Mr Lake’s severance pay on an after-tax basis.</p>

In October 1995, Mr. Lake resigned from his employment at Bozell after refusing an offer of immunity from the independent counsel’s office investigating improper political contributions which included pleading guilty to two misdemeanor counts of violating Federal elections law and a felony wire fraud count resulting from an improper $5,000 political contribution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Mr. Lake was subsequently convicted on all three counts and sentenced to pay a $150,000 fine, write a monograph to be distributed to political action committees and farmer’s cooperatives, and two years of probation. After resigning from his position, Mr. Lake terminated the monthly support payments to Ms. Lake. Mr. Lake was unemployed from October 1995 to May 1996, when he obtained a temporary consulting position with Burson-Marstel-ler, a global communications firm. After the first year, Mr. Lake became a full-time employee at a salary of $350,000 per year. He testified during the alimony trial that he did not anticipate receiving any significant increases in salary or bonuses from Burson-Marsteller.

See <em>supra </em>note 8. The court noted, however, that Ms. Lake’s net worth was substantial and that “proper management of her assets” should reduce her financial needs significantly. Ms. Lake does not contest the alimony court’s determination that her total net worth was $919,426.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Instead, she contends that it was inappropriate for the court to speculate about her anticipated earnings from these assets and to expect Ms. Lake to employ her net assets — either by invasion of principal or need for increased future earnings — for daily support. Although there was no direct testimony regarding Ms. Lake’s investment income, her counsel represented to the court that she had at least $250,000 in liquid assets currently available, of which a conservative five percent could reasonably be imputed as annual investment income. Therefore, the alimony court’s conclusion that Ms. Lake would be able to cover the $4,800 annual shortfall with the conceded $12,500 investment income from her liquid assets is supported in the record. Moreover, contrary to Ms. Lake’s claim, the $12,500 annual investment income would not require invasion into principal or increased future earnings. As Ms. Lake’s counsel stated, “[t]he stocks and the bank account are liquid and producing income.” <em>Cf Skiff, </em><a href="/a2d/277/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="277 A.2d 284" data-case-ids="8103057" data-case-paths="/a2d/277/0284-01">277 A.2d at 287</a> (holding that requesting spouse was not obliged to deplete inheritance for support where other spouse was able but refused to provide support).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> Although the court <a id="p925" href="#p925" data-label="925" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*925</a>noted generally that proper management of Ms. Lake’s substantial net worth would reduce her overall financial need, there is no evidence that it improperly calculated Ms. Lake’s alimony award based on a projected future return on assets greater than the actual return she was receiving at the time of the alimony trial. <em>Cf.

The trial court has broad authority to distribute property accumulated during marriage in any manner that is “equitable, just and reasonable.” D.C.Code § 16-910 (1997 Repl.) Under ornease law, “[a] trial court is granted considerable discretion in distributing marital property to parties to a divorce action.” <em>Bowser v.

Here, the alimony court found that it “would be inequitable for one party to pay all of the taxes on the severance payment.” Therefore, the court stated, the Lakes should retain an “equal share of the Bozell severance payment after the taxes are paid.” Upon review of the divorce court’s May 6, 1997, order, we find that the alimony court did not abuse its discretion in reaching this conclusion.</p>

However, a review of the 1997 order shows that the only time the divorce court held Mr. Lake solely responsible for payment of taxes on a particular asset was as a result of the parties’ stipulation prior to trial that Mr. Lake would pay all income taxes on the proceeds from the initial sale of Bozell stock. Moreover, even in this particular case, the divorce court expressly noted that the parties each bore his or her own tax liability for any capital gains taxes attributable to future stock distributions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a> The overall thrust of the order is that, except in specified circumstances, the parties were to share “net proceeds” equally.

While the divorce court did express its opinion that Mr. Lake would be able to regain his former annual income once he found employment, Mr. Lake was unemployed at the time of the divorce trial. The court’s opinion, therefore, was speculative and not based on fact.</p>
      <p id="AkQ" data-blocks='[["BL_959.9",959,[975,1609,720,680]]]'>At the alimony trial, Mr. Lake testified that he had regained employment, but his annual salary was $350,000. He also indicated that he did not expect to receive any significant salary increases or bonuses in the near future. Based on this testimony, and absent evidence that Mr. Lake’s current employment was of limited duration, the alimony court concluded that his earnings were likely to increase to $500,000 in succeeding years. Because the alimony court’s prospective income determination is supported by the evidence, we see no reason to disturb it on appeal.

This is likely because the payment was not dependent on continued employment with Bozell.</p>

        <em>. </em>Ms. Lake further argues that the language in the order holding Mr. Lake solely responsible for "the liabilities and debts directly related to the events leading to the termination of his employment” suggests that the court intended Mr. Lake to bear any adverse impact from leaving Bozell, including payment of taxes on the Bozell severance payment. Ms. Lake takes this language out of context, however, as earlier in the order the divorce court limited the above mentioned "liabilities and debts” to legal fees and fines related to his criminal convictions.</p>
