The Commonwealth Court reversed the judgment due to governmental immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8541-8564, holding that the “sidewalk exception,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(7), did not pierce the city’s immunity in this case. We granted allocatur to clarify precedents of this court relating to immunity, and to construe the language of the sidewalk exception to governmental immunity.</p>
    <p id="b1385-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1385.17",1385,[1002,467,753,659]]]'>This case arises from the following background. After dark on the evening of December 24, 1987, appellant was walking on the sidewalk adjacent to city-owned property on Vine Street in Philadelphia, when she slipped on an accumulation of grease. Her fall caused serious injury, and she brought a personal injury action against the city. The city raised the defense of governmental immunity under the tort claims act, moving for summary judgment, which was denied, and the case was tried on stipulated facts. Judgment was entered for appellant in the stipulated amount of $203,500.</p>
    <p id="b1385-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1385.18",1385,[1002,1158,756,325]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that an accumulation of grease on a sidewalk is not “a dangerous condition of sidewalks,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(7), the statutory requisite to circumventing the city’s governmental immunity and permitting tort liability.</p>
    <p id="b1385-19" data-blocks='[["BL_1385.19",1385,[1002,1512,762,752]]]'>The gist of appellant’s argument is that the greasy condition of the sidewalk which caused her injury is embraced within the statutory exception to the governmental immunity created by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act; she argues that in the language of the act, the grease constituted a dangerous condition of the sidewalk. It would be erroneous, in this view, to focus on the word “of,” in contradistinction to the word “on”; rather, the emphasis should be on “dangerous condition” and an analysis of what the legislature meant by that term. She relies heavily on <em>Bendas v. Township of White Deer, </em><a href="/pa/531/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="531 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1834381" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0180-01">531 Pa. 180</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="531 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1834381" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0180-01">611 A.2d 1184</a> (1992).</p>

The city argues that because grease does not derive or originate from the sidewalk, it is not a defect of the sidewalk itself; therefore, as a matter of law, grease cannot be considered a dangerous condition of the sidewalk. Hence it does not satisfy the statutory sidewalk exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity and the Commonwealth Court was correct in reversing the judgment against the city.</p>

Once again, all that is required for the exception to apply is a dangerous condition of the sidewalk of which the City possessed actual or constructive notice, and I conclude that few citizens of this Commonwealth would agree that grease on a sidewalk does not, <em>and can never, </em>constitute a dangerous condition of the sidewalk.</p>
