Appellant alleged that, with regard to his parole revocation hearing, Ms. Rafferty committed perjury, criminal conspiracy, and obstruction of justice when she testified, Ms. Nohe committed perjury, subornation of perjury, and obstruction of justice when she testified, and Attorney McCormack committed subornation of perjury, judicial corruption, obstruction of justice, criminal conspiracy, and false imprisonment when he prosecuted the case.</p>

        <em>. </em>We note that, in <em>Commonwealth v. Heckman, </em><a href="/a2d/928/1077-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="928 A.2d 1077" data-case-ids="8357497" data-case-paths="/a2d/928/1077-01">928 A.2d 1077</a> (Pa.Super.2007), the complainant pointed to inconsistencies between evidence offered at his criminal trial and evidence at the preliminary hearing, and therefrom, he extrapolated a conspiracy between the district attorney and police officer to use fabricated evidence to obtain his conviction. The trial court concluded the complainant’s criminal complaints were a backdoor attack on his convictions and found the district attorney had sound policy reasons for disapproving the complainant’s private criminal complaints. Such appears to be the case here.</p>
