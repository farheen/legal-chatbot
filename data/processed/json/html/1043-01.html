Brigham, Jr. (defendant) appealed to the Supreme Court from a judgment of conviction on two counts of first-degree sexual assault. The defendant was sentenced to thirty years on each count, to be served concurrently. On direct appeal the defendant challenged the admission of the testimony of the victim’s sister under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and also contested the legality of the sentence imposed. We affirm the conviction. A brief recitation of the pertinent facts follows.</p>

In 1986 Ann’s mother learned about the assaults, and confronted her husband with the allegations. The defendant admitted the offenses. The three family members had a meeting at which Ann agreed to work things out rather than subject her mother to a divorce. According to Ann’s testimony, at this 1986 meeting defendant apologized to her and assured her that he would never assault her again and did not. After staying with a friend for about a week, she moved back with her mother and stepfather in the hope that she could achieve a normal life. Ann did not report the abuse in 1986, but did so in November 1989 in a report to the Smithfield police.</p>

Nevertheless, at trial Betty testified to a three-year history of sexual abuse similar to that experienced by her older sister, Ann. According to defendant, Betty’s testimony concerning defendant’s sexual abuse of her was inadmissible under Rule 404(b) because the testimony amounted to evidence of prior misconduct or “other bad acts.” The trial justice, however, admitted Betty’s testimony under Rule 404(b), determining that her testimony was “reasonably necessary” to establish the elements of the state’s <em>prima facie </em>case against defendant.

Thus, because defendant raised the defense of consent, “it becomes part of the state’s burden to negate consent in order to prove that the sexual assault was committed with force or coercion.” <em>State v.

    <p id="b1100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1100.5",1100,[208,1502,757,1224]]]'>The state’s theory in the instant case was that defendant used his position as disciplinarian and head of the household to psychologically coerce Ann into the sexual acts. Betty’s testimony, in addition to detailing incidents of abuse similar to that experienced by her sister, described defendant’s relationship with his stepdaughters and verified defendant’s position as disciplinarian and head of the household. For example, Betty testified that defendant began to assert his interest in her when she turned to him for assistance with her homework. In addition, Betty identified defendant as being primarily in charge of disciplining her and her sister as they were growing up. Betty also described how her fear of her stepfather led her to believe she had no choice but to comply with his advances. Betty’s testimony therefore was highly relevant and probative of the degree of control, supervision, and discipline defendant exercised over his stepdaughters, <em>see Pignolet, </em><a href="/a2d/465/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="465 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="7949088" data-case-paths="/a2d/465/0176-01">465 A.2d at 181-82</a>, but was the testimony “reasonably necessary” to prove the state’s <em>prima facie </em>case? <em>See Tobin, </em><a href="/a2d/602/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="602 A.2d 528" data-case-ids="7937026" data-case-paths="/a2d/602/0528-01">602 A.2d at 532</a>.</p>

At the time the trial justice admitted Betty’s testimony, the burden was on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used force or coercion to commit the assaults. Beyond representations by defense counsel during a side-bar conference that defendant might not be testifying, defendant gave no indication of what evidence, if any, would be introduced to counter a claim of psychological coercion. At that point, Ann’s testimony was the sole source establishing coercion, and her testimony was impeached in part by her admission that she resented defendant for marrying her mother. Betty’s testimony, on the other hand, affirmed defendant’s position of authority and revealed that, prior to her mother’s marrying defendant, she loved defendant and thought “he was the greatest thing in the world.” Given these factors, it was not erroneous for the trial justice to conclude that Betty’s testimony was reasonably necessary to establish that defendant used psychological coercion in sexually assaulting Ann. Therefore, coupled with the proper limiting instruction, Betty’s testimony was properly admitted under Rule 404(b). <em>See Pignolet, </em><a href="/a2d/465/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="465 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="7949088" data-case-paths="/a2d/465/0176-01">465 A.2d at 182</a>.</p>
