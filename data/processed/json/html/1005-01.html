Appellant raises one question for our review, does the testimony of two police officers, discovered in a civil proceeding occurring after Appellant’s trial, indicating that the Commonwealth’s only eyewitness told them that he did not look at the robber’s face, that he only caught a glimpse of the robber, and that Appellant only resembled the robber, constitute after-discovered evidence sufficient to grant a new trial. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b1054-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1054.17",1054,[996,1144,752,1131]]]'>¶2 The facts relevant to the present appeal are:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant was arrested for armed robbery in the early morning hours of August 27, 1996. Bernard Hinton was walking on Willows Avenue near 51st Street in Philadelphia on his way home from work and had just purchased some Chinese food when he was approached by three black males. One of the men held a handgun to Mr. Hinton’s throat while the other two went through his pockets taking anything of value. The items taken from Mr. Hinton included the bag containing the Chinese food. The men left Mr. Hinton and began walking up 51st Street. In turn, Mr. Hinton made his way to a nearby fire station where he found police officers Jimmy Brown and Bruce Wright. Mr. Hinton gave the officers a description of the robbers. Of the gunman, he described the assailant as a heavy set male, approximately 5'8", and wearing a red t-shirt.</p>

Upon reaching the corner of 51st and Willows, Officer Brown observed three males down the street walking away from him. As the officers turned to follow the three males, the suspects became aware of the police vehicle and began running in the opposite direction. The officers pursued and then joined up with other responding officers to comb both Willows Avenue and Pentridge Street, which runs parallel to Willows, between 50th and 51st streets, as well as an alleyway. At least two individuals were apprehended as suspects in the robbery.</p>

Officer Jones was aware that a bag containing food had been taken from Mr. Hinton and as he approached, he believed he could smell food. Officer Jones began rummaging around the porch whereupon a black male located across the street interrupted him and asked what he was doing indicating that that was the house where he resided. Officer Jones then asked Appellant if the brown bag was his. Appellant responded affirmatively, at which point Officer Jones asked Appellant what were the contents of the bag, however, Appellant was unable to describe the contents of the bag. Asked why, Appellant responded that someone had purchased the food for him and dropped it off on the porch. Soon thereafter, Mr. Hinton arrived on the scene. When asked what the contents of the bag taken from him were, Mr. Hinton accurately described the contents of the bag found on the porch. Mr. Hinton also indicated that Appellant was the man that had held the gun to his throat even though Appellant was wearing a white shirt. An additional search of the porch resulted in the discovery of a red shirt with a gun wrapped in it. Mr. Hinton further indicated that the shirt was the one worn by the gunman and that the gun found on the porch was the one that had been held to his throat.</p>
    <p id="b1055-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.7",1055,[903,487,753,714]]]'>¶ 5 Appellant was tried twice on a variety of charges stemming from the robbery. The first trial ended in a mistrial on July 15, 1997, when the jury was unable to return a verdict. In the second, held in October 1997, Appellant was convicted. At trial, Mr. Hinton positively identified Appellant as the gunman without any sense of equivocation. Appellant was sentenced on October 29, 1998. His appeal to this Court resulted in affirmance on January 27, 2000. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the article, entitled “He Was Left Holding The Bag. Innocent Man Talked His Way Into Arrest For Armed Robbery,” Mr. Geringer was critical of the police investigation of the crime. In response to the article, Officer Albert Jones and Detective Brian Greivous sued the paper for defamation. During litigation of the defamation action, depositions were taken of several of the police officers who responded to the robbery or conducted the investigation. The depositions constitute the after-discovered evidence that are the basis of Appellant’s PCRA action. In these depositions, certain police officers indicated that Mr. Hinton told them that he was directed by the gunman not to look at him and that Mr. Hinton had only gotten a glimpse of the gunman.</p>

The petition was dismissed without a hearing on February 15, 2002. The present appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b1056-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.5",1056,[195,523,749,504]]]'>¶ 8 Appellant asserts that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of the after-discovered evidence.

On April 3, 1997, Ramsey gave an affidavit in which she stated that when Zahra Howard returned to school after the murder, she told Ramsey that she was not sure if the person she identified (Appellant) was the killer because she did not get a good look at the killer. Ramsey’s statement fails to meet at least two prongs of the after-discovered evidence test: the alleged conversation between Ramsey and Zahra Howard took place nearly a year before trial, and there is no evidence that it was discoverable only after trial; and the evidence would only be used to impeach Zahra Howard. Hence, this claim warrants no relief.</blockquote>

We acknowledge the scholarly discourse found in the Dissenting Opinion of our colleague Judge Klein on <em>Dennis, </em>the “four-prong test,” and precedent from which it originated and has been passed down.

        <em>Dennis </em>involved the same circumstances as here, a third-party statement that the key witness admitted off the witness stand that she did not get a good look at the perpetrator. Of course, this statement contradicted the actual trial testimony of the witness identifying the defendant as the perpetrator, which was unequivocal. Under these facts, the Supreme Court found that the statement failed to meet the after discovered evidence test for two reasons. First, there was no evidence that the statement was discoverable only after trial <em>and, </em>second, because the evidence would only be used to impeach the witness.</p>

Assume, for example, that a defendant is convicted of a robbery when the victim cannot make an identification, and the sole identification is made by a citizen who comes forth later to report that he witnessed the robbery and saw the defendant, whom he recognized. The witness identifies the defendant at trial. Suppose later it is discovered that this witness was an enemy of the defendant and in fact was a prisoner in an out-of-state jail at the time the robbery took place. Under the language of the rule as has been enunciated, this testimony about the witnesses’ jailing, proving that it was impossible for him to see what he said he saw, would not be enough to allow a new trial, absent some other prong being met. Since testimony about the incarceration would “be used solely for the purposes of impeachment,” this information would not be considered newly discovered evidence that justifies a new trial.</p>

Actually, Prong # 3 is almost always cited in addition to Prong #4, which denies a new trial where the evidence is not of such a nature and character that a different outcome is likely. However, a common sense approach is that in some cases, impeachment evidence is likely to change the result.</p>

The identification was so shaky that the jury could not agree in the first trial. The identification was positive in the second trial. It could be said that it is very likely that had the jury known that the victim said he was told not to look at the robber and only got a glance at him, the jury would have discounted his positive identification “without any sense of equivocation” at the second trial.</p>

However, this comes under Prong #4, that it would not change the verdict, rather than Prong #3, that it only goes to credibility. The Supreme Court noted that the trial judge had a hearing where he could evaluate the demeanor of the recanting witnesses and the reasons for their inconsistent statements. Noting that a new trial would have been necessary if the post-conviction court had believed the recantation, the Supreme Court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of a new trial, and The Supreme Court did not justify the denial of the new trial merely because the recantation only challenged the credibility of initial statements.</p>

When this Court affirmed the denial of a new trial, we cited three reasons: the evidence was for impeachment only, it was merely cumulative and related to an immaterial issue, and it would not probably result in a different verdict.
