Dauphin County Social Services for Children and Youth (“Dauphin CYS”) first became involved with B.L.W. in May 1998, when it received allegations that Mother and J.C.W., Sr. (“Father”), had engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with B.L.W., born September 23, 1992, and J.C.W., Jr., born March 26, 1984. Dauphin CYS sent a caseworker to conduct an unscheduled home visit on May 18, 1998. J.C.W., Jr. was on an overnight trip with his school. However, the caseworker spoke to B.L.W. who reported that Mother and Father had fondled her vagina, B.L.W. had fondled Father’s penis, and her par<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>ents engaged in sexual activity in the children’s presence.

Juvenile Court Summary, 6/9/98, at 1; N.T., 8/29/01, at 13. In addition, Dauphin CYS found a sound-activated tape recorder in the home’s only bathroom and quarter-sized holes in the bathroom wall that corresponded with holes in the parents’ bedroom wall. N.T., 8/29/01, at 9, 129-30. Dauphin CYS later determined that while family members used the bathroom, Father would record their activities and later would masturbate while listening to the recordings. On some occasions, he would directly observe family members in the bathroom by viewing them through the holes in the wall. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 12. As a result of the allegations of abuse and the conditions that caseworkers observed in the home, Dauphin CYS immediately placed B.L.W. in protective custody. N.T., 8/29/01, at 10.</p>

Juvenile Court Summary, 6/9/98, at 2; N.T., 8/29/01, at 13. Dauphin CYS immediately placed J.C.W., Jr. into shelter care. Mother informed Dauphin CYS that she and Father maintained a long-standing relationship with another couple with whom she and Father had an open sexual relationship, that Father engaged in sexual activity with the other woman in front of both Mother and the children, and that the other couple lived with Mother and her family at the time of the referral. N.T., 8/29/01, at 131. Mother knew that the male in the other couple had been convicted of possession of child pornography in 1987. N.T., 8/29/01, at 132. Mother also knew of the holes in the bathroom wall and the sexual activity that took place in front of the children, but she did not intervene to curtail the behavior. However, Mother denied fondling B.L.W. or witnessing anyone else fondle the child. She speculated that any inappropriate sexual touching involving B.L.W. likely would have been perpetrated by the other couple or Father.

A family reunification plan was put into place requiring Parents to: (1) undergo psychological evaluations and abide by any recommendations; (2) participate in therapy together regarding the roles and boundaries surrounding sexuality; (3) implement changes to repair the bathroom walls immediately; (4) clean and organize the living areas of the house and B.L.W.’s bedroom to allow for private areas; and (5) participate in STEP parenting classes. <em>Id. </em>Over the ensuing six months, Father failed to comply with the plan and left the home to live with his girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>at 13.

No “appropriate support” antieipatorily could have taught Mother the proper judgment required to choose not to engage in sexual intercourse in front of her children. Dr. Rosen made it clear that Mother’s disability is very difficult to remediate when novel situations arise. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The dissent intimates that after five years, Mother still could be referred for “appropriate support,” when Dr. Rosen’s testimony already has established such support cannot address Mother’s mental disability when novel situations arise.

The dissent suggests that there does not exist "a clear change of goal plan from which Mother could appeal,” dissent at 390, and it implies that we rely on the May 31, 2000 order attached to the Dauphin CYS brief as our support for the fact that the goal, indeed, was changed from reunification to adoption. As we do not have the juvenile court record before us, even though it was marked as an exhibit at trial, n.t., 8/29/01, at 13, we do not rely on this order. However, there is no doubt that the goal was changed to adoption. <em>See e.g., </em>N.T., 8/29/01, at 52, 54, 58. Moreover, Mother never raised any issue suggesting that the goal was not changed nor that she had been denied any right to appeal. In light of the fact that we do not have the certified record from the juvenile court, coupled with Mother’s failure to raise any issue concerning the reasonableness of the efforts toward reunification by Dauphin CYS in her Rule 1925(b) statement or her brief to this Court, such an argument is not before us.</p>

The dissent emphasizes the trial court's mis-characterization of Mother's testimony that she and Father tickled B.L.W. in inappropriate places on her body, contending the testimony actually was that she tickled her in appropriate places. First, such criticism is unnecessary, herein since Mother’s testimony actually was that she tickled B.L.W. on the leg, without identifying where on her leg the touching occurred. Presumably, especially in light of Mother’s limited intelligence, the trial court may have considered this testimony vague insofar as establishing unacceptable contact. Moreover, it was Mother's counsel, not Mother, who characterized the tickling in "appropriate places.” N.T., 8/29/01, at 134. Indeed, when asked if Father’s conduct was appropriate, Mother replied, "No.” <em><a href="/pa-super/388/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="388 Pa.

For example, when asked why B.L.W. and J.C.W., Jr. were removed from the home, Mother spontaneously replied, "Because we had sex in front of the kids.” <em>Id. </em>at 107. In light of the record as a whole, this misstatement by the trial court is insignificant. Such a misstatement easily can occur, and it is important not to overemphasize it. Indeed, the dissent itself mischaracterizes J.C.W., Jr.'s testimony, claiming that he recanted his original statement that he witnessed sexual activity by his parents in their home.

I find no support in the record for this conclusion. Mr. Edwards took responsibility for not entering Mother in the parenting course covering sexual boundary issues, but for another reason: he wanted her to progress further in the counseling sessions with him and he believed it premature at that point, and he was not given any time frame by CYS as to when the specific areas of therapy needed to be completed.

Attached to CYS’ brief is a copy of an order dated May 31, 2000 indicating that the plan was “ modified (proceed with adoption with concurrent planning); mother is to obtain counseling with special focus on her ability to parent, internalization of the issues relating to her child’s sexual victimization and her role in that victimization and, finally, how to insure child’s future safety.” On May 4, 2001, CYS filed a petition that acknowledges that after a hearing on April 24, 2001, [this date may be an error in CYS’ petition — I think it was probably April 24, <em>2000, </em>which resulted in the May 31, 2000 order]”the court ordered goal was concurrent planning of reunification to coincide with the recommended goal of adoption.” The May 31, 2000 order, which is not included in the certified record on appeal, is not, in my view, a clear change of goal plan from which Mother could appeal. Also, the majority’s attempt to find waiver of the claim regarding CYS’ efforts is not convincing; CYS’ efforts are inextricably tied to Mother’s ability to meet the goal of reunification and therefore are crucial to a determination of whether CYS has met its burden to justify termination under section 2511(a)(2). Section 2511(a)(2) states:</p>

(where record supported conclusion that mother was unable to care for children without continued intensive CYS involvement, termination was proper). Termination under Pennsylvania law can have a harsh result in some cases, and this is one of them. The foster parents have allowed the child to visit with Mother regularly, and Mother has seen the child on a regular basis. However, after adoption, there is no requirement that the foster parents continue to allow the mother to visit. The adoptive parents will have the right to totally cut Mother off from her daughter, whom she has been visiting faithfully whenever given the opportunity. Likewise, the adopting parents have the legal right to cut off all visits with the child’s older brother once an adoption takes place.</p>
    <p id="b421-5" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[145,1395,755,1279]]]'>¶ 8 I do agree with the majority that ultimately it may be concluded that Mother will never be able to adequately care for B.L.W. But ultimately is not now. At this point, we cannot say that mother would not be able to adequately parent child if she had the <em>appropriate </em>support from the <em>appropriate </em>agency. In this case, I believe CYS essentially abandoned Mother after the psychological report obtained by CYS indicated that Mother needed a different kind of support than that originally anticipated by CYS. While the initially suggested program would not provide the kind of support that Mother would need so that she could potentially be reunited with her daughter, CYS ignored the recommendations for a different modality of treatment. CYS should not be permitted to ignore the psychologist’s recommendations for the kind of support and treatment needed by Mother, then complain that she has not progressed enough, and then totally cut off a Mother from her child.</p>
    <p id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[944,272,757,1394]]]'>¶ 9 CYS set a goal of reunification. Mother followed through with recommended therapy the best that she could, and ultimately, Dr. Rosen, a psychologist, concluded that she needed practical, in-home counseling rather than traditional therapy in order to improve her parenting abilities. CYS was not able to provide this kind of counseling. Although such counseling is available, most likely through mental health and retardation services, CYS did nothing to assist Mother in making referrals so that she could obtain the counseling she needed. Instead, CYS resorted to termination proceedings. In light of Mother’s compromised circumstances, and without CYS support or direction, the goal was unattainable. Simply stated, the record does not support the conclusion that Mother cannot or will not remedy the parenting problems. In fact, the record shows the opposite; Mother has made great efforts to comply with CYS’ checklist, and it is CYS that has illustrated an unwillingness or inability to provide the needed services to support Mother in reaching the goal of reunification.</p>

However, we have held that this does not mean that she should be deprived of the opportunity to parent her child. <em>See In re P.A.B., </em><a href="/pa-super/391/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="391 Pa.

Mother should have the chance to pursue appropriate counseling to see if she is able to develop enough parenting skills to have B.L.W. return to live with her. If, after Mother gets the support that the experts say she needs it is determined that she still cannot cope with raising her daughter, <em>that </em>is the time for termination. Not now.</p>

Mother has a relationship with B.L.W. and faithfully visits her. Clearly CYS felt confident enough in Mother’s parenting ability in June of 2000, when CYS returned J.C.W. to Mother’s care and custody. At the termination hearing, J.C.W. testified that Mother is a good provider for him and that he is very happy at home. At that hearing J.C.W. also recanted his prior story that he witnessed Mother and Father engaging in sexual behavior with another couple. (N.T., 8/29/01, at 168-69.) Mother and J.C.W. moved to Northumber-land County to be near family and a support network. J.C.W. is now almost 19 years old. J.C.W. stated that he has a good relationship with his Mother, that she takes good care of his basic needs — cooking for him, doing his laundry, and buying him things. He also testified that when he and B.L.W. lived together in the family residence, he often looked out for her and tried to protect her from any harm. He seems to be the best evidence of Mother’s present parenting abilities in a home setting. The majority acknowledges that Mother’s home “has been deemed neat, well-kept, and without physical safety issues.” Majority Opinion, at 383. <em>(See </em>Exhibit 10, Pictures).</p>

At the termination hearing it became evident that the conditions in Mother’s home are now notably different than those present when B.L.W. was originally removed from Mother’s care. These changes are largely due to the fact that Father, who allegedly had been sexually abusing B.L.W. and conducting sexual activity with his girlfriend (not Mother) ‘in front of B.L.W., is now separated from Mother and living with his girlfriend. Fortunately, that source of CYS’ concerns no longer exits. •</p>

Since she did not get appropriate support, the trial court and majority are only guessing that Mother will not be able to do this. The conclusion flies in the face of the record, which shows Mother has made great strides already and has cooperated as much as possible with all programs CYS set forth for her. It is not Mother’s fault that the programs were not suited to her needs. That is the fault of CYS.</p>
