Popowsky and the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA) petition for review of the order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC or Commission) allowing Pennsylvania-American Water Company (PAWC or the Company), intervenor, an increase in rates which included, over OCA’s objections, approval of the Company’s claim for recovery of expenses incurred in providing benefits other than pensions to retired employees (OPEBs), i.e., health care and life insurance benefits.</p>

The Commission initiated an investigation to determine the lawfulness, justness and reasonableness of the Company’s existing and proposed rates, thereby suspending PAWC’s tariff supplement for seven months until April 22, 1993.</p>

The OPEB claim was calculated on the basis of accrual accounting, which recognizes costs at the time they are incurred, rather than cash accounting which does not recognize costs until they are actually paid. PAWC adopted accrual accounting for its OPEB costs on January 1, 1993. The Commission’s order included $4,939,856 for these OPEB costs. Under cash accounting, previously used by the Company and approved by the Commission, these OPEB costs would have been $1,242,833. In this appeal the OCA contests only the approval of the OPEB claim by the Commission’s order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b1214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1214.4",1214,[202,1072,759,990]]]'>OCA argues the Commission committed an error of law because the order (1) requires consumers to pay the cost of providing past services instead of the cost of current services, (2) includes charges that are entirely speculative, and (3) violates the rule against retroactive rate making. OCA concludes that Pennsylvania should continue to follow a minority of jurisdictions that adhere to cash accounting for OPEBs where the costs involved are certain and borne by the consumers as they are paid. The Law Bureau of the PUC, and the Company, argue this state should follow most of the states, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications Commission by adopting accrual accounting for OPEBs where the costs involved are reported when they are incurred and borne by the consumers who receive the benefit of the services that earn the OPEBs.</p>

The issuance of SFAS 106 was prompted by the FASB’s concern over mounting medical costs, an aging population and rapidly escalating, unrecorded OPEB obligations. Accrual accounting is generally the rule where it is feasible. <em>See e.g., Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v. Bell Telephone Co., </em>60 Pa. P.U.C. 435 (1985). Simply reporting that a company has one million dollars in cash tells little, particularly if it has ten million dollars in unreported obligations coming due shortly and no other income. Furthermore, the application of accounting principles is within the sound discretion of the PUC. <em>West Penn Power Co. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/pa-commw/50/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="50 Pa.

    <p id="b1214-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1214.9",1214,[1007,1222,768,940]]]'>Under SFAS 106, OPEBs are recognized as deferred compensation earned during the course of employees’ active employment and properly charged to operating expense during the period the employees provide the services necessary to earn their post-employment health and life insurance benefits. PAWC’s SFAS 106 claim has four components: (1) the service cost representing the $1,074,805 present value cost of future OPEBs earned during the test year ended March 31, 1993; (2) the transition obligation of $1,353,861, representing a 20-year amortization of the $27,077,220 present value cost of. the transition obligation; (3) interest on the total transition obligation and the service cost; and (4) $308,741 representing a five year amortization of incremental accrued OPEB costs deferred during the first four months of 1993.</p>

In addition to mandating the accrual of current period OPEB expense, SFAS 106 requires employers to record an additional expense which arises as a result of the transition from cash <a id="p1149" href="#p1149" data-label="1149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1149</a>to accrual accounting. OPEB benefits earned by employees during prior years of employment but not recorded under cash accounting must now be recognized as an accrued expense either as an expense in a single fiscal year or amortized over a period of up to twenty years.</p>
    <p id="b1215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1215.4",1215,[165,596,755,1173]]]'>OCA claims that the allowance of the costs associated with the transitional obligation violates the rule of law that current customers should pay only for current operating expenses, not past expenses, and the rule of law that prohibits retroactive rate making. The transitional obligation under accrual accounting is an expense incurred for services rendered in the past but not then recognized or recorded as an expense under cash accounting. Customers of PAWC would still be required to pay for the benefits represented by the transitional obligation if cash accounting remained in effect at the time such benefits were actually paid. Thus, there is considerable force in the Company’s argument that the approval of PAWC’s claim is not retroactive ratemaking because only the timing of the Company’s OPEB recovery, and not the amount, was changed. This is also the view taken by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), that controls wholesale utility rates. <em>Re Post-employment Benefits Other Than Pensions, </em><a href="/citations/?q=138%20P.U.R.4th%20353" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="138 P.U.R.4th 353">138 P.U.R.4th 353</a> (1993).</p>

In <em>Columbia Gas, </em>the utility sought recovery of past expenses incurred over several years to comply with an order of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DER) to investigate migration of pollutants from a site owned by Columbia. The court held that <a id="p1150" href="#p1150" data-label="1150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1150</a>ongoing expenses, incurred after the DER order was received, were not unanticipated and should have been claimed in prior rate filings. However, the court also held the utility could recover the full amount of “budget plus” plan arrearages because such ar-rearages were caused by the Commission’s order requiring Columbia to adopt billing and termination procedures and also prevented Columbia from terminating service and writing them off as uncollectible. Even though the monies Columbia sought to recover became owing in the past, the present rate proceeding was the first time that Columbia had an opportunity to seek recovery of that money in rates and, thus, allowance of the full amount did not constitute retroactive ratemaking.</p>

But it is not equitable to pass the entire obligation to future customers, which occurs under cash accounting. Nor is it equitable to charge the obligation to investors who had no opportunity to seek rate relief until now. A similar question was presented to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the case of <em>Pittsburgh v.

In that case, Bell Telephone sought allowance of a transitional obligation arising out of a failure to fully fund its pension obligations when changing from a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis to an accrual basis. In reversing the Superior Court, the Supreme Court pointed out that, in 1929, the costs of pension plans as operating expenses were not readily and widely accepted and the company hoped that the resulting increased expense could be absorbed without a rate increase. The court said:</p>

OCA’s expert witness, Ralph C.

Mingione, consulting actuary for PAWC and associated companies, disagreed with Mr. Smith stating that the actuarial assumptions employed were reasonable in light of general employer practices under SFAS 106 and fully reflected tire best economic and demographic information available. He also pointed out that, should the outlook for healthcare costs change, due to government action or some <a id="p1151" href="#p1151" data-label="1151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1151</a>other factor, subsequent valuations and thus subsequent rate filings would be expected to be adjusted to reflect the revised outlook.

Similarly, we authorize electric utilities to recover an annual accrual to be used toward the eventual decommissioning of their nuclear units.

Furthermore, the fact that SFAS 106 costs may change, as a result of a modification in either plan benefits, or the underlying actuarial assumptions, is of no consequence for ratemaking purposes, because any gains or losses resulting from such changes are reflected in the computation of the annual OPEB expense.
