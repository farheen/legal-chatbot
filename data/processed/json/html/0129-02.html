      <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>The record sets forth the following relevant facts: On January 29, 1991, Trooper Robert Snook of the Pennsylvania State Police filed an affidavit of probable cause alleging that on several occasions, between October and November of 1990, Appellant indecently assaulted his thirteen-year-old paper boy. Based on Trooper Snook’s affidavit, Magistrate Robert A. Shoff found sufficient probable cause to issue a warrant for Appellant’s arrest. Following a preliminary hearing on Februaxy 27, 1991, before Magistrate Ronald J. Horner, Appellant was held for trial on two counts of indecent assault and released on a $2,500 bond. The Commonwealth filed a criminal information on March 21, 1991, charging that “between September and November 1990”, Appellant had indecent contact with the victim who was under fourteen years of age. The information listed two separate counts of indecent assault and cited three subsections of the indecent assault statute, 18 Pa.C.S. Section 3126, as alternative bases of liability. Count I alleged that 1) the victim did not consent to such indecent contact;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and, 2) Appellant knew that the victim suffered from a mental disease or defect which rendered him incapable of appraising the nature of his conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Count II alleged that Appellant had indecent contact with the victim who was under fourteen years of age.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On May 5, 1992, a jury convicted Appellant of both counts of indecent assault. Appellant filed a post-trial motion in arrest of judgment, as well as a supplemental motion for a new trial, arguing that he found new evidence that Magistrate Robert A. Shoff had a personal family relationship with the victim, thus warranting a new trial. An evidentiary hearing was held on March 23, 1993 to determine if Appellant was entitled to a new trial based on the claim that Magistrate Shoffs son, Scott Shoff, lived with the victim’s mother, Joanne May Ert-wine. On July 1, 1993, the trial court denied Appellant’s post-trial motion and motion for a new trial.</p>

Appellant claims that the victim’s testimony is unreliable due to the fact that he suffers from a brain stem injury and exhibits apparent learning difficulties. Appellant contends that the victim was “quite confused” when subject to direct examination. Appellant’s Brief, at p. 16. Appellant implies that the victim may have confused him with another criminal defendant, Mr. Thomas Schnars. The record reveals that on December 17, 1990, Mr. Schnars entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to jail for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse involving the same young boy who is the alleged victim in this case. Furthermore, Appellant argues that the direct testimony of the victim’s mother, Joanne May Ertwine, and Trooper Robert Snook reveals that the victim had difficulty clearly describing the alleged acts of indecent contact which led to Appellant’s arrest and subsequent conviction. Appellant argues that even if the victim was found competent to testify by the trial judge, the factfinder is not free to believe all of his allegations and accusations. He submits that “competence to testify does not end all inquiry ...” Appellant’s Brief, at p. 20.</p>

In that case the appellant argued that it was reversible error for the trial judge to permit his preliminary hearing to be held in the Holmesburg State Correctional Institution and not in a courtroom open to the public. The appellant argued that the closed preliminary hearing violated his due process rights and his right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article One, Sections 9 and 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This Court agreed that the trial court improperly closed the preliminary hearing. However, we did not agree that this necessitated a new trial since, “the remedy must be closely fashioned to suit the harm.” <em>Murray, </em><a href="/pa-super/348/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="348 Pa.

We agree. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge explained that in order to find Appellant guilty of Count I, indecent assault without consent, they must find that four elements were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. One of these elements was lack of consent by the victim. Once the jury heard that lack of consent was an element of Count I, it is possible that they would mistakenly assume that consent is also an element of Count II, indecent assault where the victim is under fourteen. The trial judge’s instruction was necessary to avoid this mistaken assumption.

In <em>Rhoads, </em>the appellant was charged and convicted of two subsections of the simple assault statute, 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2701(a)(1) and (a)(2). After the original sentence was vacated, the trial court resen-teneed the appellant to two consecutive periods of incarceration of one to two years for the two different subsections of the simple assault statute. On appeal, this Court vacated the two sentences and held, “[t]he imposition of separate sentences for the two counts of simple assault arising from a single act was an illegal sentence.” <em><a href="/a2d/636/1166-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="636 A.2d 1166" data-case-ids="7374585,937924" data-case-paths="/a2d/636/1166-01,/pa-super/431/0437-01">Id.</a> </em><a href="/a2d/636/1166-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="636 A.2d 1166" data-case-ids="7374585,937924" data-case-paths="/a2d/636/1166-01,/pa-super/431/0437-01">636 A.2d at 1169</a>. Again, the use of the disjunctive “or” within the framework of the simple assault statute suggested that the “legislature intended each separate subsection to establish an alternative basis for culpability rather than each representing the commission of a separate crime for sentencing purposes.” <em><a href="/a2d/636/1166-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="636 A.2d 1166" data-case-ids="7374585,937924" data-case-paths="/a2d/636/1166-01,/pa-super/431/0437-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/636/1166-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="636 A.2d 1166" data-case-ids="7374585,937924" data-case-paths="/a2d/636/1166-01,/pa-super/431/0437-01">at 1168</a>. <em>(See also Commonwealth v.

Both of those cases involve a single criminal episode. In the instant case, the victim testified that Appellant touched him on approximately ten different occasions. Despite this testimony, the Commonwealth did not specify separate acts of indecent assault in its information. Instead, the information generally charged Appellant with indecent assault between September and November of 1990. The Commonwealth listed three of the sub<a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>sections of the indecent assault statute as alternative bases of liability, not as separate instances of criminal activity. If each criminal offense is separately charged, each may be separately punished. <em>Commonwealth v.

Because the Commonwealth failed to specify separate instances of indecent assault in the information, we find that the rationale of <em>Shannon </em>and <em>Rhoads </em>applies. Therefore, Appellant may only be sentenced for one episode of indecent assault.</p>
