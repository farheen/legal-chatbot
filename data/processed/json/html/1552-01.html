When so viewed, we find the quite impressive technical data set forth in Wanmaker resulted from excitation of the phosphor by radiation which has “a wave length of 253.7 mu” and at wave<a id="p1558" href="#p1558" data-label="1558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1558</a>lengths “produced by the mercury discharge of a low-pressure mercury vapour discharge tube.” The specification also points out:</p>

While Oberst was employed as a laboratory technician and not as a scientist, he had been so employed for a number of years and a reference to his notes and work books as contained in the physical exhibits corroborate the nature of the work concerning which he testified.

On this aspect of the case we agree with the board’s statement that:</p>
    <blockquote id="AcmY" data-blocks='[["BL_881.8",881,[125,2022,1326,448]]]'>In this case the count is drawn to a phosphor having the specified composition which is prepared by mixing raw materials in the proper proportions to give the desired ratios of the metals and phosphorus and firing at an elevated temperature. The product formed is believed to be more in the nature of a mixture rather than a definite chemical compound. We believe that it would be obvious that products as defined in the count were formed by Oberst on behalf of Rimbach. We also believe that it would be obvious that the copper would be in the cuprous state due to the fact that it is present in only a small amount and the composition [sic] were fired under reducing conditions. In view of all the circumstances we believe that ithe record establishes that the compositions prepared on behalf of Rimbach were within the scope of the count.</blockquote>

Suitable atmospheres are, for example, nitrogen or a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen. The temperature at which the production takes place is chosen between 1000° C. and 1250° C. The heating time depends on the reactivity of the compounds used and so <em>inter alia </em>on the grain size of the initial substances. 'It is preferably chosen between 1 and 2 hours.</blockquote>

Also, Oberst testified as to the reducing atmosphere in which the tests were conducted. Wanmaker also challenges Rimbach’s position on the basis that “there is no testimony presented as to the color of the radiation produced.” This, like their attack on Rimbach’s case because of failure to prove use of the phosphor compounds in a HPMV lamp, must fail for the reason that the count is silent both as to any color requirement of the composition and as to its end use in a HPMV lamp.</p>
