Upon review of the record and the parties’ memoranda, and after hearing the oral arguments of counsel, we conclude that cause has not been shown, and we summarily affirm the judgment of the Family Court.</p>

The case plan goal at that time was reunification. Over the course of the next three years, two DCYF caseworkers developed at least eight case plans for Michael’s parents, addressing numerous issues, including inadequate parenting, domestic violence, mental health problems, and alcohol use and abuse. In August 1999, more than three years after Michael was committed to DCYF custody, DCYF filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of mother and father pursuant to G.L.1956 § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii) and § 15-7-7(a)(3). After a hearing, parents’ parental rights were terminated pursuant to a decree entered on May 24, 2000. This appeal followed. The sole issue raised on appeal was whether (DCYF) made “reasonable efforts” to reunify Michael with his parents, as required by § 15-7-7(b)(l). Specifically, mother contended that DCYF failed to provide critical services to assist her in strengthening her relationship with Michael and failed to keep her informed of Michael’s health, progress, and development. The father asserted that the department’s efforts focused too heavily on mother and that he “received no meaningful assistance from the state.” We conclude that parents’ arguments are without merit.</p>

    <p id="b520-10" data-blocks='[["BL_520.10",520,[1006,1489,751,924]]]'>In this case, the record revealed that DCYF caseworkers developed numerous case plans between July 1996 and July 1999, in an effort to achieve reunification between Michael and his parents. For a portion of that time period, Michael was permitted to return to his parents’ care, conditioned on compliance with the DCYF case plans. Continued domestic violence on the part of father, and mother’s repeated refusal to prevent contact between Michael and father, however, resulted in Michael’s removal from his parents’ care. Moreover, mother was inconsistent in keeping counseling appointments and in bringing Michael to supervised day care appointments, and father reportedly refused to sign any of the many case plans.</p>

Michael’s pediatrician, Robert Burke, M.D. (Dr. Burke), testified that he noticed a “stunning, dramatic difference” in Michael’s behavior from the time of this change in placement. Previously, mother had complained of Michael’s behavior and had reported that Michael would hit, slap and bite her. While in his mother’s care, Michael had also been observed drinking from the toilet, eating and smearing his own feces, and biting his fingers through the skin. Dr. Burke testified that much of this behavior was the product of the “socially toxic environment” of Michael’s parents’ home.</p>

This Court does not believe so, in fight of the evidence produced during the many hours of testimony.” We are constrained to concur with the trial justice’s assessment that no amount of effort on the part of DCYF was likely to enable these parents “to change [their] conduct and to improve the conditions that caused [Michael] to enter DCYF care initially.” <em>In re John W., </em><a href="/a2d/682/0930-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="682 A.2d 930" data-case-ids="7866443" data-case-paths="/a2d/682/0930-01">682 A.2d 930</a>, 932 (R.I.1996) (per curiam).
