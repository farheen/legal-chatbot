The suit involves attempts to rezone certain lands owned by Shellburne in New Castle County, presently zoned commercial, located near the residential developments known as. Shellburne, Welshire, and Liftwood.</p>
    <p id="b365-17" data-blocks='[["BL_365.18",365,[1026,441,751,663]]]'>The following determinative facts are undisputed: On December 22, 1965, a building permit was issued to Shellburne for the construction of a commercial building on the land here involved. The parcel had been zoned commercial since 1954. Earlier attempts by Shellburne to begin construction had been delayed, particularly during 1964 and 1965, by unsuccessful attempts of the owners of nearby properties to initiate the rezoning of the subject tract. The last such attempt culminated in an Order of the Chancery Court in Shellburne’s favor on December 22, 1965.</p>
    <p id="b365-19" data-blocks='[["BL_365.19",365,[1021,1141,755,995]]]'>On January 11, 1966, the three Commissioners of the Levy Court adopted a Resolution requesting the Zoning Commission “to hold a Public Hearing and to make its recommendation to the Levy Court upon the matter of the rezoning” of the subject parcel of land “from C-l to R-l-C classification.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On the same date, the Building Inspector received a letter from the defendant Joseph F. Dayton, one of the Levy Court Commissioners, directing the Building Inspector to stop all work on the subject tract under the outstanding building permit. Such order was issued to Shell-burne by the Building Inspector forthwith. Neither of the other Levy Court Commissioners, the defendants John D. Daniello and Harry B. Roberts, Jr., had prior knowledge of the instructions issued by Dayton to the Building Inspector. This action followed.</p>

By this suit, Shell-burne sought (1) to restrain the Levy Court <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>and the Zoning Commission from “entertaining any petition for rezoning” the subject land “from its present classification of C-l to R-l-C and/or from conducting any proceedings concerning such rezoning”; (2) to restrain the Building Inspector “from stopping any work under the valid and legal existing building permit or from refusing to issue any additional permits where proper regulations and requirements are fulfilled”; (3)' to restrain the Levy Court and all defendants “from interfering in any way with the orderly, proper, and normal issuance of building permits or the work under the present permits”; and (4) to recover damages from “individuals where their office has been wrongfully used.”</p>

Thereafter, by Order dated December 28, 1966, the Chancery Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants Dayton and Daniello absolving them from personal liability for damages arising from the Resolution of January 11, 1966 or from the stoppage' of work by the Building Inspector. Shellburne appeals from that Order.</p>
    <p id="b366-9" data-blocks='[["BL_366.9",366,[974,446,753,1274]]]'>Subsequently, on January 3, 1967, as the result of the New Castle County Reorganization Act, 9 Del.C. Chap. 11, the newly-elected County Council of New Castle County replaced the dissolved Levy Court. At the first business meeting of the Council held January 9, 1967, Ordinance No. 67-2 was introduced providing for the rezoning of the subject property from C-l to R-l-C classification. At the same meeting, Ordinance No. 67-3 was introduced providing that no building permit shall issue as to any land with respect to which a rezoning ordinance has been introduced, until adoption or rejection of the ordinance, or the expiration of 90 days from the date of introduction of the ordinance, whichever first occurs. Ordinance No. 67-3 was approved at the Council meeting of January 25, 1967. At the Council meeting of January 30, 1967, Ordinance No. 67-2 was withdrawn, for some reason unexplained in this record, and an identical ordinance, being No. 67-5, was introduced which would rezone the subject parcel. The latter ordinance remains pending.</p>

The ground upon which the dismissal of the appeal is sought is that the appeal from the Order of December 28, 1966 was not taken until April 28, 1967, when the appeal was taken from the other Orders, all dated March 1, 1967; that, therefore, the appeal from the Order of December 28, 1966 is barred by the 60 day limitation of 10 Del.C. § 145 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and Supreme Court Rule 23, Del.C.Ann.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b367-17" data-blocks='[["BL_367.18",367,[1010,282,752,666]]]'>We dispose of the motion on the basis of Chancery Rule 54(b) :<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Order of December 28, 1966 lacked “an express determination that there is no just reason for delay” and “an express direction for the entry of judgment” upon the claim for money damages against Dayton and Daniello individually. Under Rule 54(b), a final judgment is not deemed entered in a multiple claim case in the absence of such express determination and direction.

    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[183,601,754,1483]]]'>The motion to amend the complaint and to add parties was based upon the premise that the County Council was the “successor” of the Levy Court; that the actions of the Council in January 1967 were “part of the same scheme and plan” as that in which the Levy Court Resolution of January 11, 1966 figured. The premise is faulty. The Levy Court of New Castle County and the office of Levy Court Commissioner were abolished by the New Castle County Reorganization Act, 9 Del.C. § 1141(b); and the two incumbent Levy Court Commissioners thereby became members at large of the County Council, temporarily consisting of nine members. Thus, the Councilmen did not become “successors” to the Levy Court Commissioners as newly elected Levy Court Commissioners might have been. In the exercise of its discretion, the Chancery Court would have been warranted in concluding that the Council and its actions were not sufficiently related to the Levy Court and its actions to justify blanketing them all within the same cause of action. Any grievance that Shellburne may have against the County Council may be the subject of a separate cause of action — witness the fact that Shellburne had filed such separate action against the County Council before the hearing on this appeal.</p>

That motion was based upon the alleged violation of the Order of February 23, 1966, enjoining <em>inter alia </em>the “successors” of the Levy Court from “holding zoning hearings or in any way acting upon the resolution of the Levy Court dated January 11, 1966” and from “interfering in any way with the work under the existing Building Permit * * * or from revoking or attempting to revoke the present permit; * *</p>
    <p id="b368-9" data-blocks='[["BL_368.10",368,[985,695,751,852]]]'>Obviously, the County Council was not “successor” to the Levy Court in the sense in which that word was used in the Order of February 23, 1966. The Levy Court Resolution of January 11, 1966 expired with the Levy Court. Moreover, there was no showing that the Council had held any zoning hearings, the Council’s action being limited to the introduction, without passage, of Ordinance No. 67-5. And the Council had not interfered with any work under the building permit of December 1964, the only action by the Council regarding building permits being the passage of Ordinance No. 67-3, approved January 25, 1967, which had prospective application only to building permits applied for after January 25, 1967.</p>

Accordingly, in casting his vote upon the Resolution at an official meeting of the Levy Court, Dayton was acting in his legislative capacity. Members of legislative bodies are not answerable in damages on account of their votes, cast in the exercise of discretion vested in them by virtue of their office. There is an absolute legislative immunity against personal liability in this regard, the motive underlying the legislative vote, good or bad, being wholly irrelevant. E. g., Village of Hicksville v. Blakeslee, <a href="/ohio-st/103/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="103 Ohio St. 508" data-case-ids="964030" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/103/0508-01">103 Ohio St. 508</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20N.E.%20445" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="134 N.E. 445">134 N.E. 445</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.L.R.%20119" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="22 A.L.R. 119">22 A.L.R. 119</a> (1921); Pawlowski v.

If it was, he is immune from personal liability, but the immunity is conditioned upon the absence of bad faith or malice or improper motive. A public executive officer is adequately protected, in our opinion, by such conditional immunity. A proper balance is struck thereby between adequate protection for the properly motivated public official against harassment by a vindictive citizen, and adequate protection for the private citizen against the malice or bad faith of an improperly motivated public official. We realize that the federal rule grants a complete immunity to executive officers acting within the scope of their authority, Barr v.

We adopt as the better rule the conditional immunity for executive officers acting within the general scope of their authority, prevailing in the great majority of the states, under which malice or bad faith or corrupt motive will transform an otherwise immune act into one from which liability may ensue.

On the other hand, countering this, it may be found from Dayton’s testimony that his only motive was to save Shellburne from unnecessary financial risk in going forward with the construction in view of the forthcoming Levy Court Resolution requesting the Zoning Commission to review the zoning classification of the tract.

      <blockquote id="b367-23" data-blocks='[["BL_367.23",367,[1056,1864,661,706]]]'>“(b) Judgment upon Multiple Claims. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.”</blockquote>
