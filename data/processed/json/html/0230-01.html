In November, 1975, Lionel Thiboutot was notified by the Maine Department of Human Services of a reduction in AFDC benefits which the Department deemed required by a change of federal regulations. The change was essentially as follows: In computing the available income of Lionel in order to determine the amount of AFDC benefits allowed for Lionel’s three children of whom Joline was not the mother, the Department would no longer subtract that portion of Lionel’s income which went to the support of the four children of both Lionel and Joline (those children not being eligible for AFDC benefits), although Lionel was required by law to support those children and in fact did support them.</p>

However, a theme running pervasively through the federal decisions is that unless a state has consented to being sued for retrospective welfare benefits mistakenly withheld, it should be immune to section 1983 actions for their recovery. The liability for such benefits is peculiar: First, unlike liability in tort, liability for such benefits to a class does not typically arise from wilful or even negligent wrongdoing; underpayment of welfare benefits to a class is more likely to result from good-faith misinterpretation of the complex federal regulations under which welfare programs must be administered. Second, the financial burden on the state treasury to meet retrospective payments of welfare benefits may becomé great if a large class of welfare recipients has been affected for a long time. The many pressing needs for welfare assistance and the practical difficulty some states encounter in raising matching funds to meet them adequately suggest caution about compelling state welfare officials to assign priority, in effect, to correcting past underpayments, which can amount to large sums, ahead of current and perhaps more critical needs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The limitations, referred to earlier in this opinion, contained in the social security regulations themselves suggest strongly that correction of past underpayments is not regarded t&gt;y welfare officials as a matter of highest priority in the administration of the AFDC program.</p>

Congress has passed many statutes <em>requiring </em>that fees be awarded to a prevailing party. Again the Committee adopted a more moderate approach here by leaving the matter to the discretion of the judge, guided of course by the case law interpreting similar attorney’s fee provisions. This approach was supported by the Justice Department on Dec. 31, 1975. The Committee intends that, at a minimum, existing judicial standards, to which ample reference is made in this report, should guide the courts in construing H.R. 15460.” H.R.Rep.No.94 — 1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.
