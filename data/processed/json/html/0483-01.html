The Board on Professional Responsibility (“the Board”) has recommended that this court impose identical reciprocal discipline as to practice in the District of Columbia. Respondent contends that the presumption in favor of identical reciprocal discipline is overcome in this case, because the proceedings in Florida did not meet the requirements of due process and because there was an infirmity of proof to establish the charged misconduct. We conclude that respondent has failed to support his contentions with clear and convincing evidence, and we therefore adopt the Board’s recommendation.</p>

Respondent left Florida in May of 2000 and moved to the District of Columbia. Thereafter, he failed to pay any child support for 25 months, falling $100,000 behind in his payments. On August 5, 2002, the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida (the “Florida Family Court”) issued an order requiring respondent to pay $30,000 of the past-due child support by October 1, 2002, $30,000 by November 1, 2002, and $40,000 by December 1, 2002, while also satisfying his ongoing child-support obligation of $4,000 per month. At a hearing on November 22, 2002, finding that as of that date respondent had failed to make any of the required payments, the court held respondent in civil contempt and ordered him incarcerated until he purged himself of contempt.

Respondent claims a deprivation of due process on the basis of various purported deficiencies in the Florida proceedings, only some of which ostensibly relate to “notice” and “opportunity to be heard.” We address respondent’s arguments, however, generously construing them as arguments that he was entitled to, but deprived of, notice of properly brought charges and an opportunity to have his case heard without undue delay by qualified and impartial judicial officers. <em>See Boddie v.
