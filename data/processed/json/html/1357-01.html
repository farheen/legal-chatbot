    <p id="b1424-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1424.10",1424,[181,936,757,747]]]'>This is an appeal from a decision of the Superior Court which reversed a driver’s license revocation by the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles (the “Division”). The appellant, Michael D. Shahan, the Director of the Division (the “Director”), contends that the Superior Court erred in its holding that a ruling of a Justice of the Peace rendered while the Superior Court appeal was pending constituted <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estop-pel on the issue of probable cause to charge a violation of 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4177(a). We conclude that the Superior Court correctly applied the principles underlying the bar of collateral estoppel and accordingly, we affirm.</p>

On December 8,1992, the appellee, Raymond E. Landing (“Landing”), was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4177(a). Incident to the arrest, Landing refused to submit to an intoxilyzer test, thus triggering the provisions of 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2742, which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>for an administrative hearing which could result in the revocation of the arrestee’s driver’s license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A hearing officer, employed by the Division, conducted a revocation hearing on March 17, 1993, at which the arresting officer testified concerning the circumstances of Landing’s arrest. The following day, the hearing officer issued a written decision in which he concluded that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that Landing violated 21 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 4177 and that Landing had refused to submit to a chemical test for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol after being informed of the penalty of revocation for such refusal.</p>
    <p id="b1424-16" data-blocks='[["BL_1424.22",1424,[986,1271,751,564]]]'>Later on the same day as the administrative ruling issued, Landing appeared in a Justice of the Peace Court for trial on the criminal charge of driving under the influence. At trial, Landing’s attorney moved to suppress the evidence against him on the ground that there was no probable cause for his arrest. The Justice of the Peace granted the motion to suppress, finding no probable cause, and Landing was subsequently acquitted of the charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. The State did not appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b1424-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1424.23",1424,[985,1868,750,132]],["BL_1425.1",1425,[162,249,752,416]]]'>After the ruling and acquittal by the Justice of the Peace, Landing filed an appeal in the Superior Court from the revocation deci<a id="p1359" href="#p1359" data-label="1359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1359</a>sion of the hearing officer as provided by 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2744. Landing contended that under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel the Superior Court was bound by the Justice of the Peace Court’s determination of lack of probable cause. Accordingly, it was argued, the hearing officer’s revocation decision which was pending review in the Superior Court must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b1425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1425.4",1425,[162,686,754,704]]]'>The Superior Court ruled that, although the appeal from the Division was limited to the administrative record, the scope of review included a <em>de novo </em>determination of the legal issue of probable cause. The court concluded that the “prior final decision” of the Justice of the Peace Court precluded further litigation of that issue. The Director appeals that ruling, contending that the issue of probable cause is not subject to relit-igation in the Superior Court in an appeal under 21 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2744 and that the Superior Court erred in applying <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel to the factual determination of the hearing officer.</p>
    <p id="b1425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1425.5",1425,[161,1412,754,945]]]'>The arrest of a defendant for a violation of 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4177 may precipitate two separate proceedings, one criminal and the other administrative or civil. The criminal proceeding determines guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with fine and/or imprisonment as a consequence if the defendant is found guilty. The civil or administrative proceeding is designed to result in the revocation of the defendant’s driver’s license if probable cause existed to charge the defendant with a violation of 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 4177 or if the defendant refuses to undergo a blood alcohol test upon arrest. In either event, the determination of probable cause to arrest is an essential finding at the administrative level in order to effect a license revocation. The required level of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Cook v. Oberly, </em>Del.Ch., <a href="/a2d/459/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="459 A.2d 535" data-case-ids="7972844" data-case-paths="/a2d/459/0535-01">459 A.2d 535</a>, 540 (1983).</p>

But because of the differing levels of proof between the criminal trial and the administrative proceedings, an acquittal on the merits of the driving under the influence charge is not <em>res judicata </em>with respect to a later conducted administrative hearing. <em>Clendaniel v. Voshell, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/562/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="562 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="7357688" data-case-paths="/a2d/562/1167-01">562 A.2d 1167</a>, 1170 (1989). Where, however, the issue of probable cause has been separately determined in the earlier criminal proceeding, it may preclude a “later administrative proceeding ... if a trial judge had specifically found that the State had failed to prove that the police officer had probable cause for his action.” <em><a href="/a2d/562/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="562 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="7357688" data-case-paths="/a2d/562/1167-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/562/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="562 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="7357688" data-case-paths="/a2d/562/1167-01">at 1171</a>. Such issue preclusion is a direct result of the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in view of the identities of the parties and the commonality of the underlying factual contentions in both the criminal and administrative proceedings. Collateral estoppel “is based on the consideration that the proper administration of justice will be served best by limiting parties to one trial of one issue.” <em>Lewis v. Hanson, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.2d%20819" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="128 A.2d 819">128 A.2d 819</a>, 834 (1957). When asserted, the doctrine precludes the relitigation of issues in successive tribunals exercising appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b1425-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1425.8",1425,[961,1486,759,604]]]'>The Director argues that since the determination of lack of probable cause in the criminal proceeding before the Justice of the Peace followed the earlier ruling at the administrative level, it does not bar the administrative determination even though the Division’s ruling was pending appeal. The Director’s assertion assumes that the issue of probable cause was not open to review in the Superior Court under the appeal authorized by 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2744. The Superior Court rejected that narrow view of its power of review as do we.</p>

Such appeals are limited to an examination of the record made before the administrative body. Super.Ct.Civ.lt. 72(g). The Superior Court is required to examine the record to determine if substantial evidence exists to support the hearing officer’s factual findings and to correct any errors of law. <em>Eskridge v. Voshell, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=593%20A.2d%20589" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="593 A.2d 589">593 A.2d 589</a> (1991) (ORDER). Although factual findings are limited to rec<a id="p1360" href="#p1360" data-label="1360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1360</a>ord review, the determination of probable cause remains a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/624/0926-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="624 A.2d 926" data-case-ids="7363784" data-case-paths="/a2d/624/0926-01">624 A.2d 926</a>, 928 (1993). The reviewing court is required to engage in a weighing process to determine whether the evidence presented to the hearing officer established by a preponderance that probable cause existed. <em>Voshell v. Attix, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=574%20A.2d%20264" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="574 A.2d 264">574 A.2d 264</a> (1990) (ORDER). Where that same weighing process has occurred before a court of competent jurisdiction with the same antagonists, a final ruling on that issue precludes a later judicial resolution of the matter. As to that issue, the parties have had their day in court. <em>Lewis v. Hanson, swpra.</em>
