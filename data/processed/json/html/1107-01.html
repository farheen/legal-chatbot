However, this statutory and ordinance pattern for the board’s review jurisdiction understandably makes no provision for having the board review conditional use administrative adjudications by city council. For example, if city council rejected a conditional use application — involving a development which the Code, as above noted, describes as having a very substantial planning significance and impact — it would be very anomalous if an applicant were then able to turn to the appointed board and ask that board to overturn the rejection issued by the elected city council.</p>

Again not just Shadyside but all medical helistops are exempt from these specifications. Again Ordinance 40 does not anticipate that medical helistops be completely unregulated, but requires that they comply with specific conditions set by City Council. In Shadyside’s case Council approved the helistop at a location 370 feet from the nearest residential structure, and specified that flights between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. be limited to an average of five a month. The requirements in special exception cases are a setback of at least 400 feet in the event of three or more night flights per month and of 300 feet in the event of less than three night flights per month. A comparison of these standards and the conditions actually imposed on Shadyside reveals a difference of 30 feet in the setback requirements, a difference which though not negligible can be justified by the legitimate goal of permitting more flexibility for medical helis-tops than for purely commercial facilities.</p>
