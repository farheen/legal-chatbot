(Laurie), in the School District. Beginning with his entrance to school in kindergarten, Laurie was concerned with Brandon’s behavior and he began receiving counseling and therapy services. Although his test scores were, in many cases, above average throughout grades one through five, due to his behavioral problems, he was first referred for evaluation for special education services<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> as a fifth grader in October 1998, but the results indicated that he was ineligible. However, a service agreement was developed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for Brandon in January 1999 to address his symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was revised in September 1999 to include additional accommodations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In November 1999, Brandon entered a partial hospitalization program for his emotional and behavioral problems. The program goals included anger management, self-esteem, peer relations, noncompliance and problems with social skills. He was diagnosed with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and it was noted that depression was to be ruled out. His psychiatrist recommended that Brandon <a id="p1252" href="#p1252" data-label="1252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1252</a>receive emotional support services upon his release, and his mother arranged for such services.</p>

He was again evaluated in January 2000 as a sixth-grader and was identified as a child with an emotional disturbance and other health impairments in need of special education. An individual education program (IEP)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> team determined that Brandon was eligible for special education, and that his behaviors impeded his learning and/or the learning of others because Brandon had difficulty sustaining attention, completing assignments, accepting adult directives and gaining attention from peers in appropriate-ways. He also typically displayed disruptive behavior and sometimes demonstrated drastic mood changes and often blamed others for his own behavior. Conséquently, an IEP was developed for him on February 22, 2000, along with a behavior intervention plan. In March 2000, Brandon was suspended from school for ten days for making terroristic threats. A new IEP was developed in May 2000 which included a behavioral support plan and continued his placement in emotional and learning support. Another IEP was developed in March 2001 which contained similar goals to the previous IEP.</p>
    <p id="b1290-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1290.6",1290,[996,401,754,1268]]]'>During the spring of 2001, Brandon was suspended from school on numerous occasions for exclusions from school. Although Brandon’s mother requested a new evaluation, none was completed. During the 2001-2002 school year, when Brandon was in eighth grade, his grades declined. After he was involved in an incident involving drugs, a manifestation determination hearing was held and it was decided that he would attend Longmore Academy, an alternative school. The evaluation that his mother had previously requested was then conducted by the. School District in January 2002. Brandon was administered numerous tests,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and an evaluation report was completed in April 2002, which included reports of his teachers from Longmore Academy. The evaluation report indicated that Brandon’s cognitive-intellectual ability was average and- that his behavioral difficulties were “more associated with socially maladjusted and conduct related behaviors rather than behaviors associated with a serious emotional disturbance.”</p>

Rather, his behavior met the description of a socially maladjusted youngster. The IEP team decided that Brandon would attend school at Holy Family Institute in lieu of expulsion, and he was no longer eligible for special education services. Brandon’s mother requested a due process hearing. At issue was whether Brandon was an emotionally disturbed child and, if so, whether he was in need of special education.</p>

He stated that he collected a lot of different types of information through interviews, observations, individualized assessments, teacher assessments from the various schools Brandon had attended, behavioral specialist assessments, and his own personal interviews with Brandon. He also stated that comprehensive testing was performed on Brandon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Mr. Semow opined that based upon all the information that comprised <a id="p1254" href="#p1254" data-label="1254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1254</a>the evaluation, Brandon did not meet the eligibility requirements necessary for a student with a specific academic learning disability, other health impairment or serious emotional disturbance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

He stated that he administered the Beck Depression Inventory test to determine if Brandon was depressed and, if so, to what degree; and he gave Brandon the Sentence Completion test where he started a sentence which Brandon finished. Dr. Utay said there was no score associated with this test, but it only provided valuable information. Coupled with an informal session where he talked with Brandon, he arrived at his opinion. He noted first that at the time Brandon came to him, Brandon was being seen by a psychiatrist and was on medication for ADHD and depression. He then opined that based on his testing and information provided by Laurie, Brandon did suffer from depression, from ADHD and ODD, and met the definition of a child with an emotional disturbance and other health impairment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The first test was an Individual Assessment of Visual-Motor Integration which is the Developmental Test of Visual-Perception, Developmental Test of Motor-Coordination, Developmental Test of Motor Integration which is used as a screen to assess if there is any medical problem that may require an alternative form of assessment. Brandon’s scores were average. The next test was the Wech-sler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition to get an idea of his ability to make comparisons for future testing when they checked for academic achievement to do a diagnosis of a learning disability and to see how he performed with verbal comprehension, verbal reasoning ability and overall nonverbal problem solving-type skills directed through activities that required looking at a novel task and solving a problem. Brandon had overall general intellectual functioning in the average range for someone his age. Previously, Brandon had taken the Stanford-Bi-net IV test in November 1998 with the same results. Thereafter, Mr. Semow administered the listening comprehension subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Second Edition in which Brandon scored in the high average range for his age. Brandon took the Individual Academic Achievement— Ability/Achievement Discrepancy Analysis to determine learning disabilities and the results ruled out any specific learning disability in the academic areas assessed. Mr. Semow also assessed Brandon through the Achen-back Child Behavior Checklist which revealed that Brandon tested to have significant delinquent behavior; the Behavior Assessment System Self-Report of Personality and the Behavioral Assessment System, the teacher report form indicated that Brandon’s behaviors associated with school maladjustment were elevated when compared to his behaviors associated with clinical maladjustment, meaning that his behaviors were more associated with conduct-related behaviors than with regard to behaviors associated with an emotional disturbance. Mr. Semow stated these results were corroborated by teacher observations of Brandon’s behaviors in the classroom setting. Finally, Brandon’s teachers were administered the Differential Test of Conduct and Emotional Problems to differentiate between conduct problem behaviors and emotional problem areas seen in children and adolescents and their results indicated that Brandon’s behaviors were more associated with conduct-related behaviors than with behaviors associated with an emotional disturbance. Again, Mr. Semow testified that these were corroborated with teacher observations of Brandon’s behaviors in the classroom setting.</p>
