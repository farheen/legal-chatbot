Pursuant to Section 19-6 of the Working Agreement between the City of Pittsburgh and the Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge No. 1 (Working Agreement), Appellant appealed his discharge and elected to proceed before a tripartite arbitration board comprised of a City designee, an FOP designee and a neutral member who served as board chairman. Arbitration commenced on February 2, 1999 and, with the parties’ consent, the arbitration panel continued its deliberations on February 18, 1999. The parties agreed that Chairman Michael E. Zobrak would write the arbitration award.</p>

Chairman Zobrak concluded by stating that he “will expand on these positions in my full award.” <em>Id.</em>

The first paragraph of this document states that the parties were notified of the panel’s decision by letter of February 22, 1999 and that the document explains in detail the reasoning applied by the panel to reach its determination. R.R. 9a.</p>
    <p id="b742-5" data-blocks='[["BL_742.5",742,[197,1148,758,790]]]'>On April 12, 1999, Appellant filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award. On May 9, 1999, the City filed a motion to quash the petition on the grounds that it was filed beyond the thirty-day appeal period provided by Section 5571(b) of the Judicial Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The City averred that the final award was issued February 22, 1999, in accordance with Section 19-8 of the Working Agreement. In relevant part, Section 19-8 states that “the Arbitration Board’s decision must be issued in writing within five working days of the hearing, and a supporting opinion, if one-is requested, may be issued within thirty days of the hearing.” R.R. 80a.</p>

Appellant also maintains that allowing the appeal period to begin with- the issuance of the “full decision” would not prejudice the City.</p>
    <p id="b742-13" data-blocks='[["BL_742.12",742,[998,940,755,1397]]]'>Appellate review of a trial court’s order granting a motion to quash an appeal as untimely is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion or committed an error of law. <em>Fraternal Order of Police, White Rose Lodge No. 15 v. City of York, </em><a href="/a2d/708/0855-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="708 A.2d 855" data-case-ids="11821476" data-case-paths="/a2d/708/0855-01">708 A.2d 855</a> (Pa. Cmwlth.1998). In the present case, the language of the parties’ Working Agreement unambiguously requires the arbitrators’ decision to be issued in writing within five working days. The February 22, 1999 letter definitively informed Appellant that the grievance was denied and set forth the basis for the panel’s determination, i.e., Appellant’s misconduct. In addition, Section 19-12 of the Working Agreement permits the five-day time limitation set .forth in Section 19-8 to be extended by written consent of the parties; as the City observes, this section provides grievants the opportunity to delay a decision without filing a protective appeal. Thus, we reject Appellant’s contention that the bargained for provisions of the Working Agreement leave grievants no alternative other than to flood the courts with unnecessary appeals.</p>
