Watt contends that summary judgment was inappropriate because triable issues of fact exist as to (1) whether UniFirst implemented immediate and appropriate corrective action in response to Watt’s complaints of sexual harassment, and (2) whether UniFirst’s alleged non-discriminatory reason for her termination was pre-textual. We vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>

At the beginning of her employment, Watt received training on the company’s policies concerning sexual and other forms of harassment, and was told to promptly report any incidents of harassment to a supervisor or manager. UniFirst’s written policy states that “every report of harassment will be investigated thoroughly and promptly,” and that if an employee is dissatisfied with the response to such a report, the employee should contact the Corporate Employee Relations Manager.</p>

Get the f**k out of here, now!” Hughes then approached Watt with “balled fists.” Oliver responded by telling Watt to go back inside the plant.</p>

Begin met with Watt and Hughes the next day. They discussed Watt’s allegations and, at the end of the meeting, Begin, in effect, told Hughes to mind his own business.</p>

Smith later spoke to Hughes, who acknowledged that he had attempted to hug and kiss Watt and had asked her out on a date.

He was told that if the problem was not corrected he would be terminated. Thompson also sent a letter to Watt’s attorney <a id="p901" href="#p901" data-label="901" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*901</a>informing him of the action taken, that he would be changing Hughes’s duties so that Hughes would not be working in the same area as Watt, and that Watt should contact him immediately if any further problems arose with Hughes.</p>

He called her a “black bitch” and warned that he would “put [her] where [her] mother is,” and Watt maintains in her brief that her mother is deceased. Watt admits to having called Hughes a “yellow bitch” in response. When Hughes reported this incident to Smith, Watt recounted to him what Hughes had said, and explained that she made the derogatory comment to Hughes in response to Hughes’s threat and because Hughes had used a hamper to block her access to the door. She also told him that Hughes “always says ‘black bitch’ when nobody [is] around .... [and that] [h]e [would] call [her] that when he s[aw her] coming, only in [her] earshot.” Watt also told Smith that she was upset that the company had only suspended Hughes rather than fire him, and that she was going to sue the company.</p>

She had taken an empty hamper when Hughes grabbed it from her, surprising Watt. He pulled on it and called Watt names, and she responded in kind. Watt shoved the hamper back at Hughes, who kicked it back at her “really hard.” He then began to approach her with his “fists balled up.” Watt grabbed a metal trolley<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and struck Hughes on his shoulder.

During Kraft’s investigation, Watt asserted that she had hit Hughes in self-defense because she was afraid for her safety. In his investigative report, Kraft noted that Watt alleged that incidents of harassment continued to occur throughout the summer. UniFirst claims that this investigation was the first time it had learned that Hughes had “continued to stare at her and make whispering comments” after he had been suspended. Watt denies that this was the first time, and points to the July 13 incident. Upon the completion of Kraft’s investigation, both Watt and Hughes were terminated from employment as a result of their September altercation.</p>

This alleged harassment was sufficiently severe as to alter Watt’s work environment, as demonstrated by the requirement that Watt had to be accompanied by another co-worker in the break room and whenever she would be in close proximity to Hughes. These facts, although disputed in part by Uni-First, are sufficient to satisfy the first five of the six criteria identified in <em>Forrest </em>and, as the Superior Court found, establish a prima facie claim of a hostile work environment.

However, the Supreme Court has yet to rule explicitly on employer liability for the actions of co-workers. <em>See Pa. State Police v. Suders, </em><a href="/us/542/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="542 U.S. 129" data-case-ids="5858697" data-case-paths="/us/542/0129-01">542 U.S. 129</a>, 143 n. 6, <a href="/us/542/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="542 U.S. 129" data-case-ids="5858697" data-case-paths="/us/542/0129-01">124 S.Ct. 2342</a>, <a href="/us/542/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="542 U.S. 129" data-case-ids="5858697" data-case-paths="/us/542/0129-01">159 L.Ed.2d 204</a> (2004). Some federal circuit courts, though, have recognized that under Title VII, employers may be directly liable for actions of co-workers based on a theory of negligence: ''[t]ypically, this involves a showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment, yet failed to take prompt action to stop it.” <em>Noviello v. City of Boston, </em><a href="/f3d/398/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="398 F.3d 76" data-case-ids="9027614" data-case-paths="/f3d/398/0076-01">398 F.3d 76</a>, 95 (1st Cir.2005).</p>

Summary judgment is appropriate where the undisputed material facts make it possible for a judge to conclude that a reasonable jury could not find that an employer’s actions were not prompt and appropriate, as was the case in <em>Forrest.
