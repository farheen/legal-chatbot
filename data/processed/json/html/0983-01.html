Mrs. Abdul-Haqq was pregnant with her third child, she was in normal health at the time, and she understood that all of her prenatal care would be provided by the nurse-midwives at the DCBC.</p>

The medical profession refers to this procedure as a vaginal birth after cesarean section (“VBAC”). In the course of the treatment she received from the DCBC, Mrs. Abdul-Haqq was advised of the increased risks that a VBAC posed to herself and her fetus. In October 2004 Mrs. Abdul-Haqq signed a consent form which, among other things, identified tearing of the uterus as a risk associated with a VBAC, and indicated that this risk increased if the patient had had more than one cesarean section.</p>

The DCBC nurse-midwives regularly assist women attempting a VBAC, and when they do so, the delivery occurs at the Washington Hospital Center.</p>

This title is somewhat misleading, however.

In addition to sharing the information on the form, Nurse-Midwife Alexander told Dr. Mio-dovnik that Mrs. Abdul-Haqq “desired a VBAC, that she wanted — very much wanted to have a vaginal birth.” According to Nurse-Midwife Alexander, Dr. Miodovnik expressed concern about the increased risks associated with a VBAC after two prior cesarean sections and advised her to reiterate the risks of the procedure to Mrs. Abdul-Haqq. She testified: “I remember that the patient really wanted a VBAC. He [Dr. Miodovnik] really wanted us to be sure to reiterate the risk to the patient and asked if she had been properly consented and that we do so again.” Nurse-Midwife Alexander resisted the suggestion that Dr. Miodovnik had “approved a VBAC for this patient....

After noting that “a review of binding authority on this court has revealed woefully little applicable law to answer the question of when a duty exists between a consulting physician and a patient,” the trial court examined the facts of the instant case in light of the decision in <em>Newborn v.

The court noted, among other factors, that Dr. Miodovnik never met Mrs. Abdul-Haqq; she was unaware of Dr. Mio-dovnik’s existence; “Dr. Miodovnik only considered and commented on plaintiffs medical care on one occasion”; the nurse-midwives were qualified to exercise independent judgment; and Dr. Miodovnik was not paid for the chart review. In light of these factors, the trial court concluded that Dr. Miodovnik’s chart review with Nurse-Midwife Alexander “was insufficient to create a duty vis-a-vis plaintiff Abdul-Haqq.”</p>

Imposing liability on a consulting physician under these circumstances would discourage consultation between health care providers. “Here, the District has seen fit under its regulations to allow nurse-midwives to provide standard primary care for pregnant women, without the aid of a doctor. Encouraging the nurse-midwives to consult with obstetrics professionals is in the public interest. Conversely, extending liability to such consultations, without more, contradicts that interest.

While it is true that, as between Dr. Miodovnik and Nurse-Midwife Alexander, only the doctor was qualified to <em>perform </em>a cesarean section, she was no less qualified than he to <em>speak with </em>the patient and <em>arrange for </em>the surgery. Nor was Dr. Miodovnik uniquely competent to discuss the risks of a VBAC with Mrs. Abdul-Haqq. He was entitled to rely upon Nurse-Midwife Alexander to discuss those risks with her own patient. <em>See Fowerbaugh v.

    <p id="b1039-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1039.12",1039,[133,1647,754,820]]]'>First, there is no dispute that Dr. Mio-dovnik’s review of the nurse-midwife’s notes on Ms. Abdul-Haqq was a routine review. Ms. Abdul-Haqq’s case was one of several presented at the meeting with Dr. Miodovnik, and nothing in the record suggests that anyone viewed this as a complicated case, a case of a type the nurse-midwives had not seen before, or a case involving risks with which the nurse-midwives were unfamiliar. Quite the contrary, the record shows that DCBC had given Ms. Abdul-Haqq a consent form that particularly addressed the risks associated not only with a first VBAC, but also with a vaginal birth after two cesarean sections.</p>
    <p id="b1039-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1039.15",1039,[932,264,751,189]]]'>Second, it is important to describe in detail what the DCBC consent form signed by Ms. Abdul-Haqq disclosed to her. It disclosed <em>inter alia </em>that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1039-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1039.16",1039,[971,479,718,815]]]'>A tear or opening in the uterus (womb) occurs in 5 to 10 women out of every 1,000 low risk women who try VBAC (0.5% to <em>1.0%)_Risks to the baby if there is a tear of the uterus are brain damage and death.... About 10% of the time the baby is harmed when the uterus </em>tears.... <em>The risk of your uterus tearing during labor is increased with any of the following: ...

Given what DCBC told its patient Ms. Abdul-Haqq on this form (which she signed), I see no basis for holding that Dr. Miodovnik’s differing perception of the risk a VBAC presented gave rise to the claimed duty to Ms. Abdul-Haqq.</p>
    <p id="b1039-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1039.18",1039,[935,1697,752,768]],["BL_1040.1",1040,[211,260,753,1117]]]'>Third, an important fact in this case is that Ms. Abdul-Haqq “very much wanted to have a vaginal birth.” That was her choice to make, notwithstanding the risks and notwithstanding the statement in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin that a trial of labor is “contraindicated” after a cesarean section. <em>Cf. Miller-McGee v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., </em><a href="/a2d/920/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="920 A.2d 430" data-case-ids="8323841" data-case-paths="/a2d/920/0430-01">920 A.2d 430</a>, 442 (D.C.2007) (rejecting, as premise of claim that patient would have had no choice but to consent to a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery, argument “that a c-section was not an alternative for appellant because ‘a <a id="p998" href="#p998" data-label="998" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*998</a>c-section is not offered to a patient as an alternative to vaginal delivery or assisted vaginal delivery unless for some reason surgery is medically necessary,’ ” since the argument “suggests that professional custom or practice alone [to the exclusion of patient self-determination] may dictate whether the obstetrical patient has an alternative”). And, the record does not contain standard-of-care testimony that allowing a trial of labor after two cesarean sections where the patient understands the risks and chooses that course violates the standard of care.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> So it cannot be assumed that Dr. Miodovnik had a duty— whether arising from knowledge that the nurse-midwives took his advice very seriously, or from knowledge that the nurse-midwives “did what he advised them to do,” or from his persuasive abilities — to make some type of effort to assure that the course of treatment was a cesarean.</p>

His recommended plan was that the “patient understand”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> the risk of VBAC after a second cesarean section (and that prophylactic antibiotics be given during labor, if the patient continued to want a trial of labor).

    <p id="b1040-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1040.9",1040,[1005,481,758,1492]],["BL_1041.1",1041,[121,252,755,450]]]'>Fifth, although plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that Dr. Miodovnik “fail[ed] to recognize the risks associated with allowing Plaintiff to deliver vaginally,” the record belies that claim. As to plaintiffs’ claim that Dr. Miodovnik “fail[ed] to give proper advice in consulting with [DCBC],” I believe Judge Fisher has aptly characterized the claim as one that Dr. Miodov-nik did not intervene — either by “ordering] the scheduled surgical delivery that Ms. Abdul-Haqq clearly required” (a quote from appellants’ brief), instructing the midwives not to assist Ms. Abdul-Haqq with a vaginal delivery, ordering that Ms. Abdul-Haqq be told that she must have a cesarean, following up with the nurse-midwives to make sure they had reiterated the risks to Ms. Abdul-Haqq, or, perhaps, making sure that Ms. Abdul-Haqq heard an opinion attributed to Dr. Miodovnik. I believe the majority opinion rightly declines to recognize a duty to do any of those things in light of the nurse-midwives’ independent responsibility for the care of their patients. I find persuasive the comments of <em>amici </em>American College of Nurse-Midwives and American Association of Birth Centers that, although <a id="p999" href="#p999" data-label="999" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*999</a>only a surgeon may perform a cesarean section, it is within the scope of practice of certified nurse midwives to “determin[e] whether a client requires a cesarean section.” And, as Judge Fisher correctly notes, “nothing in [the] MOUs either authorized or obligated Dr. Miodovnik to usurp control over the care and treatment of DCBC clients.”</p>
    <p id="b1041-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1041.4",1041,[125,737,754,1023]]]'>Finally, I respond to the observation in the dissent that Ms. Abdul-Haqq “readily agreed” to a cesarean section after Dr. Leslie advised her of the risk of attempting a vaginal delivery, and the statement that “had [such advice] been given timely, [it] likely would have averted the tragedy in this case.” I would observe (and I think anyone who has undergone labor can attest) that a woman’s readiness, once labor is upon her, to consent to a procedure she did not previously want, probably says more about the pain and anxiety attendant to labor than about the adequacy or inadequacy of previous warnings and advice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> More to the point, the fact that Ms. Abdul-Haqq readily agreed to a cesarean after she went into labor does not support a conclusion that Dr. Miodovnik owed a duty to her.</p>

Both the majority opinion and the dissent note Dr. Miodovnik's testimony that VBAC "under standard of care ... was not allowed ... [bjecause it’s clearly said, by ACOG, that if you have two caesarean sections without vaginal delivery, it is contraindicated of VBAC.” But Dr. Miodovnik was not testifying as a standard-of-care expert, and to say that a procedure is "contraindicated” is not necessarily to say that allowing it or performing it violates the standard of care. <em>Cf.

See <em>ante </em>note 5. Moreover, facts that go to the existence of a duty and what the standard of care is might overlap. But these are legally distinct issues; the former is a legal question for the court, and the latter, one of fact for the jury. In deciding that Dr. Miodovnik had no “duty to intervene” the majority has conflated these two concepts, and improperly decides a factual question that is for the jury and has yet to be addressed by the parties. In short, it has non-suited the case on the merits instead of deciding the legal issue of duty <em>vel non </em>that has been presented to the court.</p>

The case should be remanded so that the parties can develop the record on the standard of care, whether it was breached, and whether the breach caused the damages alleged.</p>

That was precisely the situation in this case. Nurse-Midwife Alexander testified that she orally presented Mrs. Abdul-Haqq’s medical history, including that she had two prior caesarean sections and no prior vaginal delivery. She then asked Dr. Miodovnik “for an assessment and plan” for Mrs. Abdul-Haqq, who wanted to have a vaginal birth. As an obstetrician, Dr. Miodovnik knew that, under published standards, a VBAC such as was proposed for Mrs. Abdul-Haqq “should not be attempted.” <em>ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 5k, </em>at 5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_12" id="ref_footnote_3_12">12</a> Reflecting his awareness of this standard and of his supervisory role with respect to a patient whose history raised a risk of serious “complications,” in his deposition Dr. Mio-dovnik stated that “it was strongly <em>recommended to the midwife that the patient trill have [a] repeat caesarean section.” </em>It is a disputed fact, however, whether he did so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_13" id="ref_footnote_3_13">13</a> Nurse-Midwife Alexander testified at deposition that had Dr. Miodovnik told her “in no uncertain terms that [Mrs. Abdul-Haqq] was not a candidate for a <a id="p1008" href="#p1008" data-label="1008" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1008</a>VBAC and should get a C-section,” “[w]e would have gone back to the client and spoken to her about his strong recommendation that she have a C-section, and given her that information as directly as possible and asked her to make the best decision for herself and her baby based on his recommendation.” What Nurse-Midwife Alexander said she would have done (if Dr. Miodovnik had so advised her) is what DCBC’s nurse-midwife expert, Carolyn Gregor, testified the standard of care required her to do. Dr. Miodovnik also testified that if a patient in Mrs. Abdul-Haqq’s condition continued to object to a caesarean section, he “expected the midwife to refer [her] to us, either the high-risk clinic and to myself, for further discussion,” and that either he or someone else in the high-risk clinic “could have persuaded [Mrs. Abdul-Haqq] to have a repeat caesarean section.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_14" id="ref_footnote_3_14">14</a> That did not happen, and Dr. Miodovnik testified that he did not follow-up. In short, the record contradicts the majority’s assertion that Nurse-Midwife Alexander “was no less qualified than [Dr. Miodovnik] to speak with the patient and arrange for the [caesarean section].” See <em>ante </em>page 994. Unlike in <em>Newborn, </em>Dr. Miodovnik’s testimony indicates his awareness that the nurse-midwives might not be capable of handling alone a complicated case such as the one presented by Mrs. Abdul-Haqq because of the importance of explaining the medical risks.

Similarly, the majority goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the “Council of the District of Columbia has recognized the independence of nurse-midwives,” who “may perform actions of nursing diagnosis and nursing treatment of alterations of the health status,” and “are qualified to assume primary responsibility for the care of their patients.” See <em>ante </em>pages 989 (quoting D.C.Code § 8-1201.02(2) (2001); 17 DCMR § 5800.1 (2002)).

As already discussed, what is most relevant to the question of duty are Dr. Miodovnik’s contractual obligation to DCBC, his established consulting relationship with the DCBC nurse-midwives, and his actual collaboration with the nurse-midwives in the care and supervision of Mrs. Abdul-Haqq’s treatment during pregnancy in preparation for delivery. In this case, the record shows that even though licensed and legally authorized to act independently, the nurse-midwives did not retain complete control of Mrs. Abdul-Haqq’s treatment and that they sought and followed Dr. Miodovnik’s recommendations on her treatment plan as a matter of fact. To recognize that Dr. Miodovnik owed a duty to Mrs. Abdul-Haqq in the circumstances of this case in no way threatens the standing of the nurse-midwives who indisputably themselves also owed a duty of reasonable care to her.

The analysis I have undertaken is consistent with the approach taken by the ACOG Committee on Ethics Opinion, <em>Seeking and Giving Consultation, </em>cited by <em>amici curiae </em>(American College of Nurse-Midwives and American Association of Birth Centers), which recognizes several levels of interaction between nurse-midwives and physicians in ascending order: from “professional dialogue” to three levels of “formal” consultation, which in turn range from a “single-visit consultation” to “continuing collaborative care” to “transfer of primary clinical responsibility.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_20" id="ref_footnote_3_20">20</a> ACOG Committee on Ethics, <em>ACOG Committee Opinion </em>— Seeking <em>and Giving Consultation, </em>No. 365, May 2007, at 1-2 [hereinafter ACOG Ethics Opinion], Where in that spectrum the consultation at issue in this case falls is a subject for expert testimony, but there is evidence to suggest that the consultation had between Dr. Miodov-nik and Nurse-Midwife Alexander was not, as <em>amici </em>suggest, at the least-involved end of the spectrum of “professional dialogue” which “does not constitute a formal consultation or establish a patient-consultant relationship.” <em>See id. </em>at 1. According to the ACOG Ethics Opinion, “professional dialogue” occurs in situations where “clinicians share their opinions and knowledge” and the consulted clinician is “asked a simple question and he or she does not talk with or examine the patient” and “does not make an entry in the patient’s medical record.” <em>Id. </em>Here, Dr. Miodov-nik was not asked “a simple question” but asked for an “assessment and plan” for the patient, and he did make an entry on Mrs. Abdul-Haqq’s medical chart.</p>

      <em>Amici </em>express a concern that to recognize the duty of a consulting physician to the patients of nurse-midwives would adversely affect access to quality care because it would “diminish the willingness of OBs to consult with midwives.” Just as I do not question the professional independence and qualifications of nurse-midwives, I have no reason to doubt that they provide an important and welcome addition to the range of obstetrical and gynecological services available to women. But this argument goes too far, for it implicitly proposes that a special regime of legal liability should be devised to shield doctors who consult with nurse-midwives. As the majority notes, the legislature “has not spoken directly to the issues before us.” See <em>ante </em>page 990. In a field as comprehensively defined and regulated as is the practice of nurse-midwifery in the District of Columbia, which we are told is “in the forefront in developing midwifery practice laws and regulations,” it is particularly appropriate that any public policy-based exception to the usual rule of legal liability should come from the legislature and not be devised by the courts. An important part of any decision based on public policy would take into account that, according to <em>amici, </em>a high proportion (70%) of these patients are “considered vulnerable by virtue of their age, education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity or location of residence <a id="p1014" href="#p1014" data-label="1014" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1014</a>.... [and that] over one-third of [certified nurse-midwife] clients reside in areas where a higher-than-average number of people are living below the poverty level.” A legislative body could gather the information necessary and has the procedures to evaluate competing considerations in a field as fraught with trade-offs in the allocation of resources and costs as health care. I see no reason, however, why these patients should as a matter of law be entitled to less accountability from a consulting physician than a patient who is able to pay full fare to a physician who similarly consults with another physician.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_21" id="ref_footnote_3_21">21</a>

But we may not assume that comprehensive informed consent was obtained from Mrs. Abdul-Haqq in this case simply because she signed the DCBC consent form early in her pregnancy. In essence, her claim is that she was not given proper medical advice, and therefore was not able to decide for herself on an informed basis. Mrs. Abdul-Haqq testified that she had understood the risk of uterine rupture was “slight,” and Nurse-Midwife Alexander confirmed that after the VBAC consent form was signed early in the pregnancy there was no further discussion of the risks with her. The record bears that out, for when Dr. Leslie told Mrs. Abdul-Haqq at» the hospital that a caesarean section was indicated in her case because of the risks posed by attempting a vaginal delivery in light of her medical history, Mrs. Abdul-Haqq readily agreed to a caesarean section after obtaining assurance from Dr. Leslie that her bladder would be protected from injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_22" id="ref_footnote_3_22">22</a> Such advice, had it been given timely, likely would have averted the tragedy in this case.
