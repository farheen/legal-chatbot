    <p id="b1065-21" data-blocks='[["BL_1065.22",1065,[964,804,751,745]]]'>The plaintiff, Vincent Battaglia, was injured on August 15, 1976, in an automobile accident in Delaware while he was a passenger in a vehicle owned and operated by Sheila Y. Summers. Ms. Summers at that time was a resident of the State of Maryland, and her automobile was registered in Maryland. Her automobile insurance policy was issued in Maryland by The Nationwide Insurance Company, the defendant, which is also authorized to transact business in Delaware. The terms of this policy provide, inter alia, for personal injury protection benefits (PIP) in the sum of $2,500.00, the minimum coverage permitted under Maryland law.</p>

Further, plaintiff claims that he has incurred, and will continue to incur, lost wages and, possibly, medical expenses far in excess of the $2,500.00 already paid him by Nationwide.</p>

Plaintiff subsequently moved for summary judgment on the grounds that, under 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2118(7), Nationwide was required to pay him for lost wages ánd medical expenses in excess of $2,500.00 and up to $10,000.00, the minimum PIP coverage under Delaware law, 21 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2118(a)(2)b.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We reverse. We find that former Section 2118(7) of the Motor Vehicle Code did not operate to impose Delaware’s minimum PIP insurance benefits requirement on vehicles not registered in the State. Thus, the Superior Court erred in subjecting the insurance company to Delaware’s $10,000.00 PIP minimum rather than the $2,500.00 minimum required by Maryland.</p>

Each of the subparagraph classes is dependent on the introductory subsection 2118(a) and its reference to vehicles “required to be registered in this State” and the required Delaware insurance. Section 2118(7), on the other hand, addresses itself to a form-filing requirement of insurance companies doing business in Delaware. It cannot be construed as an eligibility provision creating an independent basis of entitlement for passengers in vehicles, registered and insured out-of-state, just because the insurer is also doing business in Delaware. The language, in terms of form filing, is simply not framed to achieve such an eligibility expansion.</p>

That Court rejected the contention that the language “when the vehicle is operated in the state” altered or extended the section’s express eligibility rules. It went on to interpret subsection (7) to mean:</p>

This conclusion is supported by legislative history of § 2118. When subsection (1) was added in March 1976, the eligibility provisions already stood. The District Court in <em>Deel </em>concluded, and we agree, that, if the General Assembly had intended to create a new eligibility provision, it would have done so by amending § 2118(aX2). The synopsis attached to the bill does not suggest any intent to extend eligibility. See House Bill No. 808; 60 <em>Del.

If it were to apply, insurance rates for companies insuring drivers in other states would have to be computed on the assumption that each car owner entering this State would have the Delaware minimum PIP benefits. Appellant submits, and the District Court in <em>Deel </em>expressly stated, that the necessary result of such application would be to impose the unreasonable and economically unfeasible burden on those insurance companies which have a multistate business of adjusting their premiums on a world-wide basis “to take into account the likelihood that [they] might be required to pay-benefits in accord with § 2118(a)(2) and (3) since any non-Delaware registered vehicle which [they] insured might possibly be involved in an accident while passing through Delaware.” <em>Deel v.
