    <p id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.6",83,[194,665,751,849]]]'>On April 30, 1980, the District of Columbia Police and Firemen’s Retirement and Relief Board (hereinafter the Retirement Board) concluded that Officer Jack T. Proulx is not permanently disabled for the performance of duty as a policeman and, therefore is not eligible for disability retirement under D.C. Code 1980 Supp., § 4-527(1). In so concluding, the Retirement Board rejected the June 7, 1979 recommendation of the Board of Police and Fire Surgeons that Proulx is “permanently disabled for duty.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Petitioner argues that neither the Retirement Board’s finding of no permanent disability nor their finding of no disability for the grade or class last occupied is supported by substantial evidence. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm.</p>

Both petitioner and prisoner fell to the floor and petitioner reported “sharp pains to the lower portion of my back.” This occurred on February 20, 1977. Petitioner was placed on sick leave until August 1977 when he returned to full duty. Experiencing greater pain, however, he was placed on sick leave in late December 1977. He returned to full, duty in mid-January 1978. In June of 1978, he was placed on sick leave until September when he returned to work on a limited duty basis for just a few days, being again placed on sick leave on September 22, 1978. He has not returned to duty since that date.</p>

While the inference that his failure to perform was due to his own motivation and not because he was unable to do so is not the only inference possible, it is certainly a legitimate and reasonable one.</p>

Straight leg raising test equivocal (ruptured disc (diagnosed) via epidural venography).” The epidural venography, however, had been given before the February recommendation so that the Board of Surgeon’s reversal would seem to have been based on a finding of “pain” and on “equivocal” test results.</p>
