National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (“National Union,”) provided this policy. Before renewal, National Union informed DVI that the new premium would rise to $415,000, a 56.6% increase over the previous year. At about the same time, an independent insurance broker, Commerce National Insurance Services, (“Commerce,”) offered to assist DVI with its insurance needs. Facing a significant premium increase from National Union, DVI accepted the offer from Commerce, and instructed Commerce to seek better terms with Zurich. Commerce complied with the instructions. On April 16, 2003, Zurich offered to Commerce a “Directors and Officers Liability and Reimbursement Policy” that provided DVI with a $10 million “Aggregate Limit of Liability” policy, and required a premi<a id="p767" href="#p767" data-label="767" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*767</a>um of $875,000. The following day, Commerce accepted Zurich’s offer and instructed Zurich to bind DVI as of April 25, [2003], “per [Zurich’s] attached quote letter.” Pursuant to these instructions, Zurich bound DVI under a “Financial Institutions Excess Insurance Policy.” However, the binder was inconsistent with the original agreement because it omitted the word “Aggregate,” and merely stated that the limit of liability was $10 million. Subsequently, Zurich issued a revised binder on April 25, 2003. Unlike the original binder, the revised binder specified a $10 million “Aggregate Limit of Liability, and was consistent with the original agreement.” ... Finally, on August 4, 2003, Zurich issued its formal Financial Institution Directors and Officers Liability and Reimbursement Policy, No. EOC-5260613-00. However, the policy contained another inconsistency because it stated that the $10 million limit of liability applied to “Each Loss.”</blockquote>

The dispute in this case arises from the communications and relationships between three main parties: 1) DVI, the insured; 2) Commerce, the insurance broker; and 3) Zurich, the insurer. From these parties’ interactions arose a contract in the form of an insurance policy issued by Zurich to insure DVI.</p>
    <p id="b814-7" data-blocks='[["BL_814.5",814,[230,1893,751,499]],["BL_814.6",814,[1031,292,753,402]]]'>¶ 5 Analyzing the facts of this case temporally, we begin with the facts leading up to DVI’s decision to procure a new insurance policy to insure its directors and officers (D &amp; O Policy) for the 2003/04 policy period. From approximately 1996 to 2003, DVI had a D &amp; O Policy through its prior insurance broker, Hilb, Rogal and Hamilton (HRH). For the 2002/03 policy period, HRH had procured for DVI a D &amp; O Policy with National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (hereinafter referred to as either “National Union” or “AIG”) for which DVI paid a premium of $265,000. Reproduced Record (R.) at 388a. It is not disputed that this policy included a $10,000,000 aggregate limit of liability. R. at 388a.</p>
    <p id="b814-10" data-blocks='[["BL_814.9",814,[1030,728,753,1020]]]'>¶ 6 This policy was due to expire on April 25, 2003, and in the months preceding the expiration, DVI and Commerce began discussing the possibility of Commerce procuring a D &amp; O Policy for DVI. On March 18, 2003, Larry Arnold, DVI’s Tax and Insurance Manager, wrote to Matthew Gardner, one of the Commerce representatives working with DVI on this matter, accepting Commerce’s offer to review DVI’s existing coverage. R. at 419a. Accordingly, the letter included enclosures amongst which were DVI’s then existing National Union Policy. As stated above, the National Union Policy that DVI sent to Commerce included a “Policy Aggregate Limit of Liability” of $10 million. R. at 352a. The policy also stated that this limit would hereinafter be referred to as simply the “Limit of Liability.” R. at 352a.</p>

R. at 432a. On March 10, 2003, after further discussions between Commerce and DVI, Mr. Gardner wrote an email to Mr. Arnold confirming that Commerce “was authorized by DVT to approach our selected markets with a firm order at a <a id="p769" href="#p769" data-label="769" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*769</a>premium of $375,000 for $10 million in D &amp; O coverage, effective 4/25/03.” R. at 1067a. The email also confirmed that the new insurance “must offer full continuity of coverage” with the National Union Policy. R. at 1067a. Thus, faced with at least a $150,000 premium increase from National Union, DVI decided to utilize Commerce’s services to see whether it could procure a D &amp; O policy through another insurer at a substantial discount.</p>
    <p id="b815-5" data-blocks='[["BL_815.4",815,[111,857,755,1643]]]'>¶ 8 Commerce then approached Zurich about providing a D &amp; O Policy for DVI to replace its National Union Policy. On April 7, 2003, Rick Baehr, another Commerce representative, wrote to Stephen Scheier, a Zurich representative, requesting that Zurich review DVI’s then existing National Union Policy in an effort to ascertain whether Zurich could provide a D &amp; O Policy. R. at 435a. Enclosed with this letter was a copy of the National Union Policy that stated that the policy had a $10 million aggregate limit of liability. R. at 435a. On April 16, 2003, Mr. Scheier emailed Mr. Gardner a quote in the form of an attachment. R. at 472a. The quoted premium was for $375,000 and the quote stated that the “Aggregate Limit of Liability” was $10 million. R. at 474a. On that same date, Mr. Gardner sent an email to Mr. Arnold informing him that Zurich would be willing to provide “$10 million in D &amp; O coverage to DVI.” R. at 479a. There was no mention of the words “Aggregate Limit of Liability” in this email. It is undisputed that after Mr. Arnold received this email from Commerce, he authorized it to bind the coverage with Zurich. R. at 408a. On April 17, 2003, Mr. Gardner emailed Mr. Scheier to bind the coverage “per your attached quote letter.” R. at 481a.</p>

R. at 483a. This binder had other mistakes as well in that it stated that it was a Financial Institutions Excess Policy rather than a D &amp; O Policy, and the word “retention” was misspelled. R. at 483a. Commerce forwarded the Original Binder to DVI. R. at 1423a. Shortly thereafter, Zurich issued a Revised Binder correcting the aforementioned errors and adding the word “Aggregate” to the “Limit of Liability.” R. at 492a. The coverage dates for the Revised Binder were April 25, 2003 to June 17, 2003. R. at 492a.</p>

R. at 1350a. Most importantly, this one-page letter informed DVI that the “Annual Aggregate Limit” of liability was $10 million. R. at 1350a. A few days later, Mr. Baehr again wrote to Mr. Arnold, this time attaching the Revised Binder, which stated that the “Aggregate Limit of Liability” was $10 million, and invoicing DVI for the premium, which it ultimately paid. R. at 487a-92a.</p>

R. at 512a. The Declarations Page of the Zurich Policy stated that the $10 million Limit of Liability applied to “Each ‘Loss.’ ” R. at 514a. Immediately below this, there was a space in which to set forth the Limit of Liability for “Each ‘Policy Period,’ ” which is the equivalent of <a id="p770" href="#p770" data-label="770" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*770</a>the Aggregate Limit of Liability. R. at 514a. This space was left blank. R. at 514a.

Commerce sought to obtain this insurance from Zurich, but Zurich declined. R. at 834a. Ultimately, four other insurance companies declined to provide the coverage. R. at 832a. However, Commerce was successful at procuring this policy through Chubb in an amount of $5 million. Commerce notified Mr. Arnold on May 25, 2003 that it had been successful in obtaining a $5 million D &amp; O Policy from Chubb in “excess of the Zurich $10,000,000.” R. at 832a.</p>

It listed the Zurich Policy as the “Primary Insurance” with an “Annual Aggregate Limit of Liability” of $10 million and it listed the Chubb Policy as the “Excess Insurance” with a limit of “$5,000,000 Excess of $10,000,000 Annual Aggregate Limit of Liability.” R. at 509a.</p>

As support for this claim, Trustee points to the Declarations Page of the Zurich Policy which did not include a Limit of Liability for Each Policy Period, and the various other documents which neglect to mention that the Zurich Policy’s $10 million Limit of Liability was in the aggregate.</p>

Furthermore, despite receiving numerous communications and documents from both Commerce and Zurich stating that the Zurich Policy had a $10 million aggregate limit, DVI never raised any concerns with either Commerce or Zurich.</p>
    <p id="b818-25" data-blocks='[["BL_818.25",818,[1013,1649,756,869]]]'>¶ 20 We note that much of the Trustee’s brief is devoted to attacking the agency relationship between DVI and Commerce. The Trustee claims at various points that Commerce breached its duties as an agent for DVI, and therefore, none of Commerce’s “conduct should be imputed to DVI.” Brief for Appellant at 27. Again, the Trustee is raising an argument that is unrelated to whether the true agreement between DVI and Zurich was for a No-Aggregate Limit of Liability policy. None of the alleged breaches of duties that the Trustee cites relate to the expectation of the parties on the issue of whether they were contracting for a No-Aggregate Limit of Liability policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p773" href="#p773" data-label="773" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*773</a>¶ 21 In conclusion, there is overwhelming and undisputed evidence that demonstrates that DVI sought out and entered into a D &amp; 0 Policy with a $10 million aggregate limit. The Trustee has presented this Court with no evidence that creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding DVI’s intent and expectation to procure a D &amp; 0 Policy without an .aggregate limit. While the record before us certainly reveals many mistakes and omissions, it does not contain evidence that would demonstrate that the true agreement between DVI and Zurich was for a policy without an aggregate limit. Consequently, since the record establishes beyond dispute that DVI purchased a D &amp; 0 Policy with a $10 aggregate limit, Zurich was entitled to a reformation of the policy to make it conform to the parties’ true agreement.</p>

We note that the record shows that the premium of $415,000 was the result of some negotiation. In fact, a National Union renewal notice, dated April 7, 2003, indicated that the premium would be at least $474,990. R. at 421a. This was apparently lowered to $450,000. R. at 435a. Then again, on April 17, 2003, after DVI had received the Zurich quote, Donna Ford from HRB wrote an email to Mr. Arnold al DVI telling him that AIG (National Union) was willing to lower its premium to $415,000.

While the trial court addressed tire agency issue in its opinion, we conclude that an analysis of the agency relationship between Commerce and DVI is unnecessary in regard to <a id="p773" href="#p773" data-label="773" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*773</a>the present dispute. It would be relevant here were we to conclude that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether DVI’s intent and expectations were to enter into a no-aggregate limit policy. Thus, in such a scenario, Commerce’s solicitation of a D &amp; O Policy with an aggregate limit of liability from Zurich could potentially be imputed to DVI notwithstanding its contrary intent and expectations. However, we have here determined that there is no genuine issue of material fact that DVI itself sought out and agreed to a D &amp; O Policy with an aggregate limit. <em>See Carrozza v. Greenbaum, </em><a href="/pa/591/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="591 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="3016472" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0196-01">591 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/pa/591/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="916 A.2d 553" data-case-ids="3016472,8333289" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0196-01,/a2d/916/0553-01">916 A.2d 553</a>, 569 (2007) (stating that an appellate court may affirm on any basis). While Commerce obviously brokered the transaction between DVI and Zurich, as stated above, the Trustee did not cite any evidence that would show that Commerce somehow misrepresented DVI’s intention to purchase a D &amp; O Policy with a $10 million aggregate limit.</p>
