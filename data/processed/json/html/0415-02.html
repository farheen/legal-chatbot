On September 5, 2001, the trial court issued an order issuing a rule to show cause against the Commonwealth to show why Appellant’s post-sentence motions should not be granted. The rule was made returnable at a hearing to be held on October 15, 2001. The trial court mistakenly scheduled the hearing after the 120-day limit to rule on post-sentence motions as prescribed by Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(3)(a). On September 26, 2001, 125 days after the initial post-sentence motion, Appellant filed a motion for a 30-day extension pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(3)(b). The trial court granted the motion on September 28, 2001, and noted that it was required by law to decide the motion by October 27, 2001. Later, on October 24, 2001, the trial court issued an order denying the post-sentence motions by operation of law. Afterwards, the trial court filed yet another order on October 31, 2001, amending its September 28, 2001, order to state that it was required to make a decision on the motions by October 22, 2001. On November 16, 2001, Appellant filed a notice of appeal to this Court. Thereafter, on December 11, 2001, the trial court ordered Appellant to file a 1925(b) concise statement of matters complained of on appeal. Appellant filed the 1925(b) statement on December 26, 2002, and the trial court authored an opinion, addressing the issues Appellant raised in the 1925(b) statement.</p>

The record indicates that the judgment of sentence was imposed on May 14, 2001. Appellant filed his post-sentence motions in a timely fashion on May 24, 2001, within 10 days of the judgment of sentence. <em>See </em>Pa. R.Crim.P. 720(A)(1). Mechanically, the run-date for purposes of Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(3)(a) was September 21, 2001, which was 120 days from the filing of the post-sentence motions on May 24, 2001. Appellant’s petition for extension was not filed until September 26, 2001. Consequently, the trial court was without power to rule on the petition for extension because the original post-sentence motion had already been deemed denied by law pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(3)(a). <em>See Commonwealth v. Santone, </em><a href="/a2d/757/0963-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="757 A.2d 963" data-case-ids="11243894" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0963-01">757 A.2d 963</a> (Pa.Super.2000) (holding trial court’s modification of sentence after 120-day period to decide post-sentence motions a nullity because post-sentence motions deemed denied by operation of law). The trial court entered an order granting the motion for extension, but did not act on the motion. The trial court then entered an order on October 24, 2001, stating that the motion was “deemed denied by operation of law.” Since the post-sentence motions were deemed denied by operation of law on September 21, 2001, the trial court’s orders granting an extension of time and <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>denying the post-sentence motions by operation of law on October 24th were a legal nullity because the trial court’s jurisdiction ended September 21st. Therefore, Appellant had 30 days from September 21st to appeal. Thus, the November 16th appeal was untimely. However, we have held that we will address an otherwise untimely appeal if fraud or breakdown in the trial court’s processes resulted in an untimely appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, in <em>Commonwealth v. Braykovich, </em><a href="/pa-super/444/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="444 Pa.

Our decision in <em>Braykovich </em>is instructive in our analysis of whether a breakdown of the processes of the trial court occurred in this case. In <em>Braykovich, </em>Braykovich filed a timely post-sentence motion on April 19, 1994. <em>Braykovich, </em><a href="/pa-super/444/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="664 A.2d 133" data-case-ids="723988,7862671" data-case-paths="/pa-super/444/0397-01,/a2d/664/0133-01">664 A.2d at 135</a>.

The trial court’s grant of this petition to extend on September 28, 2001, was a nullity because it was deemed denied by operation of law on September 21, 2001. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(3)(a); <em>see also Santone, </em><a href="/a2d/757/0963-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="757 A.2d 963" data-case-ids="11243894" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0963-01">757 A.2d at 964</a>.

This error was compounded by the trial court’s original error of scheduling the September 5th rule returnable after the 120-day period for decision on post-sentence motions and was further compounded by the trial court’s erroneous grant of an extension of time on the post-sentence motions and subsequent order deeming the post-sentence motions denied by operation of law (which were both entered after the 120-day period). This order is important in two respects. First, it informs a defendant that the 30-day time limit for direct appeal has begun, and, second, it appraises the defendant of his rights on appeal. We are unable to ignore the failure of the trial court to inform Appellant of his appeal rights, and we are constrained to find that it was the breakdown of the processes of the trial court that caused Appellant’s untimely appeal. Accordingly, we will address the merits of this appeal.</p>

Further, Appellant failed to meet the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to call a witness. Turning to the first prong of the requirements, we note that although it is arguable that the witnesses existed by virtue of their statements, these statements do not meet the second and fourth prongs of the test because they do not indicate whether the individuals were available and willing to cooperate with the defense. Nor do these statements indicate that the persons who authored them were known to counsel. Evidently, at the beginning of trial, trial counsel indicated that he was going to present Appellant and two witnesses in his case-in-chief. N.T. Trial, 3/9/2001, at 5. However, besides Appellant, the other witnesses were not identified. Thus, the putative witnesses identified in Appellant’s brief may or may not be the witnesses trial counsel intended to call. Finally, it is not at all clear that the absence of these statements prejudiced Appellant so as to deny him a fair trial. These statements merely recount a version of the facts as supposedly observed by the individuals who authored the statements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This Court will not grant relief based on <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>an allegation that a certain witness may have testified in the absence of an affidavit from that witness to show that the witness would, in fact, testify. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s claim attacks the discretionary aspects of his sentence. There is no absolute right to direct appellate review of a discretionary sentencing claim, and a party wishing to raise such an issue must petition this Court for permission to appeal and demonstrate that there is a substantial question that the sentence is inappropriate. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(b); <em>see also Commonwealth v.
