The purchaser went bankrupt shortly thereafter and the property <a id="p1455" href="#p1455" data-label="1455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1455</a>was foreclosed. Morris DeLee (“Morris”), Sol’s brother, purchased the property at public auction held by the holder of the second mortgage. Sometime between 1974, when Morris purchased the property, and 1976, Morris orally promised to give the property to Sol. Morris argued that the promise was made only as a brotherly gesture. Sol insisted, and the district court agreed, that in exchange for the property, Sol promised to pay off farm equipment used in connection with the property.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[147,665,1123,453]]]'>The equipment which allegedly formed the basis for consideration was purchased by Sol when he owned the ranch, and he personally guaranteed the loans on the equipment. Sol testified that when Morris took over the ranch in 1974, there was a considerable balance remaining on the equipment contracts. Sol assertedly had title to a portion of the equipment and, in exchange for 640 acres to be conveyed to him by Morris, agreed to leave the equipment on the property and pay off the remaining balance due on the contracts. Sol’s ex-wife testified that Sol did make payments on the equipment.</p>
    <p id="b561-6" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[150,1123,1120,314]]]'>Morris, however, testified that Sol no longer had title to the equipment and that Sol, and any other creditor asserting rights to the equipment, had lost title through the bankruptcy proceedings. According to Morris, when he owned the property, Sol’s obligation to pay the balance owing on the equipment continued by reason of his personal guarantee and irrespective of the bankruptcy.</p>
    <p id="b561-7" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[152,1443,1123,585]]]'>Although Sol completed payment on the equipment sometime in 1978, he made no demand on the property until Morris filed suit against Sol on an unrelated matter in 1990. Sol then filed his counterclaim for the 640 acres, which he claimed Morris was obligated to convey to him. Sol allegedly had refrained from demanding the acreage previously because of his substantial indebtedness and the fear that creditors would have “gobbled up the land.” Additionally, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sol obtained loans from Morris in amounts totaling $100,000, which Sol was unable to repay. It was Sol’s default on the loans from Morris that prompted the latter to file the action against Sol. The counterclaim at issue here was filed by Sol in response to the action filed by Morris.</p>
    <p id="b561-8" data-blocks='[["BL_561.7",561,[155,2034,1122,222]]]'>The district court ruled that Sol’s promise to make payments on the equipment was consideration for Morris’s promise to convey 640 acres of land to Sol.

The trial court’s finding of consideration for the agreement to convey the 640 acres was based upon the testimony of Sol and his ex-wife, and the exhibits admitted at trial. Morris relied solely upon his own testimony as evidence. At trial, neither party oifered documentation of ownership at the time of the agreement. Thus, the district court was left to make a finding based upon the submitted evidence. Although documented evidence of ownership would have been useful to the district court’s determination, the submitted evidence was legally sufficient to support the district court’s finding of consideration.</p>
    <p id="b562-8" data-blocks='[["BL_562.7",562,[358,1357,1122,311]]]'>Morris nevertheless insists that the district court erred in refusing to grant his post-trial motions. In support of the motions, Morris submitted several exhibits documenting the ownership of the equipment. Morris excuses his failure to introduce the evidence at trial by noting that the documents were “difficult to locate because of their age,” and because of Sol’s “unanticipated testimony” that he paid money to save the equipment for Morris.</p>

The <em>Locken </em>court also held that “[a] constructive trust will arise and affect property acquisitions under circumstances where (1) a confidential relationship exists between the parties; (2) retention of legal title by the holder thereof against another would be inequitable; and (3) the existence of such a trust is essential to the effectuation of justice.” <em><a href="/nev/98/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="98 Nev. 369" data-case-ids="2416666" data-case-paths="/nev/98/0369-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/nev/98/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="98 Nev. 369" data-case-ids="2416666" data-case-paths="/nev/98/0369-01">at 372</a>, <a href="/nev/98/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="98 Nev. 369" data-case-ids="2416666" data-case-paths="/nev/98/0369-01">650 P.2d at 805</a>.</p>

Sol refrained from demanding the property until 1989 mainly for self-serving reasons. He had so many debts that if he had made such a demand, the property would have been “gobbled up” by creditors. Additionally, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sol was seeking and obtaining loans from Morris totaling $100,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> If Sol had demanded the property during that time, he likely would have experienced greater difficulty in securing the loans from Morris.</p>
