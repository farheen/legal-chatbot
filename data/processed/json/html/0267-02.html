Tung contends that the trial court erred in holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over one stockbroker, appellee W.T. Cabe &amp; Co., Inc., and that Tung, by failing to object during the arbitration hearing to the participation of one of the arbitrators, had waived any claim arising from bias or prejudice of the arbitrator.

(Loeb). On the basis of alleged unauthorized action by both Cabe and Loeb in 1974, Tung lost over seven thousand dollars which he never recouped. In August 1974 Tung wrote to the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) in Washington, D.C. requesting assistance in obtaining redress for the failure of Cabe and Loeb to sell certain stock as he had directed. In 1979 Tung submitted a claim against Cabe and Loeb to the NASD for resolution by arbitration.</p>

The arbitration panel issued an award on October 15, 1980, finding that Loeb was not liable to Tung, and that although Cabe was liable, Tung had failed to mitigate his damages and, consequently, no damages were due. Tung’s request for reconsideration of the award was denied on December 17, 1980. On March 13, 1981, Tung filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-4311(a) (1981);<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the motion was denied on September 28, 1983.</p>

Although it is unclear from the record<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> how the award was delivered to Tung, section 35(c) of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure requires the Director of Arbitration to serve a copy of the award by registered or certified mail upon all parties, or their counsel at the address of record with the Association, or personally upon the parties, or by filing or delivering the award in such manner as may be authorized by law. We have no reason to conclude, and Tung does not suggest, that this procedure was not followed. <em>Cf. Toomey v.

Therefore, Tung should have filed his motion to vacate long before March 13, 1981, which was five months after the date of the award. Because he did not, his motion was time barred. <em>See Orange v.

By noting that he filed a claim for reconsideration after receipt of the award and that his claim was not decided until December 17, 1980, he suggests, however, that the request for reconsideration tolled the statutory time for filing a motion to vacate. The NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure does not contain a procedure for reconsideration or clarification of an award;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> on <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>the contrary, it provides in Section 35 that an award issued pursuant to the Code “is deemed final and not subject to review or appeal.” This case is therefore distinguishable from those in which an agency’s procedures provide for reconsideration or rehearing or leave genuine and reasonable doubt as to whether an award may be subject to further agency review. <em>See In re A.B., </em><a href="/a2d/486/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="486 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="7920070" data-case-paths="/a2d/486/1167-01">486 A.2d 1167</a> (D.C.1984) and cases cited.

Tung had also previously been involved in NASD arbitration. As the trial court pointed out to Tung’s counsel during argument on the motion to vacate, the usual procedure is to note an appeal and then request that the appeal be held in abeyance until the motion to recon sider is decided. <em>See Smith v.
