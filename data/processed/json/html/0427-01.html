    <p id="A3S" data-blocks='[["BL_463.8",463,[950,549,758,1481]]]'>After the phase one liability bench trial, the trial judge made oral factual findings showing the following events. Beginning on January 13, 1992, around 8 p.m., a nearby resident “saw three tiny rivulets of water near a curb at 21st and M [Streets].” She immediately called the Water Bureau. The matter was assigned to Mr. Thomas Mosley, a member of the investigative crew that worked the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. Around 11 p.m. that same evening, two members of the District of Columbia Fire Department, who passed by the 21st and M Street intersection, observed “water bubbling out of a manhole cover.” The water had “reaeh[ed] a height of perhaps one inch,” and had begun to flow across the street. One of the firefighters alerted the Fire Department, and an employee of the Fire Department’s communication division called the Water Bureau. The message from the call was forwarded to Mr. Mosley. Mr. Mosley took no action on either call before his shift ended at midnight, even though he “passed through the intersection of 21st and M” during his shift. Instead, he responded to other calls which did not have the same priority as those relating to the intersection of 21st and M.</p>

They saw water bubbling out of the manhole cover at a height of one and one half to two inches, and began to search for a leak by “sounding” six of fourteen valves and several fire hydrants in the intersection. After additional investigation, which involved pumping water out of the manhole and sounding a valve in the manhole, the two men were unable to locate the source of the leak. <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>Mr. Duncan decided that the matter could await further investigation until the day-shift came on duty. The two men then replaced the manhole cover and proceeded to other jobs, which the trial judge subsequently determined had less priority than the problem at 21st and M. Later on January 14, around 4:45 a.m., the dispatcher at the Water Bureau informed Mr. Duncan that several calls had been received from persons who complained about no water in the 21st and M Street area. Mr. Duncan returned to the area and “discovered the main break at 21st and [M] Streets.” Several minutes later, around 5 a.m., one of the firefighters who had called the Water Bureau earlier to report the problem at 21st and M Streets, went to the area to ascertain what was causing reports of low water pressure. “[H]e saw that the intersection of'21st and M Streets was covered with water to the* extent that it was not safe to drive through. There was a geyser of water 12 to 15 feet high in the intersection .... ” Shutting the water off in the area required the closing of forty-eight valves, a process that took four or five hours. The trial court determined that if the valves had been closed before the rupture occurred, the task could have been accomplished in one to two hours.</p>

He responded “yes” to questions as to whether he was “[f]amiliar with the policies of [the] Philadelphia'Water Company during [his] tenure there with respect to finding .., water leaks and resolving them,” and whether he “compare[d] those [policies] with other cities ... through contractors” he dealt with from New York, New Jersey and Delaware.

That’s a large leak.” He was then asked: “[W]hat would a reasonable water company do when confronted with that?” He stated: “Shut that system down or shut that main and find out where the leak is.” He opined, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that it was unreasonable for the District: (1) to have conducted no investigation of the leak at 21st and M Streets for four hours after being informed of its existence; (2) not to have found a leak of such magnitude; and (3) to leave the investigation to the day shift which arrived seven hours later.

Mr. Cochran testified, in part, that general procedure for investigating joint leaks or water main breaks required the investigative crew to sound or listen to valves and hydrants in order to isolate the source of the leak. Furthermore, if a water main proved to be the source of the leak, investigative crews could use their own discretion with regard to shutting off a twelve inch water main. If the water main were larger than twelve inches, however, the crew would have to obtain authorization from a division or bureau chief. On cross examination, Mr. Cochran stated that if leaks create channels,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the water does not surface to the first manhole it reaches, and consequently, <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>a leak may remain undetected for years. If the leak is small, it emits very little vibration and can escape detection by a sounding device. Mr. Papadopoulos testified, in part, that at the time of the rupture, the District had no written procedures for investigating leaks, and that knowledge of what to do was acquired through “on-the-job training.” He agreed that the policy of the District in 1992 was “to effectuate shut offs of any water mains which had the potential of developing into a major leak.” Moreover, he replied, “No” to the question: “Was it ... known by the investigative crew that the loss of soil or support around a leaking water main joint was a cause of concern?” When asked whether “any computation [was] made as to the number of gallons of water lost ... as a result of [the] break,” he estimated that “[f]or a period of six or seven hours when the leak was not under control [the District] lost about fifteen million gallons in water.” Neither Mr. Cochran, nor Mr. Papadopoulos was asked what the national standard of care was with respect to the operation and maintenance of a municipal water main system, and the handling of leaks in that system.</p>
