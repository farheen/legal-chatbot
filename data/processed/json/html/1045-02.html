First, in numerous personnel provisions, Congress has used the term “pay” in a narrow sense to connote “rates of pay” or “rates of basic pay.” <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. (1976) §§ 5305, 5307, 5308, 5363, 5504, 5505, 5546, 5561(6). Thus the term “pay,” on its face, does not include comparability procedures for potential annual pay adjustments. Second, while § l-162(3)’s list of benefits which must remain at least equal to those previously applicable federal benefits is not exhaustive, the structure of the entire provision indicates that statutory processes or mechanisms are not included. It is true that the second sentence of § 1-162(3) states that certain federal statutory processes — e.g., processes relating to appointments, promotions, and separations— were to remain in effect <em>until the D.C. Council adopted its own merit personnel system. </em>However, it is the fourth sentence of the provision that states which personnel benefits must remain at least equal to the previously applicable federal benefits <em>after the new local law goes into effect. </em>The examples of benefits listed in this sentence are all finite <em>entitlements </em>— e.g., pay, tenure and leave — and do not include any personnel processes or mechanisms. A comparison of the list of the types of personnel legislation contained in the second sentence of § 1-162(3) with the list of the types of benefits contained in the fourth sentence indicates that Congress recognized a dis<a id="p1053" href="#p1053" data-label="1053" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1053</a>tinction between statutory processes and concrete entitlements. If Congress had intended that the new local law must include certain statutory processes, it would have so stated by including them in the list of benefits that must remain at least equal after the new law takes effect. Since, under the CMPA, only concrete entitlements were required to remain at least equal to the previously applicable federal entitlements, the unions’ second argument is based on an incorrect predicate and, accordingly, must fail.</p>

It seems highly unlikely that Congress intended that all local personnel processes had to mirror in every respect their federal counterparts. This, in the Court’s view, would be inconsistent with the congressional intention that the District develop a merit personnel system independent of the federal system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">32</a>

An exchange of memoranda in connection with the motion of six DOES employees to intervene herein (denied by separate order of June 30, 1981) made it clear that counsel for defendant intervenors does not claim to represent those six or any other DOES employees. This Court is informed by papers filed in connection with the above motion to intervene that, in U.S. District Court Civil Action No. 80-3215, DOES employees seek alternatively to be restored to the U.S. Department of Labor, to be restored to the federal civil service system, or to have their federal civil service standing protected. This Court has not undertaken to analyze whether DOES employees are in a status different from other D.C. employees generally, or from other transferees from federal service, and does not rule here on the right of transferred DOES employees to the relief requested in the other pending action. The Court infers from the inclusion of arguments that relate to transferred federal employees a representation by counsel for defendant intervenors that one or more intervening defendants represent federal transferees (other than DOES employees) in collective bargaining and thus claim standing to advance arguments uniquely applicable to such employees.</p>
