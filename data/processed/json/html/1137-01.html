The portion of the money appropriated by Sweeny was used to refurbish his funeral home that had deteriorated due to his financial problems. In a criminal action pending against Sweeny for this incident, he pled guilty to one felony count of theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and two counts of criminal conspiracy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Sweeny also argues that the Board erroneously relied upon the standards and sanctions that have been imposed upon attorneys by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Despite this contention, and in light of the fact that Section 11 of the Law specifically vests the Board with the authority to revoke a license if the licensee has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Board did consider the sanctions imposed by the Supreme Court. Moreover, even if the Board did consider those sanctions, having found that the revocation was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion, we cannot overturn its determination.</p>

    <p id="b1198-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.16",1198,[1022,771,746,450]]]'>The Board made note and observed that Sweeny, by appointment and two successive elections, served as coroner in Lackawanna County until his resignation, following his pleading guilty to misappropriating funds, which arose out of his responsibilities as administrator of an estate. The Board further noted that Sweeny’s reputation in the community still remains high, notwithstanding his plea of guilty.</p>
    <p id="b1198-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.17",1198,[1021,1241,748,629]]]'>Discretion requires a proper allocation of penalties to the degree of infringement or violation of codes of conduct. The misappropriation of funds arose by Sweeny’s irresponsibility as an administrator of an estate and did not have anything to do with his performance as a licensed funeral director. The reputation of Sweeny remains high subsequent to his plea of guilty. I believe that this court must consider Sweeny’s conduct pursuant to his responsibilities as a funeral director in comparison with his misappropriation of funds unrelated to funeral director activities.</p>
