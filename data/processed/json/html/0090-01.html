Hatch appeals from an order entered in the Superior Court (Cumberland County, <em>Alexander, J.) </em>dismissing his action against defendant Maine Tank Co., Inc., and a judgment entered in the Superior Court (Brodrick, <em>J.) </em>following a jury verdict in favor of defendant Wayne Home Equipment Co., Inc. On appeal, Hatch contends that (1) his failure to comply with the court’s order directing him to respond to discovery requests by Maine Tank did not warrant dismissal of his claim against Maine Tank, (2) the trial court erred by refusing to give certain jury instructions and in making certain evidentiary rulings, and (3) the evidence did not support the jury’s verdict in favor of <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>Wayne Home.

    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[243,348,754,1022]]]'>In November of 1980, Hatch worked at a gas station in Gorham owned by the Lido Company. Prior to and during Hatch’s employment, Lido had experienced problems due to leaks in the underground gasoline storage tanks at the station. The tanks were manufactured by Maine Tank. Water flooded the basement regularly when it rained and, as a result, the gas also made its way into the basement causing a buildup of fumes. In the few years preceding Hatch’s employment at the station, the fire department had been summoned “several times” regarding the “gasoline problem.” Lido attempted to rectify the problem using an electric fan to expel the fumes from the basement and a sump pump to drain the water/gas mixture. This case originated from injuries sustained by Hatch in an explosion caused by an electrical spark from the sump pump, which ignited the gasoline fumes in the basement.</p>

Michaud was familiar with sump pumps and did not read the instructions that came with the pump before installing it in the basement of the station. At the time of the purchase, nothing included with the pump or written on the pump warned that it should not be used in or around gasoline. The pump was not an “explosion-proof’ pump in that it was not completely encased to prevent electricity from coming into contact with the surrounding air. At trial, David Dodge, Hatch’s safety expert, admitted that, although explosion-proof pumps are available, it is not feasible from a cost/benefit perspective to require all pumps manufactured to be explosion-proof.</p>

The water mixture in the basement was approximately two feet deep; Hatch was concerned and called the <em>fire </em>department. He then called the Lido home office and William Pescosolido, one of the Lido owners, came out to the station. The fire chief told Pesco-solido to fix the gasoline problem once and for all and suggested Lido do so by filling in the basement with dirt or gravel. The fire chief also told Hatch that the pump was a direct fire hazard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

John walked down into the basement and Hatch went to the fuse panel. An electrical arc generated from the pump ignited the fumes in the basement and caused an explosion.

Because Hatch failed to respond to either the request for production or the interrogatories, Maine Tank filed a motion to compel discovery and for sanctions on October 29, 1987. The court granted the motion on November 9, 1987, and ordered that “[Hatch] shall respond to [Maine Tankj’s interrogatories [and] request for production of documents in full within 15 days <em>or the action shall be dismissed.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>

He contends, however, that the instruction should not have been given in this case or, in the alternative, that he was at least entitled to an additional instruction that a manufacturer has a duty to warn of even obvious dangers or hazards if it is “foreseeable that users of the product will proceed to encounter that hazard out of necessity, lack of a safe apparent alternative, or through momentary inadvertence.” <em>Marois v.

Because Hatch acknowledged his full awareness of the danger of using the sump pump in the manner prescribed by his employer, it was not error for the court to instruct the jury that there was no duty to warn of an obvious and apparent danger.
