The State thereupon requested the court to declare that the appointment and discharge of the Director of the Bureau of Veterans Services were controlled by public law. After a hearing and submission of briefs, the Superior Court vacated the award on September 5, 1980. The court concluded that the dispute was not arbitrable under the supervisory unit agreement executed between the State and the Association because (1) the parties to the agreement did not intend to submit such disputes to an arbitrator and (2) “[e]ven if the parties had so intended, their agreement would be void as against public policy and the language of 37-A M.R.S.A § 1(4) and 5 M.R.S.A. § 711(2) and 26 M.R.S.A. § 979-D(l)(E).” The court also concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in finding the dispute arbitrable and in reaching the merits of the dispute.</p>

The Act thus explicitly limits collective bargaining as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1283.5",1283,[245,1326,711,226]]]'>All matters relating to the relationship between the employer and employees shall be the subject of collective bargaining <em>except those matters which are prescribed or controlled by public law.</em>

The Director of the Bureau of Veterans Services is a position created by statute to manage the Bureau of Veterans Services, a Bureau within the Department of Defense and Veterans Services. 37-A M.R.S.A. § 1, § 11 (1978). The Department is supervised by an Adjutant General or Commissioner who is appointed and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. The Adjutant General is statutorily authorized to appoint the Director of the Bureau of Veterans Services, who, in turn, serves “at the pleasure of the Adjutant General.” <em>Id. </em>§ 1(4). The Director may employ “necessary assistance to carry out” the Bureau’s functions. <em>Id. </em>§ 11. Also, he is authorized to adopt “reasonable rules and regulations.” <em>Id. </em>§ 12, § 20.</p>
    <p id="b1283-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1283.13",1283,[1004,461,746,730]]]'>Under the Maine Personnel Law, state employees are divided into two categories, classified and unclassified. Employees in the classified division are hired on the basis of merit and must generally avoid political activity. 5 M.R.S.A. §§ 671-73, 676-77, § 679-A. In contrast, the unclassified service includes elected officials, certain other state employees, and so-called major policy-influencing positions. The position Wash-burn held is expressly designated a major policy-influencing position by statute. <em>Id. </em>§ 711(2)(A)(14)(c). Major policy-influencing personnel are <em>not </em>afforded protections against arbitrary employer discipline under the Maine Personnel Law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Under 37-A M.R.S.A. § 1 (1978), a line of authority sensitive to political pressures experienced at the highest levels of state government is established. The Director’s superior, the Adjutant General, serves at the pleasure of the Governor. The Adjutant General has “the power to appoint and remove” the Director of the Bureau. 5 M.R.S.A. § 711(2)(B) (1979). Just as the Adjutant General serves at the pleasure of the Governor, “the director serve[s] at the pleasure of the Adjutant General.” 37-A M.R.S.A. § 1(4) (1978).</p>

Thus, the authority of the Adjutant General, and thence, the Governor to discharge a state employee serving as Director for reasons other than just cause is clearly conferred by statute. That the Legislature intended the Adjutant General to have this prerogative is further supported by the express exemption of employees in the position of the Director from the statutory protections barring arbitrary discharge for disciplinary reasons. <em>See </em>footnote 6 <em>supra.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b1284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1284.4",1284,[215,974,753,1095]]]'>Requiring that a decision to terminate the employment of the Director be for just cause, as the Association’s contract with the State purports to require here, clearly conflicts with the authority of the Adjutant General conferred by statute. The political philosophy of a Director may well influence the way in which a particular director administers a Bureau. In the context of policy formulation and implementation, the concept of just cause is wholly inappropriate as a prerequisite to terminating the employment of a state employee who is serving at major policy-influencing levels of state government since the job performance of such an employee may be technically competent, but politically unsatisfactory. The notion of a position being served “at the pleasure of” a state official directly accountable to the Governor thus preserves legitimate political interaction and accountability at the policy-influencing levels of the Department of Defense and Veterans Services.</p>
    <p id="b1284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1284.5",1284,[215,2099,748,456]],["BL_1284.6",1284,[1019,270,744,129]]]'>Washburn and the Association nevertheless argue that the contractual provision permitting discipline of an employee only for just cause and the arbitration of a grievance resting on such a provision do not conflict with the statutes governing the position of Director of the Bureau of Veterans Services. The fact that the Director serves at the pleasure of the Adjutant General does not mean, they argue, that the State may not voluntarily agree in the course of collective bargaining to place restrictions on the exercise of the prerogative.</p>
    <p id="b1284-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1284.8",1284,[1014,421,747,1003]]]'>We do not find this argument persuasive for two reasons. First, the statute providing that the Director serve at the pleasure of the Adjutant General accentuates by its language the Legislature’s interest in requiring the Director to serve pursuant to that condition. The statute ordains that the Director <em>“shall </em>serve at the pleasure of the Adjutant General.” 37-A M.R.S.A. § 1(4). As we have suggested above, this mandate is not without a rational basis. Protracted proceedings for the purpose of adjudicating the rectitude of dismissing the Director risks seriously impeding the effective implementation of political policy at the policy-influencing levels of government. It is no accident that the Maine Personnel Law exempts state employees serving in positions at those levels of government from the protections afforded other state employees from arbitrary state disciplinary procedures. <em>See </em>5 M.R.S.A. § 678.</p>
    <p id="b1284-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1284.9",1284,[1012,1447,746,588]]]'>Second, acceptance of this argument would lead to unacceptable consequences. Illustratively, if the Governor or Adjutant General voluntarily determined as a matter of policy that the prerogative to dismiss the Director should be conceded during collective bargaining, a newly-elected Governor might be prevented from appointing a new Director whose views and talents were more attractive to him because a collective bargaining agreement, negotiated and approved during the prior Governor’s term, was still binding on the State.</p>
