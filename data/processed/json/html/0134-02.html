O’Brien,,Jr. The Notice sets forth charges that the respondent violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct: Canons 1, 2, 3(B)(4), 3(B)(5)(i), 3(B)(5)(H), 3(B)(5)(iii), 3(B)(6), 3(B)(8), 3(B)(8)(e), 3(B)(8)(f) and 3(E)(1)(a).

As a result, the public hearing was waived by the Supreme Court pursuant to the provisions of Rule 20 of the Rules of the Commission. The respondent, however, requested the opportunity to appear before the Commission to give testimony in mitigation of these violations. At a hearing before the Commission, the respondent appeared, represented by counsel, and gave testimony. He also presented approximately 40 affidavits from judges, lawyers and other persons that attested to his diligent and effective service as General Master under the often trying circumstances in the Family Court, underscored his achievements in enforcing child support orders, and provided further information about the specific complaints.</p>

    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[211,1319,756,1072]]]'>John J. O’Brien, Jr. was appointed Special Master of the Family Court in 1974. His principal responsibility was to preside over the “reciprocal calendar” which is devoted to the enforcement of child support orders against delinquent parents. His efforts in collecting delinquent payments were very successful, and he received national recognition for his work. The respondent described his judicial style as “assertive” and maintained that this style was required to be effective on that calendar.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In 1987 he was appointed to the position of General Master that was created by R.I.Gen.Laws § 8-10-3.2 and thus became subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission. Thereafter, his responsibilities expanded, and he presided over a number of calendars in the Family Court and performed duties much the same as a judge of that court. The several complaints that triggered this proceeding relate to his conduct as to litigants and others who appeared before him between 1992 and 1994.</p>

Adams (Sr.) for twenty years, during a hearing on whether Adams should be released on bail violated Canons 1, 3(B)(4), and 3(E)(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>
