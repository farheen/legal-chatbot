At the time of the filing of this Morgan reissue application the Conradson patent was already involved in an interference proceeding with a pending application of Conradson’s coappellees, Alden M. Drake and Boy D. Hubbell, serial No. 528118, filed January 9, 1922.

No testimony was taken in the case, and on January 29, 1927, the examiner of interferences rendered his final decision awarding priority of invention to Myles Morgan, the senior party, and appellant herein. The junior parties thereupon appealed to the Board of Appeals, who, on December 12, 1927, rendered a decision reversing the examiner of interferences and denying priority of invention to Morgan.

It is essential that we pass upon this in determining the issue of priority. If Morgan had no right to make the claims in his reissue application, because their features were not properly disclosed, as required in the administration of the patent laws, in the patent upon which the reissue was filed, then he can not be given priority. Obviously, it is not necessary in interference cases to consider dates of conception and reduction to practice until it has been definitely determined that the thing conceived and reduced to practice is so similar in structure to the thing which it is sought to have declared an interference as that both conceptions read úpon the count.</p>

The count then recites a piston and cylinder unit for moving the carriage. This feature is shown in Figure 1. ■ The control valve next included in count 1 is designated 8 connected to a shaft 28-on the outer end of which is a lever 34 capable of movement in various directions and releasably interlocked with another lever 40- extending into the path of travel of the stops 46, 47, 48. During the normal operation of the device alternate engagement of the upper end of lever 40 by stops 46 and 47 on the carriage will as stated in the count automatically reverse the valve and effect reciprocation of the carriage. However, if it is desired to allow travel of the carriagfe to the so-called idle position where it may be stopped, lever 34 is disengaged from lever 40 manually and the carriage allowed to advance so as to bring the latter lever into the field of stop 48 with consequent actuation of valve lever 34 by contact therewith of pin 50 carried by lever 40. The actuation of lever 34 in the manner indicated moves valve 8 into a neutral or inactive position and thereby stops reciprocation of the carriage.</blockquote>

Claims 1 and 2 of the patent are limited solely to the combination just referred to. They do not include either directly or by implication the stopping of the table. Claim 3 is generally the same as claims 1 and 2 in so far as the specific limitations to cover or guard construction are concerned. Claim 3 in addition to the limitations as to cover or guard construction specifies a limiting stop for determining the retracted position of the reciprocating tables. As above noted, there is in claim 3 no limitation to stopping the table and the stop broadly included might be a reversing stop for effecting reciprocation of the table. The decision of the law examiner states on page 6 thereof that if the validity of the Morgan reissue application were dependent on claiming more than is described and claimed in the original patent the earlier leading cases relating to the issues would justify a holding that such reissue as is presented here, if granted, would be invalid. But the law examiner suggests that later decisions of the courts are more liberal and are controlling here. The law examiner cites in support of this conclusion the cases of <em>In re Briede, </em>1906 C. D., 677 and <em>In re Heroult, </em>1907 C. D., 521. It is sufficient to note here that in both the cited cases there was a clear disclosure of the subject matter claimed and in one of them it was held that the invention claimed in the reissue was in substance and effect the same invention as that claimed in the original patent. In the original Morgan patent the essential and vital ■element of all the claims was the cover or door. In the claims of the Morgan reissue application with which we are concerned there is no hint of this vital and essential element but a distinctly different combination is claimed. Touching the disclosure of the original Morgan patent aside from the claim we fail to find any basis for the claims of the reissue application involved in interference. * * * . The only construction shown and described in the original Morgan patent which remotely relates to the invention involved in interference, under the interpretation placed, on the patent by counsel for Morgan, is the stop 73 mounted on the carriage and described in line 99 and following of page 1 of the specification of the original Morgan patent. * * * It will be noted that the matter just quoted does not state that the contact of the stop 73 with the arm 74 stops the movement of the worktable. Not only is this true but there is no explanation of the manner in which the parts function. * * * Morgan realized when he filed the reissue application that there was no sufficient basis in the original patent for the claims copied from the Conradson patent. Three sheets of drawings were added to the single sheet constituting the illustration of the original patent and the specification of the reissue was correspondingly amplified. The added drawings correspond to certain of the drawings of the Ralph L. Morgan application. * * * The amplification of the specification of the original Morgan patent included a detailed description of the mechanism for controlling the reciprocation of the worktable and also specific statements that contact of stop 73 with arm 74 on lever W stops the movement of the worktable. * * * The drawings of the reissue application •do not disclose except by implication the relation of the stop 73 to the steps which control the ordinary reciprocation of the worktable. * * * We note a distinction between a mere disclosure of an invention and an indication that the invention was intended to be protected by the patent. Even if it be admitted that the invention of the claims under consideration can be spelled out of the specification and drawing of the original patent, and we think it can not, that is <a id="p736" href="#p736" data-label="736" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*736</a>not the same tiling as an indication that the patent sought to protect the invention in question. * * * It is our view that linesi 11 to 25, page 2, of the original Morgan patent describe automatic reversal of the carriage. No good' reason is seen why stop 73 will function differently from stop 76. * *' * In any event there is too much uncertainty about the operation of the stop 73 of the Morgan reissue application to justify an award of priority in favor of Morgan. Where a party seeks through a reissue application to secure an award of priority over a regularly issued patent or an application clearly disclosing the subject matter in controversy there should be no uncertainty as to the nature of the disclosure of the reissue application. In our judgment certainty of disclosure'of the subject matter in issue is not present in the Morgan application.</blockquote>
