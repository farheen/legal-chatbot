Nevertheless, simply because committees fall within the definition of “agency” does not mean that they may be substituted for a particular body (a board or council) accorded a specific responsibility (entertaining public commentary) by the Legislature under the Sunshine Act.

As Appellants observe, however, Section 710.1(a) allows for adjustments to the timing of public commentary in light of prevailing time constraints; whereas, Section 710.1(d) grandfathers the practice of entertaining advance public commentary via special meeting.

The Act defines “agency” to include the “body, and all committees thereof authorized by the body to take official action or render advice on matters of agency business, of all the following: ... any board, council, authority or commission of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 703 (emphasis added). I am persuaded by Council’s reading this definition together with the definitions of “meeting” and “special meeting” — as well as the obvious grandfathering clause in Section 710.1(d) — to allow Council to receive public comment at special meetings of its committees, without the requirement that a quorum of Council members be present. Instead, under this more generous reading, only a quorum of the committee is required, and Council’s practice does not violate the Act. As a matter of course, then, I respectfully cannot agree with the Majority’s position that this latter interpretation represents improper “bootstrapping.” Maj. Op. at 314-15.</p>

The practice serves the goals of the Act by providing an open forum for meaningful and orderly public participation in the legislative process while promoting the efficient operation of the legislative body of the Commonwealth’s largest city.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> As a practical matter, and as Council argues, its committee procedure may well be superior to a public comment period that might be offered at its regular meetings, where final votes would be taken. In this case, and consistently with the practice in effect in Philadelphia for over half a century, appellants were allowed to provide input to the committee in advance of the regular Council meeting at which the bill was passed, so it appears they actually had a more realistic opportunity to participate in shaping the legislation, rather than speaking at the very meeting where the vote was taken. In my judgment, Council’s committee practice satisfies the Act’s general requirement that the council of a political subdivision must provide a reasonable opportunity for public <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>comment regarding matters under consideration. <em>See </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 710.1(a). Council’s practice furthers the Commonwealth’s stated policy of public access, 65 Pa.C.S. § 702, and constitutes a permissible adoption of rules “necessary for the conduct of its meetings and the maintenance of order.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 710.</p>
