Because the court’s findings are unclear as to whether it was awarding reimbursement support or general support, we vacate the portion of the judgment relating to spousal support and remand to the District Court for it to reconsider its award.</p>
    <p id="b932-16" data-blocks='[["BL_932.15",932,[1201,668,358,31]]]'>I. BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b932-17" data-blocks='[["BL_932.16",932,[1004,744,750,611]]]'>[¶ 2] Jonathan and Jennifer had been married for approximately nine years. Jonathan, age thirty, graduated from the University of New England Medical School in 2002 and completed his residency in the fall of 2004. At the divorce hearing, Jonathan acknowledged that he had the ability to earn between $75,000 and $100,000 as a general practitioner. Jonathan, however, wishes to pursue a fellowship opportunity in medical research where he will earn ábout $40,000 annually.</p>
    <p id="b932-18" data-blocks='[["BL_932.17",932,[999,1388,755,812]]]'>[¶ 3] Jennifer, age thirty-three, is a social worker and earns about $38,000 a year. The court found that she was at or near her full economic potential. She willingly relocated to Maine, away from family and friends, to support her husband while he obtained a medical degree. While he was in medical school, she acquired a master’s degree in social work at the University of New England at a cost in excess of $70,000. The court found that she would not have incurred such a large education debt but for the assurance from her husband that he, upon becoming a physician, would have the necessary income to pay her educational debts.</p>
    <p id="b932-19" data-blocks='[["BL_932.18",932,[1000,2241,751,404]],["BL_933.1",933,[167,252,755,411]]]'>[¶ 4] The court found that a denial of spousal support would lead to an unjust and inequitable result, and that Jennifer had rebutted the presumption against an award of spousal support in the eight-year, eleven-month marriage. The court therefore ordered Jonathan to make reimbursement payments as follows: $15,000 on or <a id="p893" href="#p893" data-label="893" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*893</a>before June 1, 2005; $15,000 on or before June 1, 2006; and $20,000 on or before June 1, 2007. Jonathan filed a motion for reconsideration and for further findings of fact regarding his future earnings and level of employability, which the court denied. Jonathan now appeals from the District Court’s spousal support award.</p>
