Benham contends that the court erred when it determined that a landlord and tenant relationship existed in regard to the rented cottage where Benham was injured, and that because of this relationship, defendants had no duty to prevent her injury. Because we conclude that the rental of the cottage created a license to use the premises, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b520-17" data-blocks='[["BL_520.18",520,[1205,1743,359,32]]]'>I. BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b520-18" data-blocks='[["BL_520.19",520,[1008,1813,753,603]]]'>[¶ 2] The following facts are undisputed. In July 1999, Kathleen Benham of Denver, Colorado, was visiting Maine with family members. Her sister, Colleen Blevins, had rented a cottage in Rangeley for two weeks between July 31, 1999, and August 14, 1999. The cottage was owned by Aline and Rheal Caron, and the rental agreement was brokered by Morton &amp; Furbish, a real estate and rental agency. The Car-on cottage was also listed for sale with Morton &amp; Furbish.</p>
    <p id="b520-19" data-blocks='[["BL_520.20",520,[1007,2452,751,196]],["BL_521.1",521,[167,258,754,402]]]'>[¶ 3] The Carons had agreed with Morton &amp; Furbish to make their cottage available for rent so long as Morton &amp; Furbish would continue to show the Caron cottage <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>to potential buyers during any renters’ use of the cottage. The Carons and Morton &amp; Furbish also agreed that the renters would not have access to the cottage’s attic, which was used to store personal items. Morton &amp; Furbish, however, had permission to unlock the attic trapdoor to show the attic to potential buyers of the cottage.</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[169,700,752,507]]]'>[¶4] Blevins made the rental arrangements without having previously been inside the Caron cottage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Benham and Blevins understood the rental was for the family to use exclusively for two weeks. The vacationing family members also understood that no one was going to come in and clean the cottage premises on a daily basis or do any structural work on the cottage during their rental.</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.7",521,[168,1246,754,767]]]'>[¶ 5] Morton &amp; Furbish supplied the linens for the users of the cottage; arranged for trash removal (and snow removal for winter occupants); supplied toiletries and general household supplies; and was responsible for cleaning the cottage after checkout. Morton &amp; Furbish had a policy that users of vacation rentals were not to use the phones to call long-distance unless using a credit card to pay for the call. Morton &amp; Furbish collected sales tax from Blevins at a rate of 7% for her use of the Caron cottage. <em>See </em>36 M.R.S. §§ 1752(12), 1811 (2006). Morton &amp; Furbish reserved the right to refuse service to anyone.</p>

When Benham and her family arrived at the cottage, the attic trapdoor at the top of the attic stairs was open and not padlocked. The family had not been told by Morton &amp; Furbish that the attic area of the cottage was unavailable for their use.</p>
    <p id="b521-10" data-blocks='[["BL_521.10",521,[968,370,754,446]]]'>[¶ 7] Within minutes of her arrival, Ben-ham went partway up the stairs leading to the attic to explore the space, and then turned around to descend. On her way down, Benham made a misstep, lost her balance, and fell off of the staircase and onto the floor. The injuries that she sustained in that fall are the subject of this action.</p>
    <p id="b521-11" data-blocks='[["BL_521.11",521,[969,848,754,599]]]'>[¶ 8] When the Carons first purchased the cottage, a pull-down ladder had provided access to the attic. At some point before 1999, the pull-down ladder broke, and Rheal Caron replaced the ladder with stairs that he designed and built himself. The stairs had no guard or handrails, were twenty-four inches in width, and had a nine-inch rise. The Carons used the attic to store beds and cots, linens, personal clothes, life jackets, and other personal items.</p>
    <p id="b521-12" data-blocks='[["BL_521.12",521,[967,1479,756,922]]]'>[¶ 9] In 2005, Benham filed a complaint in the Superior Court against Morton &amp; Furbish and the Carons alleging that they had negligently designed and permitted the dangerous condition of the cottage’s attic stairs to exist on the premises, as well as breach of express and implied warranties that the premises would be fit for human habitation and occupancy and would be fit for the purpose of a vacation rental property. Morton &amp; Furbish filed a motion for a summary judgment on all counts of Benham’s complaint, contending that no duty was owed to Benham to prevent her injuries and that there was no evidence of a breach of express or implied warranty. The Carons also filed a motion for a summary judgment against Benham.</p>
    <p id="b522-3" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[194,251,759,870]]]'>
      <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>[¶ 10] The Superior Court granted the summary judgment motions of Morton &amp; Furbish and the Carons on all counts. The court reasoned that no duty was owed to Benham because of the rule that “a landlord is not liable for injuries caused by defective conditions in areas that are within the exclusive possession and control of the lessee.” The court also found that no duty was owed to a tenant or guest of a tenant with regard to the design of the stairs. The court concluded that summary judgment was warranted as to the warranty claim because there was no evidence of an express warranty, and consequential damages are precluded for a breach of warranty of habitability.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[195,1147,753,250]]]'>[¶ 11] Benham filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 59(e), which the court denied without explanation. Benham filed this appeal of the summary judgment on the negligence claims.</p>

We address in turn: (A) the standard of review for summary judgment on the duty of care to an occupant; (B) how the duty of care is affected by the distinction between a tenancy and a license; and (C) whether the rental of the Caron cottage created a lease to the premises or a license to use the premises.</p>

The existence of a duty of care in the present case depends on whether the two-week vacation rental of the Caron cottage created a lease to the premises, or alternatively, a license to use the premises. Whether the arrangement created a lease or a license is also a question of law. <em>See Levesque v.

Benham was the guest of Blevins, and a duty of reasonable care was owed to Benham. <em>See Pelletier, </em><a href="/a2d/662/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="662 A.2d 220" data-case-ids="7861708" data-case-paths="/a2d/662/0220-01">662 A.2d at 221-22</a>. Because we conclude that there was a duty of reasonable care, we do not address whether there is a dispute of a material fact about the existence of exclusive possession and control of the premises. Additionally, because the issue was not reached by the Superior Court, we do not address the Carons’ contention that Morton &amp; Furbish acted outside the scope of the agency relationship.</p>

Blevins originally contracted with Morton &amp; Furbish to rent a different cottage in Range-ley. However, after Morton &amp; Furbish realized that they had inadvertently rented the same cottage to another individual for the same period, Morton &amp; Furbish made a unilateral decision to substitute either the Caron cottage or another identified cottage. Blevins chose the Caron cottage.</p>

At oral argument, the parties also addressed several public policy concerns including whether, if the vacationing family overstayed the rental period, the Carons and Morton &amp; Furbish could resort to self-help or would instead have to go through the process of forcible entry and detainer. <em>See Sawyer v. Congress Square Hotel Co., </em><a href="/me/157/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="157 Me. 111" data-case-ids="921838" data-case-paths="/me/157/0111-01">157 Me. 111</a>, 115, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20645" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="170 A.2d 645">170 A.2d 645</a>, 647 (1961) (holding that guest of hotel not entitled to notice of eviction); 14 M.R.S. §§ 6001-6016 (2006). The parties also discussed the availability of insurance for short-term occupancies. We base our conclusion on the undisputed facts of this rental agreement, and do not reach these public policy arguments.</p>
