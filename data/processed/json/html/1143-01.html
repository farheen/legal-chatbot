The order provided that the CAT Fund would be subject to a fíne of $1.00 per day for each day that a designated representative did not attend the trial of the malpractice action, commencing on March 15, 1999. The fine was to be made payable to the Lackawanna County Law Library. The order further stayed imposition of any fine pending appeal, while specifying that the other proceedings in the malpractice action were not stayed. The trial court also entered a separate order certifying that the order making the rule absolute involved a controlling question of law as to which there was substantial ground for difference of opinion and that immediate appeal could materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter. 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The court noted that Lackawanna County R.C.P. No. 212 requires that the attorneys for each party appear at the pre-trial conference, and that, if the attorney does not have complete settlement authority, the party or a person with full settlement authority must accompany the attorney to the pre-trial conference or be available by telephone during the conference.

The CAT Fund asserts that it has been granted the power to evaluate a case and adjust a medical malpractice claim by the General Assembly, and that if the authority of the trial court is extended so that the CAT Fund can be punished for discharging its executive function, this would violate the separation of powers of the government branches.</p>

Further, they contend that the separation of powers doctrine was not violated by the trial court’s attachment order, which was designed to effectuate a reasonable settlement, or by sanctioning the CAT Fund for a violation of the order.</p>

Because of the number and complexity of trials in which the CAT Fund is interested as a consequence of its statutory role as an excess insurance provider in the medical malpractice arena, it is my belief that our approval of the attachment practice would impose an undue and unworkable burden upon the administrative scheme. However, rather than concluding that the common pleas court lacked the power to enter its attachment order, I would simply disapprove subsequent attachments pursuant to an exercise of this Court’s supervisory powers. <em>See </em>Pa.

Although in its appellate brief the CAT Fund challenged, in summary fashion, the trial court’s power to find it in contempt of an order which exceeded the trial court’s authority, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant at 24 n. 9, at oral argument, counsel for the CAT Fund candidly and commendably acknowledged that the CAT Fund ignored the trial court’s order; the proper course would have been to seek a stay and challenge the order through the courts; and, accordingly, the CAT Fund was not pressing its opposition to the sanction imposed. Thus, the CAT Fund appropriately acceded to the trial court’s reasonable and largely symbolic one-dollar per day fine, to be paid to the Lackawanna County Law Library, thereby clearing technical questions from the discussion in an effort to focus the Court on its core concern. This strategy not only sharpened the argument, but also demonstrated fitting deference to the courts’ interests, since, absent extraordinary circumstances, allowing litigants to simply ignore judicial mandates would seriously impede the ability of a court to manage the litigation before it and, more generally, the orderly administration of justice.</p>
