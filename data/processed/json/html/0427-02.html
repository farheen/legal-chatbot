It was clear that by reason of the Delaware Guest Statute (21 Del.C., § 6101) the plaintiffs could not have recovered damages from the driver of the car in which they were riding. <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>The Superior Court held that the Tort-feasor Contribution Statute had no application unless there was a “common liability” to the plaintiffs between the defendant and the proposed contributor.

This does not follow, however, because the employer’s right of recovery over against the employee is based, not upon the original claim based upon the employee’s negligence, but upon the failure of the employee to live up to his independent duty of care owed for the protection of the employer’s interest. 3 Prosser on Torts, § 116, p. 890; 2 Restatement of Agency 2nd, § 401.</p>

Those jurisdictions which allow recovery by a wife in situations such as this are illustrated by the leading case of Schubert v.

The husband’s immunity from suit, however, is not carried forward to his employer. This results from the fact that injury to another has been caused by the negligence of the employee in the course of his employment. The holding rests squarely upon the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>The Schubert case, therefore, places the liability of the employer upon the concept of the culpability of the employee and not upon his personal liability. The employer is held liable, not because his employee is also liable, but because in the course of his employment, <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>presumably in his employer’s interest, the employee, by his tortious conduct has caused injury to another.

    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[139,519,754,709]]]'>The rationale of the Riegger case, however, is that the immunity of the husband from suit brought by his wife is extended to the husband’s employer in a suit brought against him by his employee’s wife. Basically, the difference in this view from that expressed in the Schubert case is that the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>has as its true basis the question of liability rather than culpability of the employee for his tortious act. In other words, if the employee may be held liable, the employer is liable and, conversely, if the employee may not be held liable, the employer may not be held liable.</p>

Plotkin, supra, granted the husband immunity from suit by his wife because at common law they were held to be one person and, thus presumably, could not commit a tort against each other. We do not so read the Plotkin case. That question was not before the court. The decision was not that no cause of action could be created as between husband and wife because of their fictional common law unity, but rather was that the right to sue in enforcement of a claim for damages would be denied because “the right to sue each other strikes at the very heart of domestic relations.” The decision would seem to be the grant of immunity as a defense to an action which otherwise could have been maintained. It was not, we think, a holding that the wife could not sue because she had no cause of action as the defendant contends.</p>

In that case, the question was whether or not a parent could be held liable as a third party defendant under 21 Del.C. §§ 6105(a) and 6106, for the simple negligence of a minor who had been permitted to drive the parent’s automobile, when at the same time the minor, by reason of the Delaware Guest Statute, could be held liable only for his willful or wanton disregard of the rights of others. This court construed 21 Del.C., §§ 6105(a) and 6106 as in effect giving legislative approval to some aspects of the “Family Use Doctrine” which, read together with the Guest Statute, imposed liability upon the parent to the extent, and only to the extent, that the minor was liable. Thus, the defense of the Guest Statute was available as a defense in an action seeking to hold the parent liable for the tort of a minor. The parent’s liability was not held to rest upon the doctrine of <em>respondeat </em>superior, but squarely upon the statute. The ease is not in point.</p>

The case is distinguishable on the same ground as the McHugh case.</p>

Thus, it is argued, this plaintiff never had a cause of action since such could not be created by her husband’s act.
