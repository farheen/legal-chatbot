Parsons, to three (3) months of electronic monitoring under the supervision of the Berks County Probation Office, followed by a five-year term of probation, in violation of the parties’ plea agreement that called for a greater sentence. After careful review of the certified record as well as the relevant, settled law pertaining to plea agreements, we hold the court erred when it allowed Appellee to lodge an untimely challenge to the sentencing term of the plea agreement, and when the court set aside the sentencing term, without the Commonwealth’s consent, despite the clarity of the plea agreement both as to the charges and the specific sentence, which the court had previously accepted. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for imposition of the sentence contained in the parties’ plea bargain.</p>

      <em>(Id. </em>at 6-8). Despite the clarity of the plea agreement both as to the charges and the specific sentence, and notwithstanding Ap-pellee’s acknowledgement of the expected sentence at the plea hearing, the court allowed Appellee to lodge an untimely challenge to the sentencing term of the plea agreement and then set that term aside, while retaining only the charging terms. The court simply refused to impose the agreed-upon fixed sentence of six (6) to twenty-three (23) months on the statutory sexual assault followed by five (5) years of probation on the corruption of minors offense. Instead, the court placed Appellee on electronic monitoring for three (3) months under the supervision of the Berks County Probation Office, for the statutory sexual assault count. The Commonwealth immediately objected, observing that the court’s sentence constituted a rejection of the plea agreement. Consequently, the Commonwealth asked the court to set the matter for trial and transfer it to the trial list. At this point, the court told the prosecutor to file a motion with case law supporting the Commonwealth’s right to withdraw the plea agreement.

    <p id="b1294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1294.5",1294,[191,471,753,1641]]]'>¶ 13 The Commonwealth argues the parties reached an interdependent agreement both as to charges and sentence in this case. When the court accepted the plea agreement, it was then bound by the agreed-upon sentence contained in the agreement. The Commonwealth claims the court should have allowed the Commonwealth to exercise its right to withdraw the plea agreement, when the court later rejected the negotiated sentence and refused to impose it. Once the court accepted the negotiated plea to the reduced charges, the court was then obligated to impose the agreed-upon sentence and no longer had the authority to impose a substantially lower sentence. In essence, the court unilaterally modified a non-sev-erable term of the parties’ agreement. The Commonwealth contends that if the court were dissatisfied with the sentencing aspect of the agreement, then the proper recourse would have been to reject the plea agreement and return the parties to parity. Because the court accepted the plea but later altered the negotiated sentence provision of the plea agreement without the Commonwealth’s consent, the Commonwealth concludes the judgment of sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for imposition of the sentence pursuant to the plea bargain.</p>

In the corresponding segment of its brief, the Commonwealth argues the panel misapprehended the Commonwealth’s position as a challenge to the sentence imposed, rather than to the court’s failure to accept or reject the entire plea bargain. As between the Commonwealth and Appellee, the expectations of the bargain were for specific charges and a specific sentence. All the terms of the agreement were placed on the record at the guilty plea hearing, and the court accepted Appellee’s plea. When Appellee’s counsel later challenged the agreed-upon sentence at sentencing, the court decided to reject the sentencing provision of the parties’ agreement. In short, the court altered the plea agreement without the Commonwealth’s approval; and, as soon as the court rejected the sentencing term of the plea bargain, the court disavowed the plea bargain. The Commonwealth concludes it is not contesting the discretionary aspects of sentencing; the Commonwealth’s position is that the sentence imposed should be deemed void as it violates the parties’ plea bargain.

Absolutely nothing at the plea hearing even remotely suggested that the court or Appellee disagreed with the sentencing term of the plea bargain as presented.

Consequently, we agree with the Commonwealth that the issue before us does not involve a challenge to the discretionary aspects of sentencing. The individualized sentencing process in this Commonwealth does not prohibit or contravene the freedom of the Commonwealth and the defendant to waive certain rights and enter into a plea bargain that includes a specified sentence.</p>

In its opinion, the trial court expressly refers to this as a “defense” or justification for the compromised sentence, stating: “[Appellee] lacked capacity to understand the seriousness of the consensual sexual behavior.” (Trial Court Opinion, dated May 16, 2006, at 6). We respectfully reject this stance. The offenses to which Appellant pled guilty were statutory offenses; under Pennsylvania law, the victim in this case had no capacity to “consent.” Therefore, the court erred when it justified the reduced sentence on the basis that the sexual behavior was “consensual.” The Commonwealth’s plea bargain with Appel-lee fully considered the relevant circumstances and mitigating factors unique to Appellee’s situation. Any further consideration given to the mutuality of the sexual activity was inappropriate.</p>

Such a holding here is inappropriate; despite the Majority’s insistence that “the parties’ plea bargain involved a specific sentence, not merely a ‘sentencing recommendation,’ ” Op. at 1270 (original emphasis), the record suggests an understanding by the court <em>and the Commonwealth </em>that the parties had merely reached an agreement for a reduction in charges with a sentence recommendation to be measured against standard sentencing factors — which the Commonwealth enumerated on the record. As described by the Commonwealth: “This is a charge agreement as the Court can see from the Information <em>as well as the ■sentencing agreement if the Court should choose to accept it.” N.T., </em>Guilty Plea, 1/27/06, at 9.

Subject to that caveat, <em>which elicited no objection from the Commonwealth, </em>the court accepted Parsons’ plea. <em>Id. </em>at 12.

Op., at 1264. Unfortunately, the Majority fails to acknowledge the complete failure of the Commonwealth to oppose either request or assert that if, in fact, a binding agreement on the sentence existed, <em>a PSI report was completely unnecessary. </em>Moreover, the Commonwealth compounded the matter when, at the subsequent sentencing hearing, it detailed the appropriate ranges under the Sentencing Guidelines, the offense gravity score, and the defendant’s prior record score of zero. <a id="p1274" href="#p1274" data-label="1274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1274</a>N.T., Sentencing, 4/4/06, at 3.

I would ask the court to note that throughout, despite the long time which this case has been pending, the victim has not had to testify.

      <em>Id. </em>at 5. In my opinion, this excerpt leaves little room for debate. The prosecutor, in tone, tenor, and plain language recognized the non-binding nature of the sentence he was <em>recommending. </em>Thus, what the Commonwealth described as a “charging agreement” and “sentencing agreement” appears as an open plea with sentencing recommendation. The Commonwealth’s discussion of the PSI report, its detailed recitation of the Guidelines sentencing ranges, and related scores, and its request that the trial judge “accept and adopt the plea agreement” two months after the court had accepted Parson’s plea simply make no sense otherwise. Moreover, to the extent the Commonwealth was entitled to the benefit of any bargain, the prosecutor’s own language establishes that it received that benefit in having avoided a trial and spared the victim the need to appear in court. Although the Commonwealth was quick to adjust its position when the trial judge elected not to impose jail time, <em>see id. </em>at 11, the fact remains that the Commonwealth’s own presentation established a framework for the exercise of judicial discretion to accept or reject a <em>recommended </em>sentence. On this point our Supreme Court has provided precise direction which, given the Majority’s determination to the contrary, bears repetition here:</p>

Such a resolution is depen-dant, of course, upon an interpretation of the record that I do not accept. To the extent that the Majority’s decision will impose it, however, I find another alternative equally viable. The defendant may file a post sentence motion to withdraw guilty plea on the basis of the manifest injustice which, in my view is arguably present.

Although the judge was not bound to accept the defendant’s plea, if he accepted it in the presence of a fully negotiated plea agreement, he was not then able to disavow the sentence and impose another. Given this “advice,” I find it unsurprising that the defendant would appear in court for sentencing urging imposition of a lighter sentence. In its lack of complete clarity, the colloquy created a “perfect storm” of circumstances that effectively allowed the defendant to tender a plea of guilty and then appeal to the trial judge to exercise leniency. In my view, the fact that both the defendant and the trial court then acted accordingly, exercising prerogatives the Majority finds they did not have, raises a substantial question of the extent to which the defendant, having ostensibly relied on an incorrect recitation by the court, can be said to have acted in a fully voluntary fashion. Because I believe that this issue remains unresolved on the record before us, I would conclude that imposition of the “agreed” sentence is no more viable than the option of post sentence plea withdraw. I would conclude accordingly that should the Majority persist in vacating the judgment of sentence imposed, it must remand subject to the defendant’s right to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial.</p>
