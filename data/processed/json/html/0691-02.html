Kuhn’s co-defendant, appellant <a id="p694" href="#p694" data-label="694" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*694</a>Darnell Smith, was convicted of one count of armed robbery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In their direct appeals, each appellant contends that the trial court should have severed their trials or granted them separate new trials because their defenses were irreconcilable. The direct appeals have been consolidated with two collateral appeals: (1) that of Smith from the denial of his motion to set aside his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) that of Kuhn from the denial of his post-trial motion to unseal the transcript of an <em>ex parte </em>bench conference in which his co-defendant Smith discussed his unhappiness with his trial counsel’s direction of his defense.</p>
    <p id="b724-4" data-blocks='[["BL_724.4",724,[177,1129,758,767]]]'>The foremost issue presented in these consolidated appeals is whether Smith’s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he chose, over Smith’s objection, to argue a theory of defense different from that to which Smith testified. In agreement with the trial court, we conclude that Smith’s counsel was not ineffective, for after he consulted with his client, the choice of defense strategy was committed to counsel’s professional judgment even if Smith did not consent to it, and the strategy he pursued in his closing argument was an objectively reasonable and permissible one.</p>

The robbery occurred while Knott had left Blaize and Philbert alone momentarily and gone across the street in order to speak with one of her neighbors. Appellant Kuhn appeared, grabbed Blaize from behind, held a gun to his temple, and pulled him back into an alley. After obtaining $150 in cash from Blaize’s wallet, Kuhn ordered Philbert to hand over her money, too. At this point, Blaize and Philbert testified, appellant Smith ran up to Philbert and seconded Kuhn’s demand for her money. Philbert also relinquished $150 to the robbers.</p>
    <p id="b724-10" data-blocks='[["BL_724.11",724,[981,1327,754,811]]]'>Meanwhile, across the street, Knott became aware of her friends’ plight. Knott testified at trial that she saw Kuhn rob Blaize at gunpoint. It appeared to Knott that Kuhn was accompanied by a man she knew named Isaac Mitchell.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Knott also observed Smith, but in contrast to her friends’ account, she testified that Smith remained about fifteen feet away from Kuhn and did not approach Blaize or Phil-bert. “Shocked” by what was occurring, Knott started across the street, yelling that Blaize and Philbert were her friends. She caught up with them after the robbery as they were running away, and the trio called the police.</p>

Before long, they spotted Kuhn, Smith and Mitchell, who were standing together on the street. The three men <a id="p695" href="#p695" data-label="695" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*695</a>were caught and arrested after a brief chase. The police recovered a total of $236 from their possession and a small packet of marijuana from Smith. No gun was found.</p>
    <p id="b725-5" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[172,552,754,1111]]]'>Appellants presented a different version of events. They admitted encountering Blaize and Philbert, but as forecast in their attorneys’ opening statements, appellants denied that the encounter resulted in robbery. Rather, Smith and Kuhn each testified, they happened to be walking down the street (accompanied by Mitchell) when Blaize, whom they did not know, appeared and signaled to Kuhn that he wanted to buy some marijuana. Smith offered to sell Blaize a dime bag that he happened to have hidden in his sock, but Blaize wanted a full ounce. Kuhn said that he could obtain an ounce of marijuana from a dealer he knew, and Blaize allegedly gave Kuhn $120 to buy it and bring it back to him. Kuhn, Smith and Mitchell left to carry out this commercial errand. However, appellants testified, before they were able to find the dealer, they were stopped by the police.</p>
    <p id="b725-6" data-blocks='[["BL_725.5",725,[175,1687,753,606]]]'>Appellants’ theory apparently was that Blaize, Philbert and Knott, believing that appellants had absconded, concocted the story of a robbery in order to have them arrested so that Blaize could recover the money he naively had entrusted to Kuhn. In his closing argument, however, Smith’s counsel, Ronald Horton, did not argue this “drug deal gone bad” theory. Although Horton began by asking the jury to credit his client’s testimony, he chose not to dwell on the particulars of what Smith had said:</p>

I will not talk any more about his testimony, because the burden is on the government.

The documents contained information which in my opinion held the promise of a defense strategy that could be successful. The police statement of complainant Tansy Philbert indicated that the co-defendant alone completed the robbery of herself and the other complainant. The grand jury testimony of eyewitness Cynthia Knott could be reasonably construed as indicating that Mr. Smith did not participate in any robbery. Upon receiving that information I determined that the strategy most likely to result in a verdict beneficial to my client’s interests was to propound a theory of defense and strategy of cross-examination that attempted to raise a reasonable doubt as to my client’s involvement in any criminal activity and to distance my client from the conduct engaged in by the co-defendant.</blockquote>

To begin with, the court noted, while Horton primarily emphasized the weaknesses of the government’s proof and the exculpatory implications of Knott’s testimony rather than his client’s account, he did not disavow Smith’s testimony; to the contrary, he explicitly asked the jury to credit it. More importantly, the court stated, Horton was not obliged to advocate the theory of defense that Smith favored: “[b]y the time of closing, with all of the evidence in, it was counsel, not his client, who had the authority and responsibility for making the strategic decisions with respect to how to structure the closing argument.” Horton “had a choice. He could rely entirely on the ‘drug deal gone bad’, defense, with which his client was so enamored, or, as he decided to do, he could argue in the alternative — ‘believe the defendant Smith, but if you don’t, there is still reasonable doubt with respect to Smith’s guilt.’ ” Because that decision was an objectively reasonable one, the court concluded, it did not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>

By not doing so, Smith contends, Horton “blotted out” his chosen defense and prevented him from effectively presenting that defense to the jury. Moreover, Smith adds, Horton damaged his credibility with the jury by implicitly conveying the impression that even his attorney disbelieved him. Indeed, Smith asserts, Horton blatantly contradicted his testimony by affirming Knott’s credibility and by essentially conceding the robberies and the guilt of his co-defendant Kuhn. These charges raise some serious questions, but they do not persuade us that the performance of Smith’s trial counsel was deficient under the circumstances presented. Rather, we agree with the trial court that Horton adopted and carried out an objectively reasonable and permissible strategy for his closing argument. He did not render ineffective assistance.</p>

Horton called Smith to the witness stand. Through direct examination of his client, without undermining Smith in any way, Horton fully elicited his testimony that there was no robbery. Nor did Horton disavow Smith’s “drug deal gone bad” defense in his closing argument; rather, Horton expressly asked the jury to believe his client (“He credibly told you what happened that night....
