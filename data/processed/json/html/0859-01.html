The [Appellant] returned home and the girlfriend related to the [Appellant] that during the robbery “a whole bunch of guys ran in with masks and hoodies.” (N.T. 1/28/98 p. 108 1).

Also present at the Robles’ home that day was the third Co-Defendant, Roderick Johnson. When Bridges and Morales first arrived, they spoke with Co-Defendant Johnson, but soon thereafter, they called Robles downstairs. Robles testified at trial that Bridges explained, “ ... how the Banks’ boys went in his house with guns to his girlfriend’s head and his kid was there and how he was going to take care of them right now.” (N.T. 1/29/98 p. 1057). During the same conversation, the [Appellant] said, “I gotta take them out. I am gonna get them and I’m gonna kill them and I’m going to put an end to this forever. Because if I let them get away with it now they are going to try to do it again so I’m going to have to do what I have to do.” (N.T. 1/29/98 p. 1058). Then all three co-defendants tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Mr. Robles to join them. Despite Mr. Robles’ refusal, the conversation continued with all three co-defendants saying, “we are gonna kill them. We are going to put an end to this.” (N.T. 1/29/98 p. 1058). At approximately this point in the conversation, the [Appellant] pulled out a 9 mm. Glock handgun and continued to say how he was “gonna kill them.” ’ (N.T. 1/29/98 p. 1059). As the planning progressed, the three talked about when the killings would take place. According to Robles, Roderick Johnson wanted to implement their plan immediately, but [Appellant] Bridges wanted to “wait until it gets dark because then we don’t have to worry about as many people.” (N.T. 1/29/98 p. 1061).</blockquote>

The [Appellant), Shawnfatee Bridges, went in the house and talked with the victims, Damon and Gregory Banks. Before leaving, Damon Banks went upstairs and, unbeknownst to Bridges, loaded a .32 caliber automatic handgun which he took with him. (N.T. 1/28/98 p. 10). The three co-defendants and the two victims left the home of Damon and Greg Banks at approximately 6:00 PM. All five of them left in the blue Plymouth Voyager owned by the [Appellant].

At that point, again according to Bridges’ own statement, the [Appellant] saw a gun on the floor and began to shoot in the direction of Johnson. When Johnson began to run away from the van, Bridges returned to the van and left. Bridges drove to a street corner in Reading and poured gasoline in the van and set a match to it, completely gutting the van. At that point the [Appellant] returned home. Subsequently, Johnson was located approximately four miles’ away from the scene of the shooting, at the Queen City Restaurant. He was transported to the Reading Hospital, where the bullet was surgically removed. Eventually, the [Appellant] went to the home of Richard Morales and stayed there overnight. The next day, as news about the Banks shooting, the shooting of Roderick Johnson, and the burning of the [Appellant]^ van began to spread, the [Appellant] called a friend of his to take him to the airport in Philadelphia, ostensibly to visit relatives.</blockquote>

Among the evidence collected were eight (8) 9 mm. shell casings. (N.T. 1/27/98 p. 817). In addition, in a separate location, officers located a 9 mm. bullet and another shell casing. (N.T. 1/27/98 p. 820). In addition, Officer Rowe, of the Reading Police Department, was dispatched to the scene of the van fire. That night officers collected one spent shell casing and one shotgun. Subsequently, investigators sifted through the charred remains of the van and discovered an additional bullet. Both of the bullets were analyzed and found to be .9 mm. projectiles.</blockquote>

Additionally, he testified that, the body of Damon Banks sustained thirteen (13) bullet wounds. One of the thirteen projectiles was bullet “D” which entered the victim at the back, right side of the neck where it severed the spinal cord. According to Dr. Hoffman, this instantaneously rendered Damon Banks a quadriplegic. (N.T. 1/29/98 p. 1215).

Appellant claims that the purpose of this testimony was to demonstrate the omission of certain facts from Robles’ prior testimony, and the inconsistency between the prior testimony and Robles’ testimony at Appellant’s trial. After reviewing the transcript of Johnson’s trial, the trial court sustained an objection to much of the proposed testimony, finding that the questioning of Robles during the Johnson trial was not sufficiently specific to establish impeachment by omission.

He claims that the only purpose in pursuing this line of questioning was to paint him as a violent individual who would routinely engage in acts of retaliation against individuals for drug related reasons.

The jury foreman responded: “I think we have some questions that we’ll talk about when we get upstairs.” N.T. 2/5/98 p. 1672. Appellant claims that based on this statement, it is a reasonable inference that some extraneous matters had entered jury deliberations prior to the jury returning to the courtroom. The position of the Appellant is that because the jury was sent home for the night, this provided all jurors the opportunity to obtain information, discuss the case with others, and access the Internet for research. At trial on the morning of February 5, 1998, defense counsel asked the court to inquire of the jury whether any of them had discussed the matter or conducted research. The court did so, with no response from the jury. N.T. 2/5/98 p. 1691. Nevertheless, after the jury returned with a verdict, Appellant filed a motion to authorize an investigation into the possibility that extraneous evidence had entered jury deliberation.

Similarly, the testimony from the pretrial hearings in the present case establishes that Appellant had made most of the incriminating admissions that appear in Appellant’s written statement during his answers to questions asked within the first six hours of his custodial interrogation. Thus, even if Appellant were considered to be "under arrest” for the murders of the Banks cousins on December 16, rather than subject merely to a custodial interrogation, his subsequent written statement amounted to not much more than a restatement of his earlier oral admissions. Consequently, pursuant to <em>Hughes, </em>suppression on <em>Davenport/Duncan </em>grounds would not be warranted.</p>

Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/521/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="231" data-cite="521 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1817459" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0423-01">521 Pa. 423</a>, 451, <a href="/pa/521/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="521 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1817459" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0423-01">555 A.2d 1264</a>, 1278 (1989), is controlling. In text, however, the majority also holds that the six-hour rule does not apply to a custodial interrogation where the defendant has not been formally placed under arrest for the crime about which he or she is being questioned. I disagree that application of a judicially-imposed, bright-line rule set out to advance the salutary purposes of assuring prompt arraignment and controlling the effects of custodial interrogation should depend entirely upon the context, or potentially pretext, initially employed by law enforcement officers to bring the defendant into the interrogation setting. In my view, as the rule is formulated, the policies underlying it can be consistently effectuated only if the subject matter of the custodial interrogation is made the controlling consideration, as was suggested in <em>Commonwealth v.
