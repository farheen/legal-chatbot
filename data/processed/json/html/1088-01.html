In addition to the Murtha affidavit, appellant relied on the affidavit of Seymour Smith, the deputy general counsel, and the deposition of Robert Jones, LCE’s regional director. She emphasized that Mr. Smith was the deputy general counsel for all three corporate entities, that Mr. Jones performed monthly inspections of the Loews theaters in Maryland and Virginia, that individual theater managers faxed maintenance requests to the regional director in the District of Columbia and reported to him, and that the maintenance worker reporting to the regional director in the District received his assignments in the District and regularly traveled to the suburban locations to perform repair duties.</p>

There may be cases in which “personal jurisdiction has been asserted over a subsidiary based on the activities of its parent.” <em>Gonzalez, </em><a href="/a2d/891/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="891 A.2d 227" data-case-ids="8990283" data-case-paths="/a2d/891/0227-01">891 A.2d at </a>239 (citing one case from Kansas). This cannot happen, however, unless there is evidence that "the parent [in this case, LCE] so controls and dominates the subsidiary [in this case, LWC] as in effect to disregard the latter's independent corporate existence.” Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 52, comment b, at 180-181 (1971). Absent such evidence (and in this case there is none), we know of no authority that would make the subsidiary corporation subject to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in a forum where only the parent corporation transacts business. <em>See Gonzalez, </em><a href="/a2d/891/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="891 A.2d 227" data-case-ids="8990283" data-case-paths="/a2d/891/0227-01">891 A.2d at 239-240</a>.</p>
