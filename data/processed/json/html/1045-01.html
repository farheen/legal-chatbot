Because this man, unlike in the grand jury, this man wasn’t there.” Simpson’s attorney objected to this statement as well, and after closing argument he made a motion for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecutor was “improperly suggesting that Mr. Simpson [was] somehow affecting Mr. Crawford’s testimony” by exercising his right to be present at his own trial. The trial judge “did not hear it that way,” and denied the motion for a mistrial, stating that “it is fair inference from the evidence that someone would be reluctant to accuse someone who is sitting across from [him].”</p>

In this case, the government did not elicit testimony that Hymes feared the defendant. Nonetheless, even though Hymes did not testify that he was afraid of Simpson or of any of Simpson’s associates, the prosecutor’s rebuttal argument quoted above suggested, almost expressly, that Hymes had-lied to the defense investigator out of fear of Simpson. According to the prosecutor, if Hymes had told Simpson’s investigator that Simpson was the shooter, Hymes would assume that the investigator would “tell [Simpson] and everyone” what Hymes had said, with the result that Hymes “might have been a little afraid.” Given the way the prosecutor expressed it, no possible source of Hymes’s fear other than Simpson was readily inferable by the jury. Absent a factual basis for such a comment by the prosecutor, our case law has been strict in stating that suggestions of fear are forbidden. We conclude, accordingly, that there was prosecutorial error. <em>See Murray v.

We are not persuaded by Simpson’s claim that the prosecutor’s statement that Crawford “didn’t want to tell what he saw or heard from this man <a id="p1049" href="#p1049" data-label="1049" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1049</a>... [bjecause this man, unlike in the grand jury, this man wasn’t there,” violated Simpson’s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment assures a criminal defendant of the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” This right is invaluable, for it “forces the witness to submit to cross-examination, the ‘greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of the truth.’” <em>California v. Green, </em><a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">399 U.S. 149</a>, 158, <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">90 S.Ct. 1930</a>, <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">26 L.Ed.2d 489</a> (1970) (quoting 5 J. WIGMORE, EVIDENCE § 1367 (3d ed.1940)). Here, Simpson was afforded all of the rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause. Crawford appeared at trial and Simpson was able to confront him face-to-face. While he was on the witness stand, Crawford faced extensive cross-examination, during which he renounced his prior inculpatory statements. The “legal engine” of cross-examination thus placed two irreconcilable accounts before the jury; one inculpatory, the other not (Crawford claimed that he did not recall). The determination of which, if either, account was credible was for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b1077-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1077.5",1077,[141,1760,751,916]]]'>Simpson would have us hold that Crawford’s in-court testimony was subject to cross-examination, that it was therefore “preferfred],” and that the prosecutor should not have been permitted to argue that the account Crawford gave outside Simpson’s presence was more reliable than his in-court testimony. There is no authority for such a holding. Although the Framers made a judgment, as represented in the Confrontation Clause, that confrontation and cross-examination are helpful engines through which the truth may be revealed, that does not mean that <em>every </em>account given in the courtroom and subject to cross-examination is more rehable than <em>every </em>statement made outside the presence of the accused.</p>
    <p id="b1077-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1077.6",1077,[942,277,757,1237]]]'>Common sense tells us that in certain circumstances, face-to-face confrontation between the witness and defendant may have the effect of <em>inhibiting </em>the truth from emerging. For example, a witness may be hesitant to testify in open court against a close friend, where the witness’ testimony would be likely to result in the friend’s conviction of murder and resulting long-term incarceration; here, Crawford and Simpson were close friends. And, of course, intimidation or the fear thereof can offset the benefits of face-to-face confrontation. Children alleging that they have been sexually abused, for example, are sometimes permitted to testify outside the presence of the accused, with the latter following the proceedings on closed circuit television, for in such circumstances “there is evidence that such confrontation would in fact <em>disserve </em>the Confrontation Clause’s truth-seeking goal.” <em>Maryland v.

One does not have to hold a degree in psychology to recognize that a witness may be reluctant, in the presence of a close friend, to say the words which may send the friend to prison for the remainder of his life. Viewed in this light, “the comment merely stated the obvious to the jurors and constituted a reasonable inference from the evidence.” <em>See Clayborne v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/751/0956-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="751 A.2d 956" data-case-ids="11512808" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0956-01">751 A.2d 956</a>, 969 (D.C.2000).

We acknowledge that the prosecution’s case certainly had its problems. There was no direct evidence (e.g., weapons evidence, fingerprints) inculpating Simpson. As we have seen, moreover, two of Simpson’s principal accusers, Hymes and Crawford, made exculpatory statements as well as inculpatory ones. Furthermore, although LaDonia Boggs testified that she saw Simpson shoot the decedent, Ms. Boggs’ sister testified that LaDonia could not have seen the murder from her location at the time. Finally, although the prosecution introduced evidence that Simpson had made threats against the decedent, the defense presented evidence tending to show that Simpson and the decedent had later worked things out. Nonetheless, LaDonia Doggs <em>did </em>identify Simpson as the shooter; Crawford <em>did </em>testify that Simpson had admitted committing the murder; and there <em>was </em>testimony that, before the murder, Simpson had threatened the decedent. It was for the jury to determine what evidence was credible. After a careful review of the entire record, we conclude that the prosecutor’s comment in rebuttal about Hymes’s fear could not, in our judgment, have had an effect on the outcome amounting to harmful, reversible error. <em>See Kotteakos v.

The Court distinguished <em>Griffin </em>as a situation in which the prosecutor was prohibited from urging the jurors to do something they were "not permitted to do,” whereas in <em>Portuondo, </em>“it [was] natural and irresistible for a jury, in evaluating the relative credibility of a defen- ' dant who testifies last, to have in mind and weigh in the balance the fact that he heard the testimony of all those who preceded him.” <em><a href="/us/529/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="529 U.S. 61" data-case-ids="9508173" data-case-paths="/us/529/0061-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/529/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="529 U.S. 61" data-case-ids="9508173" data-case-paths="/us/529/0061-01">at 67-68</a>, <a href="/us/529/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="529 U.S. 61" data-case-ids="9508173" data-case-paths="/us/529/0061-01">120 S.Ct. 1119</a>.</p>

In my opinion, this notion is quite unrealistic. Hymes testified that when he was first approached by a defense investigator, he withheld information about the murder <a id="p1051" href="#p1051" data-label="1051" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1051</a>because he “did not want to get involved.” In the courtroom, at trial, Hymes declared that he did not want to be there and that he did not want to be a witness. Hymes consistently exhibited extreme reluctance to have anything to do with criminal proceedings related to the murder to which he was a witness. His reluctance was quite understandable, for as we have recognized, “the instinct for self-preservation” after witnessing a murder “is well-nigh universal.” <em>Outlaw v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/632/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="632 A.2d 408" data-case-ids="7368451" data-case-paths="/a2d/632/0408-01">632 A.2d 408</a>, 409 n. 1 (D.C.1993). Circumstantial evidence can be just as probative as direct evidence, and although a prosecutor may not “rely on evidence that has not been presented,” he or she is “entitled to make reasonable comments on the evidence and to argue all reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial.” <em>Clayborne v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/751/0956-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="751 A.2d 956" data-case-ids="11512808" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0956-01">751 A.2d 956</a>, 969 (D.C.2000).</p>
    <p id="b1079-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1079.5",1079,[138,1449,753,1228]]]'>Although Hymes never explicitly so stated, his testimony that he “did not want to get involved” with this murder trial and his insistence on the witness stand that he did not want to be there permitted the jury to draw the reasonable, if not obvious, inference that his reluctance to testify may have been generated by, or at least related to, his apprehension of the potential consequences. The law “does not require judges to shut their minds to that which all others can see or understand.” <em>Poulnot v. District of Columbia, </em><a href="/a2d/608/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="608 A.2d 134" data-case-ids="7927316" data-case-paths="/a2d/608/0134-01">608 A.2d 134</a>, 141 (D.C.1992) (citing <em>Child Labor Tax Case, </em><a href="/us/259/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="259 U.S. 20" data-case-ids="423340" data-case-paths="/us/259/0020-01">259 U.S. 20</a>, 37, <a href="/us/259/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="259 U.S. 20" data-case-ids="423340" data-case-paths="/us/259/0020-01">42 S.Ct. 449</a>, <a href="/us/259/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="259 U.S. 20" data-case-ids="423340" data-case-paths="/us/259/0020-01">66 L.Ed. 817</a> (1922)). Considering the realities of the situation, the prosecutor’s rather mild observation that “maybe [Hymes] might have been a little afraid” was surely a “reasonable comment” on the evidence. The jurors would undoubtedly have recognized the realities on which the remark was based whether the prosecutor had mentioned the matter or not.</p>
