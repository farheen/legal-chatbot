Ferrell appealed on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We think the evidence was sufficient, though not overwhelming (or even strong), but we need not discuss that issue. As we explain below, but for the trial court’s failure to correct the prosecutor’s misapprehension that the government required leave of court to dismiss the case — as the prosecutor told the court he wanted to do before the court declared a recess in the trial — the case would have been dismissed. We conclude that this omission by the court was plain error; that <a id="p1017" href="#p1017" data-label="1017" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1017</a>this plain error — coming as it did on the heel of comments that the trial judge erroneously interjected, expressing her disagreement with the prosecutor’s assessment of the evidence — affected appellant’s substantial rights; and that together the errors seriously undermined the integrity of the proceedings. We therefore reverse appellant’s conviction.</p>

The assault charge arose out of an incident that occurred on July 7, 2006, at the Washington Hospital Center. Special Police Officer Seth Massie testified that he witnessed an altercation between appellant and appellant’s sister in the intake area of the hospital’s emergency room. After the sister’s conduct became “boisterous,” other officers whom Officer Massie had summoned to the scene struggled to handcuff her. Appellant, attempting to intervene to prevent his sister’s arrest, shoved two of the officers, including Officer Donald Owens. Thereafter, officers tried to handcuff appellant, and a struggle ensued. Appellant continued struggling after Officer Owens, Officer Massie and two other officers “got [appellant] on the ground.” Officer Massie testified that he was standing over appellant, who was face-down on the ground, after police had succeeded in getting one handcuff on him. As police continued to try to handcuff appellant, appellant’s leg and foot “lunged up” and his foot “hit [Officer Mas-sie] in the groin.” Officer Massie explained that appellant “bent his knee up” and “that’s how his foot came up.” The officer testified that appellant’s “kick” was hard enough for him “to feel some pain.”</p>

The prosecutor explained that when he spoke with Officer Massie prior to trial, the officer told him that appellant had “kicked” him, and that not until the course of the officer’s testimony did the Government “come to the belief that that kick [to Officer Massie] does not meet the elements of simple assault.” The court denied the motion to amend the information, citing prejudice to the defense and finding that the government had not demonstrated good cause for the proposed amendment.

The government argued that it was enough that appellant “intended to kick out” when officers were around him and “intended to strike out.” The court denied the motion, and after the defense rested without presenting any witnesses and counsel had made their closing arguments, the court found appellant guilty of assault. The court reasoned that appellant knew that police officers were around him, that he used force “voluntarily and on purpose,” and that his use of force to kick and injure Officer Massie was neither a mistake nor an accident.</p>

    <p id="b1061-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1061.6",1061,[143,615,759,1499]]]'>Focusing on the fact that Rule 48(a)(1) does not require the government to obtain leave of court to dismiss a case, appellant contends in his supplemental brief that the court had “no discretion to weigh or inquire into the reasons for the government’s dismissal of a criminal information” and “exceeded its authority by questioning the prosecutor on his rationale for dismissing the case mid trial, stating that it disagreed with the proffered reasons and then recessing the trial to take the matter under advisement.” He argues that “[gjiven that the trial had commenced and jeopardy had attached, the case should have been dismissed with prejudice.” The government, by contrast, emphasizes in its supplemental brief that “because the government withdrew its request to dismiss the matter before the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered on the court docket, the trial court did not plainly err by allowing the trial to proceed.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As the foregoing argument reflects, the government’s position is that, in light of appellant’s failure to object to the court’s handling of the proceeding after the prosecutor mentioned dismissal, this court’s review of any issue relating to Rule 48(a)(1) must be under the plain-error standard of review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In a somewhat analogous circumstance involving application of Fed. R.Crim.P. 48(a), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded that the district court “overstepped its authority and abused its discretion” when the court, hearing that the prosecution intended to seek leave of court to dismiss the case, “disagreed with the prosecutor’s assessment” (of what penalties the defendants should face). <em>United States v.

Indeed, at least until he heard the court’s assessment of the evidence, the prosecutor — who did “not believe the evidence would establish an intentional kicking of [Officer Massie]”— had an obligation to dismiss, since the Rules of Professional Conduct required him not to “[pjrosecute ... a charge that [he] knows is not supported by evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie showing of guilt[.]” D.C.

Although we do not suggest that the court here intended to interfere with the prosecutor’s decision, we are persuaded that the trial court did err by interjecting its comment about the sufficiency of the evidence, at a point when the government had already announced an intent to dismiss the case. Upon any reasonable reading of the record, there can be no doubt that the effect of the court’s comment was to intrude upon the prerogative of the Executive Branch, ultimately (in conjunction with the second critical fact that we discuss below) depriving appellant of the benefit of a decision by the prosecutor to dismiss the charges “at this time.”</p>

Because the court clearly lacked the authority either to grant or to deny the “motion,” the only appropriate and legally correct response to the prosecutor’s purported motion was for the judge to explain that she had no authority to entertain such a motion because she was not the decision-maker and because the substantive prerequisite for dismissal had already been satisfied. Whether the court, like the prosecutor, actually misapprehended Rule 48(a)(1) is subject to some debate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We are in agreement, however, that the case would have been dismissed if the court had corrected the prosecutor’s misapprehension before the recess. Even if the court was not acting upon its own misapprehension of Rule 48(a)(1), in light of the fact that the Rule gave the court no continuing role after the prosecutor had announced dismissal “at this time” and after the defense had agreed to dismissal, the court should simply have dismissed the case before taking its recess. The recess, coming on the heels of the judge’s gratuitous statement contradicting the prosecutor’s view about the sufficiency of the government’s evidence, led to the government’s withdrawal, following the recess, of its decision (or “request”) to dismiss the charge against appellant. The net effect was that the decision not to dismiss the case was effectively made by the judge, not by the prosecutor, in contravention of the plain terms of Rule 48(a)(1) and separation-of-powers principles.</p>

Thus, the government urges us to apply the plain-error standard of review. We have some doubt as to whether, on the facts of this case, the defense’s failure to object before the recess limits appellant to plain-error review. From the court’s statements during the judge’s brief colloquy with the prosecutor, we think defense counsel could not have been sure whether the court actually misapprehended Rule 48(a)(1). We also think that, up until the judge abruptly called a recess, the defense could not have anticipated the eventual impact of the court’s comment about the evidence.

We also are persuaded that this plain-error test is satisfied with respect to the court’s decision to declare a recess before dismissing the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> As to the first two prongs of the test, given the language of Rule 48(a)(1), we are satisfied that the court plainly erred by allowing the case to continue, into a recess, once the prosecutor had announced dismissal “at this time” and the defense had agreed. To repeat what we explained above, the only legally correct response to the prosecutor’s “request” to dismiss was for the court to explain that it was not the decision-maker and promptly to dismiss the case since the substantive prerequisite for dismissal (the defendant’s agreement) had already been satisfied. Prong three of the test is satisfied because the error affected appellant’s substantial rights: but for the court’s failure to respond in a legally correct way to the dismissal “request,” appellant would have been excused, and there is a reason<a id="p1023" href="#p1023" data-label="1023" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1023</a>able probability that the prosecutor would have filed the <em>nolle prosequi </em>papers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The error thus deprived appellant of the benefit of a decision by the prosecutor to dismiss the charges “at this time.” Finally, as to prong four, the effective substitution of the judge’s views for the prosecutor’s with respect to whether the prosecution could be continued in good faith seriously affected the fairness and the integrity of the proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> We therefore conclude that reversal is required.</p>

As a matter of courtesy, the prosecutor called the district judge to inform him of the agreement. No record exists of this conversation, and the parties acknowledge that their memories of the conversation are imperfect. The result of the conversation, however, is not in dispute. After telling the district judge that she intended to dismiss the federal indictments because the penalty in state court was, in her opinion, sufficient punishment for the defendants’ crimes, the Assistant United States Attorney was given to understand that the district court would not grant leave of court to dismiss the indictment because it did not consider the dismissal to be in the public interest.</blockquote>

While the court's statement to the prosecutor “you’ve now requested that the case be dismissed” suggests that the court incorrectly recollected what Rule 48(a)(1) states, at other points during the proceeding the court appeared to understand that the rule makes no provision for participation by the trial judge in the decision to dismiss. The court asked, "Why is the government dismissing the case?” and said to the prosecutor, "But you’ve dismissed the case” — both quotes suggesting that the court <em>did </em>understand that the government did not require leave of court for dismissal. The transcript does not make clear whether the court declared a recess because it needed time to study Rule 48(a)(1), whether the court intended to "rule” on the government's "request” after the recess, or whether the court called a break in the proceedings for a reason wholly unrelated to the issue of dismissal.</p>
