    <p id="b247-21" data-blocks='[["BL_247.19",247,[1015,814,745,278]]]'>In this action a customer sued a stockbroker to recover the amount paid by the customer to the broker for the purchase of certain shares of stock which had not been delivered. Judgment went for the customer and the broker has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b247-22" data-blocks='[["BL_247.20",247,[1015,1149,746,1044]]]'>From the evidence (little of which was conflicting) the trial court could have found the following facts. On March 7, 1961, the customer placed an order for 200 shares of stock of Permachem Corporation; on March 8 the broker confirmed the order; and on March 13 the customer paid the broker $490.50. The customer requested that the stock be registered either in his name or in the joint names of himself and his wife. About two weeks' after placing the order, and frequently thereafter, the customer requested delivery of the stock. On each occasion he was told that the stock was “in transfer.” On August 8, 1961, the broker informed the customer that Permachem Corporation was in receivership and the transfer could not be effected. The broker then tendered the stock to the customer in “street name,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but the customer refused to accept it and demanded return of the purchase price.</p>

It offered no explanation for this delay. The broker also admitted it was notified by letter of July 11 that Permachem was in <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>receivership, but did not explain why this' information was not conveyed to the cus-' tomer until August 8.</p>

    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.6",248,[207,745,747,703]]]'>The broker was the agent of the customer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As his agent, the broker was under a duty to execute the customer’s order in conformity with the customer’s instructions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and to comply with the • instructions by -tendering delivery within a reasonable time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Here there was a delay of nearly five months from the placing of the order until the tender of delivery. The trial court was justified in finding there was no reasonable excuse for this delay and that the customer properly refused the tender.

It follows, argues the broker, that if it were negligent in carrying out the customer’s order it is liable only for damages resulting from such negligence and that no damages were proved. In support of this argument the broker cites Connelly v.
