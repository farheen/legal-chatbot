Counsel, who was appointed to represent Jun-kins on appeal, has requested leave to withdraw on the ground that the appeal is frivolous. Counsel has submitted a brief summarizing the facts and outlining four potential arguments on appeal. Junkins has submitted, pro se, a request that counsel not be allowed to withdraw, and he asks that counsel be required to brief two issues. We conclude that the appeal is not frivolous; we deny counsel’s request to withdraw; and we require counsel to brief the potential issues he has identified.</p>

Lafoe was the caretaker of Verna Junkins, who was frail and suffering from dementia. She was known to keep fi&gt;om $2000 to $6000 in $20 bills in her purse at any given time. On the evening that La-foe died, Verna Junkins had injuries to her neck consistent with having been choked or smothered. Her purse and Lafoe’s wallet were missing and never recovered.</p>

The evidence at trial included testimony that, soon after the murder, Raymond’s shirt was bloody and he had a substantial amount of cash in $20 bills. When his girlfriend asked where he got the money, he said he stole it. Raymond’s ex-wife testified that on September 4, he asked her to lie to anyone who inquired about his whereabouts on the evening of the murder and to say that he was with her. He asked her to dispose of a black trash bag. A friend, who had posted bail for Raymond on an escape charge pending in New Hampshire, testified that she told Raymond that she would turn him over to New Hampshire officials if he did not pay a substantial debt he owed her. Raymond paid her in $20 bills shortly after Lafoe’s murder.</p>

Nonetheless, counsel identified four potential issues: (1) the sufficiency of the evidence; (2) an evidentiary ruling excluding statements by Verna Jun-kins to the police shortly after the murder; (3) an evidentiary ruling allowing evidence of the New Hampshire charge of escape pending against Junkins; and (4) whether the jury pool was tainted by remarks from a member of the pool.</p>

Counsel also attests that he has reviewed the record, explained his evaluation to the defendant, provided the defendant with a copy of the brief, and informed the defendant of the right to file a pro se supplemental brief. Under <em>Wende </em>counsel neither explicitly states that the appeal is frivolous nor requests leave to withdraw. The appellate court conducts a review of the entire record. If it determines the appeal is frivolous it may dismiss it. If it determines that any issue is arguable it orders further briefing on that issue.

Aspects of the <em>Wende </em>procedure that the Court expressly approved include: (1) the determination by both counsel and the appellate court that the appeal is frivolous; (2) counsel is not allowed to withdraw; and (3) the submission of a brief with the procedural and factual history and citations to the record ensures that counsel has examined the record and aids the appellate court is its own evaluation. <em>Smith v.

The issues raised by counsel and by Junkins are not frivolous, and, thus, this case does not squarely present the dilemma of a frivolous appeal. Furthermore, from our lack of discussion of this issue in the thirty-four years since <em>Anders </em>was decided, it appears that appellate counsel in Maine generally follow the American Bar Association Standard for Criminal Justice, Standard 4-8.3 (3rd ed.1993), Counsel on Appeal. Under that standard, appellate counsel does not seek to withdraw from a criminal appeal solely because counsel has determined <a id="p951" href="#p951" data-label="951" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*951</a>that the appeal has no merit; if counsel cannot persuade the client to abandon a wholly frivolous appeal, counsel proceeds to represent the client with effective, quality representation. <em>See </em>James E. Duggan &amp; Andrew W. Moeller, <em>Make Way for the ABA: Smith v. Robbins Clears a Path for Anders Alternatives, </em>3 J. APP. PRAC. &amp; PROCESS 65, 98 n. 211 (2001) (suggesting that Maine follows the ABA approach de facto as a matter of practice); Martha C. Warner, <em>Anders in the Fifty States: Some Appellants’ Equal Protection is More Equal Than Others, </em>23 FLA. ST. U.L. REV. 625, 651 n. 212 (1996) (reporting that Maine is one of several states that receives no or only sporadic Anders-type briefs).</p>
