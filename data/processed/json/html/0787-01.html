Although our decision in that case made it unnecessary to rule on the standard of proof as to venue, we explained at length our belief that the gravity of the effect upon the judicial process, and upon a defendant’s rights, of a factual determination as to jurisdiction far exceeds that resulting from a determination as to venue. While we found the standard of proof for the issue of jurisdiction was proof beyond a reasonable doubt, we now believe that proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence comports with the lesser gravity of determinations as to venue. It is important to remember that in <em>Baldwin </em>if the Defendants’ acts took place outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Maine Courts, there would be no crime at all because if the acts were committed in New Hampshire there would have been no violation of Maine laws.

He paced this distance himself from the boundary marker to the parking spot and estimated the distance as 21 feet. Although the officer admitted he had never searched the records for an official description of the boundary, he said he had a general knowledge of the geographical area and had travelled and worked in the area on many occasions.

Undoubtedly the same principle should apply as to place. But in State v. Wedge, Me., <a href="/a2d/322/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="322 A.2d 328" data-case-ids="8051929" data-case-paths="/a2d/322/0328-01">322 A.2d 328</a> (1974) we followed the majority rule that a variance between allegation and proof is not grounds for reversal unless it appears that the Defendant was prejudiced by the variance.</p>
