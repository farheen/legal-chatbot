Keniston appeals from an order entered in the Superior Court (Cumberland County, <em>Cole, J.) </em>granting JPMorgan Chase Bank’s (JPMorgan) motion for a summary judgment and denying her motion for a summary judgment, and from the court’s order denying her motion for reconsideration. Keniston contends that the court erred in granting JPMor-gan’s motion for a summary judgment, that the court failed to consider her claim for equitable relief, and that the court erred in denying her motion for a summary judgment. For reasons discussed below, however, this appeal is dismissed as interlocutory.</p>
    <p id="b485-20" data-blocks='[["BL_485.19",485,[964,1833,755,823]]]'>[¶ 2] Keniston and her then-husband, Dana A. Keniston, separated in July 1997 and were divorced in October 2000. The divorce court’s (West Bath, <em>Vafiades, J.) </em>order provided that real property in both their names was to be set aside to Keni-ston as her “sole and exclusive property.” The order also provided that “each party shall assume, pay and hold the other harmless from all credit card and other debt standing in the name of each party.” Keniston was ordered to “be responsible for preparing and recording the abstract of the divorce decree and for paying the recording fees thereon.” She failed to do so until March 5, 2004.</p>

      <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>[¶ 8] While he was separated from Keniston, Dana made purchases using a Providian National Bank (Providian) credit card held in his name. In April 2002, Providian recovered judgment in the District Court <em>(Westcott, J.) </em>against Dana in the amount of $24,198.57 plus prejudgment interest for the debt incurred by Dana. Unbeknownst to Keniston, Providian recorded a writ of execution against Dana in the Cumberland County Registry of Deeds on May 31, 2002, in the amount of $27,242.05. Because Keniston had failed to record the abstract of the divorce decree, the writ of execution became a lien on Keniston’s real property. Keniston first learned of the encumbrance in 2004 when she tried to refinance her property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On August 9, 2004, the United States Bankruptcy Court granted Dana a discharge under Chapter Seven.</p>

Keniston opposed JPMorgan’s motion, arguing that, although the writ of execution had been recorded before she recorded an abstract of her divorce judgment, she should be allowed to present her case for equitable relief from the writ of execution operating as a lien on property set aside to her in the divorce judgment.</p>
    <p id="b486-8" data-blocks='[["BL_486.8",486,[1009,685,752,869]]]'>[¶ 6] Keniston also filed a cross-motion for a summary judgment, arguing that she should be granted a summary judgment, primarily because JPMorgan failed to provide admissible evidence that it was the current owner of the Providian debt and lien. In its statement of material facts filed in opposition to Keniston’s motion, JPMorgan acknowledged for the first time that it was not the assignee of Providian, but that Chase Bank, USA, N.A. (Chase), a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase and Co. (which also owns JPMor-gan) was the actual successor-in-interest to the Providian debt and lien and that Chase had subsequently sold all its rights to B-Line, LLC in March 2003.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

She argues on appeal that JPMor-gan failed to show that the writ of execution on the judgment against Dana was perfected, thereby precluding a summary judgment in JPMorgan’s favor. This argument is without merit. By statute, a judgment-creditor is required to notify the judgment-debtor that a lien has been filed within twenty days after recording the writ of execution. 14 M.R.S. 4651-A(5) (2006). Keniston is not the judgment-debtor in this case.</p>

The existence of a dispute of material facts and entry of a summary judgment are questions of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Stanley v. Hancock County Comm’rs, </em><a href="/a2d/864/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2004 ME 157" data-case-ids="9039845" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/0169-01">2004 ME 157</a>, ¶ 13, <a href="/a2d/864/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2004 ME 157" data-case-ids="9039845" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/0169-01">864 A.2d 169</a>, 174. Were we to rule on the merits of this case, we would likely find a dispute of material fact. There are uncontroverted statements in the complaint and JPMorgan’s answer that JPMorgan was the "successor-in-interest to Providian,” but this does not demonstrate that JPMorgan was the successor-in-interest <em>to the debt </em>owed by Dana. <em>See Beaulieu v. The Aube Corp., </em><a href="/a2d/797/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2002 ME 79" data-case-ids="9429071,9441562" data-case-paths="/a2d/797/0027-01,/a2d/796/0683-01">2002 ME 79</a>, ¶ 2, <a href="/a2d/796/0683-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="796 A.2d 683" data-case-ids="9441562" data-case-paths="/a2d/796/0683-01">796 A.2d 683</a>, 685 ("Where ambiguities exist, they are resolved in favor of the non-prevailing party on summary judgment.”). Furthermore, JPMorgan admitted in its opposition to Keniston’s motion for a summary judgment that it never owned the debt owed by Dana, but that the debt had been owned by Chase, which transferred it to B-Line. These facts, although submitted with respect to a different motion, refute the ambiguity JPMorgan seeks to exploit in its own motion for a summary judgment.</p>

An equitable remedy will not be granted when there exists an adequate remedy at law or when an adequate legal remedy, once available, has been lost by the failure of the party seeking equitable relief to pursue that remedy in a timely manner. <em>McIntyre v.

The court viewed Keniston's opportunity to have <em>prevented </em>a problem from arising <em>(i.e., </em>by recording her interest before Providian) as her having had an adequate <em>remedy </em>at law to redress the problem that arose <em>because </em>Providian recorded first.</p>
