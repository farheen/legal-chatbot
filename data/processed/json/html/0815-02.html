Mr. El-kins, a lawyer, served as a trustee of Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital of Philadelphia from 1900 until his death in 1919 and served on the Trustee’s College Committee during the 1917-1918 session.</blockquote>

AHERF also controlled the Medical College of Pennsylvania (“MCP”), which likewise operated a medical school and hospital (the former Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania). Through a series of mergers and divisions in 1994, AHERF combined MCP and Hahnemann Medical College into the MCP Hahnemann School of Medicine.

As part of the implementation of that option, the various health-related schools formerly operating at Hahnemann Hospital (i.e., School of Nursing, etc.) were transferred to Drexel University.

The court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b862-9" data-blocks='[["BL_862.9",862,[1040,432,708,821]]]'>To start, Mr. Elkins’ choice of words is significant. He leaves the money in trust for the benefit of “the Hahnemann Hospital.” By the time Mr. Elkins executed his Will, the full corporate name of the entity was “Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital” and had been such for 50 years. Mr. Elkins, a lawyer who served on Hahnemann’s Board for nearly 20 years, surely would have known the full corporate name of the entity. Mr. Elkins reiterated that “the hospital” was his intended charitable purpose when, in the common subpart (f), he refers to “Hospitals aforesaid” and “the charity administered by them.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b862-10" data-blocks='[["BL_862.10",862,[1034,1275,708,508]]]'>It is also noteworthy that on all occasions where this issue has been raised, the trustee consistently has applied the “Trust’s income” to hospital operations at Hahnemann Hospital. After 1994 when the hospital and medical school were divided until 1998 when the hospital operations were sold to Tenet, the income from this Trust was paid to the hospital, not the medical school.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b862-11" data-blocks='[["BL_862.11",862,[1032,1806,713,871]],["BL_863.1",863,[217,262,712,355]]]'>At the hearing, the trustee’s principal witness was Jeffrey Eberly, senior executive director of finance and budget of PHEC. When asked what would be done with the income of this Trust if awarded to PHEC, he testified that “we would probably develop some community programs around the hospital.” He could not identify what community initiatives the Hahnemann community needs, and critically, it has <em>no proposal </em>for use of the Trust income. Mr. Eberly’s testimony about using the Trust income to establish and maintain a community-based health program confirms that the trustee believes decedent intended for the Trust income to be used for hospital <a id="p821" href="#p821" data-label="821" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*821</a>purposes, not for the medical school. No evidence was presented at the hearing to suggest that Trust income was ever used or could have been used for the operation of a medical school, as distinguished from the operations of a hospital.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b863-4" data-blocks='[["BL_863.4",863,[217,651,712,773]]]'>Trustee’s original Petition for Adjudication also confirms that the income from this Trust was intended for Hahne-mann Hospital, not Hahnemann Hospital and Medical School. The original Petition very clearly states that “the designated beneficiary, Hahnemann Hospital, <em>ceased to be a chanty </em>in November, 1998” when the assets of Hah-nemann Hospital were sold to Tenet, “causing a failure of the charitable purpose of this Trust.” This Petition then suggested that the Court award the Trust’s income to PHEC “by application of the doctrine of <em>cy pres.”</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b863-5" data-blocks='[["BL_863.5",863,[218,1458,713,1083]]]'>Finally, the conclusion that Mr. El-kins intended the Trust income to be used for a hospital, not a medical school, is buttressed by his involvement with Abington Hospital. In 1912, Mr. Elkins decided to build a local hospital, called “Abington General Hospital.” He donated farm land for the hospital and built the first hospital building. Shortly thereafter, upon the death of his wife, Mr. Elkins created a $250,000 trust for Abington’s benefit in her memory, and the hospital changed its name to “Abington Memorial Hospital” in her honor. There was extensive testimony about Mr. Elkins’ continued contributions to Abington. For purposes of this discussion, the evidence also showed that Abington was not established with a medical school component, but was committed solely to hospital care.</blockquote>

    <p id="b863-9" data-blocks='[["BL_863.7",863,[975,260,755,1108]]]'>¶ 6 Accordingly, based upon the above, the court concluded that Mr. Elkins intended that the Trust income was to be used for hospital operations and not the medical school (educational) component. Therefore, the court held that with the failure of the charitable purpose relating to Hahnemann Hospital, the doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>was applicable and that <em>Abington </em>Hospital most approximated Mr. Elkins’ intended object of his charitable gift. The court also concluded that “the charitable purposes and functions of PHEC [were] very different than the charitable purposes and functions that Mr. Elkins contemplated when he established this Trust for the benefit of Hahnemann Hospital.” <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. Specifically, the court determined that Mr. Elkins’ two gifts in trust were to benefit the two hospitals and the people that required “hospital-provided health care.” <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>

Abington is the second busiest hospital in the region and delivers more babies than any other hospital in Pennsylvania, except for one hospital in the Pittsburgh area. Abington has the only accredited trauma center in Montgomery County, and it provides free hospital care to residents of the region, not just the population of Abington Township. Most importantly, Abington remains an <em>independent not-for-profit hospital. </em>Abington’s present endowment is approximately $29 million including outside trusts established for its benefit. Abington uses the income from the separate trust created under Item 17(a) of Mr. Elkins’ Will for its general charitable purposes, consistent with the direction in Item 17(f) that the income be used “for the best interests of the charity administered by <a id="p822" href="#p822" data-label="822" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*822</a>them.” Abington Memorial Hospital would use this Trust’s income for those same charitable purposes.</blockquote>

Moreover, the court found that a significant portion of Abington’s $21,000,000 in free care in the previous year was provided to Philadelphia residents. Therefore, because Abington’s service area is not limited to the surrounding neighborhood, the court concluded that it served “an area consistent with Mr. Elkins’ intent.” <em>Id. </em>at 13. Accordingly, the court ordered that the Hahnemann Trust was to merge with the Abington Trust, that PNC was to administer the combined Trust as directed in Mr. Elkins’ will, and that Abington was to be awarded the retained income from the Trust.</p>

The court’s interpretation of the language of Mr. Elkins’ will, namely the phrase that “my Trustees shall pay over income ... to the Trustee of the said Hospitals to be used by them as their discretion may dictate to be for the best interests of the charity administered by them,” concomitantly with the specific identification of the two hospitals, cannot be deemed an error. The court relied on the language in the will, the circumstances existing at the time Mr. Elkins’ executed his will, and the payment of Trust income solely to the hospital after the relationship between the hospital and the medical school had been severed but prior to the sale of the hospital to Tenet. Moreover, the court found that no evidence was submitted indicating that Trust income was ever used in any way for medical school purposes. These findings, based upon the language of the will and other evidence presented, reveal a distinction1 between this case and <em>Baker, </em>where only a single function of the organization was eliminated and where the testator’s gift had been used from inception for all of <a id="p825" href="#p825" data-label="825" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*825</a>the institution’s purposes.

However, the Philadelphia Court did not have jurisdiction over the Trust assets, which are the subject of the present appeal. Rather it is .Montgomery County Orphans’ Court that has had and continues to have jurisdiction over the assets of the Trust itself. Therefore, the decision by the court in the present matter correctly noted the Philadelphia decrees, and did not disregard those decrees. Rather, the assets at issue in each proceeding were distinct and each court made determinations in regard to those separate assets, <em>i.e., </em>the charitable assets previously held by Hah-nemann versus the Trust assets.
