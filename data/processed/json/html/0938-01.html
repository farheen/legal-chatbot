In 1993, she became a leader in a movement against “gangsta rap.” Gangsta rap is known for its emphasis on violence, sex, drugs and criminal behavior. In her quest to stop the distribution of gangsta rap, Tucker became particularly focused on the work of Tupac Shakur, a noted gangsta rapper. A series of ^ lawsuits between Tucker, Shakur, and certain record producers ensued.</blockquote>

One song called Tucker a “m— f— [.]” Tucker claims that another song suggested that Tucker had “sold out” to the white establishment and invoked images of prostitution. In 1997, Tucker sued the estate of Shakur and the record companies responsible for distributing his records in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. <a id="p941" href="#p941" data-label="941" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*941</a>The lawsuit named the record companies as the principal wrongdoers in the action. Tucker claimed defamation of character, severe emotional distress and related pain and suffering. Tucker’s husband joined her lawsuit against the record companies, claiming that his wife’s injuries caused him to suffer a loss of advice, companionship and consortium.</blockquote>

Tucker stated that the [appellees] portrayed the complaint as solely against Shakur and focused improperly on her claim that the lyrics on Shakur’s album destroyed her sex life.

Further, they allege that, although a diminished sex life may be a part of a loss of consortium claim, this is only a small portion of the instant claim and “the media cannot treat every consortium claim as a claim for damage to one’s sexual relations with one’s spouse.” The Tuckers’ Reply Brief at 12.</p>

The difference between these two standards appears to be a matter of degree. In a case such as the present one, where we must treat as true all well-pleaded factual averments and fairly deducible inferences in order to determine whether a complaint has set forth a valid cause of action, this Court must carefully consider the damages pleaded. In the present case, the Tuckers alleged that they have been made objects of ridicule throughout the world. Such a sweeping allegation is more than a mere annoyance or embarrassment. Thus, we conclude that the Tuckers’ complaint sets forth a <em>prima, facie </em>case of defamation. The trial court erred when it reached a contrary conclusion.</p>
