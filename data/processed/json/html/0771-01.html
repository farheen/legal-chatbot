    <p id="b839-22" data-blocks='[["BL_839.23",839,[983,1279,757,661]]]'>On the evening of July 30,1988, at approximately 6:15 p.m., Diane L. Klopp (Klopp) was driving her motor vehicle in one of the two westbound lanes of Interstate 80, when she either slowed down or stopped on the roadway due to a sudden, heavy rainstorm. Consequently, Jackson,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> who was following Klopp in his tractor-trailer, jackknifed his vehicle in an attempt to stop so that he would not collide with her vehicle; this incident occurred at mile post number 227.1 of the highway. As a result, the jackknifed vehicle blocked both westbound lanes of the highway.</p>
    <p id="b839-23" data-blocks='[["BL_839.24",839,[984,1965,757,565]],["BL_840.1",840,[208,223,751,78]]]'>Traffic immediately began to accumulate behind the disabled vehicle. Two tractor-trailers, driven by John Barrett (Barrett) and Carol Porter (Porter), respectively, were the first vehicles to queue behind Jackson’s jackknifed tractor-trailer. Minutes after the accident, an electric utility line owned by Pennsylvania Power and Light Company (PPL), which had been strung across Interstate Route 80, sagged or fell for unknown reasons. The line came to rest on the ground across the eastbound lanes of traffic <a id="p774" href="#p774" data-label="774" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*774</a>and on top of Barrett’s and Porter’s vehicles in the westbound lanes.</p>
    <p id="b840-4" data-blocks='[["BL_840.4",840,[207,331,756,559]]]'>At approximately 6:20 p.m. a second motor vehicle accident occurred as vehicles were coming to a stop behind Jackson’s tractor-trailer. At mile post number 227.6, one-half mile from the initial accident, the tractor-trailer of Chester Ray Watley, Jr. (Watley)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>, struck the rear of a car operated by Mirita Shroff (Shroff) in the right-hand westbound lane of the highway. After impacting with Shroff’s vehicle, Watley’s tractor-trader jackknifed and came to rest against a guard rail at the north side of the right-hand berm.</p>

Trooper Nice set up flares across the westbound lanes of the highway and remained at the westbound exit ramp directing traffic until approximately 12:30 a.m. At approximately 7:20 p.m., two PPL employees, Carl Nevious and Bradley Smithgall, were at the scene of the first accident and attempted to remove the electrical wire from the road.</p>
    <p id="b840-6" data-blocks='[["BL_840.6",840,[202,1494,755,612]]]'>It was about 8:15 p.m. when the Lindows came to a stop near mile post number 228.1, one half mile from the second accident scene. Following the Lindows’ vehicle was the vehicle of Gerald A. Franz (Franz) along with his passenger, Taylor. A third motor vehicle accident occurred when Joseph J. Questore (Questore) drove his delivery truck <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> into the rear of the Franz vehicle, propelling it eighty-seven feet. Questore’s truck also struck, <em>inter alia, </em>the rear of the Lindows’ vehicle. Because of these collisions, Taylor and the Lindows suffered serious injuries.</p>

A separate action against the appellees was started by the Lindows in Northumberland County. The Taylor action was later transferred and consolidated with the Lindows action in Northumberland County. After extensive discovery, appellees along with the PSP filed motions for summary judgment in both cases. After briefing and oral argument, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment of appel-lees and the PSP.</p>

In this respect, the trial court concluded that in addition to the lack of casual connection, PPL did not breach any duty owed to Taylor or the Lindows because it removed the downed wire by 7:40 p.m. However, our review of the record reveals that Porter, the driver of the tractor-trailer on which the electrical wire landed, stated in her deposition that the electrical wire was not removed by the time of the third accident. (Deposition of Carol Porter, December 4, 1992 at 78). This evidence is in conflict with the deposition testimony of PPL employees who stated that the wire was removed by 7:40 p.m. Since it is not this court’s function to weigh the evidence and to determine the truth of the matter asserted, this issue should be properly left for the jury to decide. <em>Keenheel v.

This reliance is misplaced since that case involved the trees, <em>traffic controls, </em>and street lighting exception to governmental immunity at Section 8542(b)(4) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(4). In the instant case, Sharkey is attempting to come under Section 8522(b)(4) of the Judicial Code. The Commonwealth highway exception is a distinct and a separate exception from the trees, traffic controls, and street lighting exception to governmental immunity.</p>

Although our supreme court discussed the term “operation” with respect to Section 8542(b)(1) of the Judicial Code and not pursuant to the sovereign immunity exception at Section 8522(b)(1) of the Judicial Code, this is of no moment. Unlike Sharkey’s prior contention, the two exceptions are the same with the sole exception of the applicable party, namely, a governmental or commonwealth party. Thus, our reliance on <em>Love </em>is appropriate.</p>
