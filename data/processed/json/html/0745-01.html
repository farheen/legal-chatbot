According to their argument, Section 606(c) is not implicated at all because the challenged benefit is a retirement benefit, and Section 606(c) clearly applies solely to health insurance for supervisor-employees during their service or employment, and merely operates to exempt such health insurance from the requirement of auditor approval.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> This distinction between all other forms of compensation (governed by Section 606(a)) and insurance plans for supervisors while in office or employment (governed by Section 606(c)) is demonstrated, according to Appellants, by the legislature’s use of the prefatory phrase in Section 606(c): “[i]n addition to the compensation authorized under this section ... ”. Appellants assert that this language demonstrates that the legislature recognized that health insurance plans generally are a form of compensation requiring auditor approval in accord with Section 606(a), except where the insurance applies to supervisors “while in office or while in the employ of the township,” which, in accord with Section 606(c), does not require auditor approval. By enacting Section 606(c) and thereby removing group insurance benefits for supervisors while in office or in the employ of the Township from the general requirement of auditor approval for compensation contained in Section 606(a), Appellants assert that the legislature did not preclude a finding that post-retirement medical insur-<a id="p757" href="#p757" data-label="757" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*757</a>anee benefits are compensation subject to auditor approval within Section 606(a).</p>

In particular, when the Ordinance was passed on December 18, 1997, Mr. Napp was a thirty-year employee of the Township who would retire twelve days later; Mr. Caris was a thirty-one year employee who would retire two years later; and Mr. Hartranft was an employee two weeks short of his twenty-year anniversary date (and thus full “vesting” of his new-found post-retirement medical benefit right) who would retire six months later.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The provision of post-retirement medical benefits was simply not a term that the supervisors bargained for when they agreed to serve or that “attract[ed]” them to work for the Township. Thus, by passing the Ordinance on their way out of the door, the supervisors essentially were helping themselves to more than just the fruit of their own labors. In light of the foregoing, even if, after strictly construing the Second Class Township Act, I agreed with the Majority that the Act provides supervisors the power to grant themselves post-retirement medical benefits, I would not find that the supervisors <em>sub judice </em>strictly complied with such power.

The timing of the supervisors' decisions to grant themselves post-retirement medical benefits — and, in relatively quick succession, to begin earning them — is telling in another respect. Although the parties overlook the fact, by completing their service as supervisors two weeks after passing the Ordinance in December 1997, Messrs. Napp and Caris avoided the prospect of answering to their employers — the Township’s voters — in the next municipal election, and, although Mr. Hartranft remained in office for eighteen months after voting for the Ordinance, it appears that the same can be said for him. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 748 (noting that Mr. Hartranft was first elected in 1977 and served continuously thereafter); 53 P.S. § 65403(a) (providing for six-year terms for supervisors of second-class townships).
