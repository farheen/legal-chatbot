The issue we decide, <em>inter alia, </em>is whether, under a comparative negligence scheme, the plaintiffs contributory negligence must be a substantial or featherweight factor in causing his own injuries in order to reduce his recovery. We hold that the plaintiffs contributory negligence need be only a feather-weight causative factor. Because the trial court’s charge to the jury on the question of comparative negligence was prejudi-cially erroneous, we grant a new trial.</p>

Before the day of Bunting’s accident, the vessel had been experiencing an oil leak from a fitting on an Inert Gas System (“IGS”) generator. Attempts to repair the fitting failed, and a drip can was placed beneath the leak in order to keep the oil off the ship’s deck. Bunting himself had emptied and replaced this can on several occasions. At the time of the accident, Bunting was descending a ladder that led from the ship’s IGS deck to the engine room, when he slipped and fell, sustaining injury to his left knee. Upon returning to the area where he fell, Bunting discovered that the can beneath the leaking fitting had fallen over and oil had run onto the ladder steps.</p>

Defendants argued that Bunting was eontributorily negligent. After trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Bunting in the amount of $1,026,000 and in favor of his wife on her consortium claim in the amount of $31,000.</p>

In order to prove a claim of unseaworthiness under federal maritime law, a plaintiff must show that the unseaworthy condition of the vessel was the proximate, or direct, and substantial cause of his or her injuries. <em>See, e.g., Brophy v. Lavigne, </em><a href="/f2d/801/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="801 F.2d 521" data-case-ids="10546927" data-case-paths="/f2d/801/0521-01">801 F.2d 521</a>, 524 (1st Cir.1986). In this case, the trial court properly instructed the jury that, in order for liability to attach on the issue of unseaworthiness, the unseaworthy condition of the S.S. TROPIC SUN must have been a “substantial factor” in causing Bunting’s injuries, and this instruction was confirmed in the jury’s verdict sheet interrogatories. As is indicated by the jury’s answers to these interrogatories, they found the vessel to be unseaworthy, and the unseaworthiness to have been a substantial factor in causing Bunting’s injuries.</p>

However, because this case also involves allegations of negligence, and the defense of contributory negligence under the Jones Act, we must review the propriety of the court’s charge on this issue. Traditionally, cases of this nature are brought both under the unseaworthiness doctrine of federal maritime law and under the Jones Act. Recovery, if any, is against the defendant-shipowner without separate allocation of damages to either the unseaworthiness or Jones Act negligence theory. The instant case was brought under both theories. Our specific inquiry relates to comparative negligence under the Jones Act.</p>

Under the Jones Act, a plaintiff still may recover damages even if the jury finds him to have been up to 99% negligent.

Thus the purpose is to accord damages where the injuries are caused wholly from the negligence of the railroad or where caused partly by its negligence and partly by acts of others. The others would, of course, include the injured worker too. The object was to free this new legislatively created right of the common law defenses and refinements and to supply in its stead a simplified structure in which damages would be borne by railroad and injured worker in proportion to their respective faults. Use of the terms “in proportion to” and “negligence attributable to” the injured worker inescapably calls for a comparison. Since it is clear that § 53 never contemplates a reduction in damages for negligent acts of the injured worker except to the extent such negligence brings about the injuries, it is obvious that for a system of comparative fault to work, the basis of comparison has to be the same.</blockquote>

The law does this to encourage the shipowner to act responsibly in maintaining vessel conditions. In order to maintain these high standards aboard the ship it is necessary for personnel also to act with utmost care. Therefore, in situations requiring a comparison of negligence between the plaintiff and the defendant, the same causative standard must be imposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In the instant ease the trial court’s error may well have prejudiced the appellant-shipowners, since the jury did find that the plaintiff was negligent <em>to some degree. </em>Although they did not find this negligence to have been a “substantial factor” in causing the injury, they might have found that it “play[ed] any part, no matter how slight,” in causing it. If the jury had been instructed properly, and so found a causal connection between the plaintiff’s own conduct and his injury, the percentage of causal negligence they would have attributed to him would have reduced his damages award.

In his charge on Jones Act negligence, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that, in order to hold the defendant shipowner liable under the Jones Act, they must find that its negligence “played any part at all in causing the harm complained of.” R. 684a. However, the corresponding interrogatoiy on the jury verdict sheet required that the defendant’s negligence must have been a “substantial factor” in causing Bunting's injury in order for liability under the Jones Act to attach. This clearly was error. The verdict sheet language imposed upon the plaintiff a greater causal burden than is required by the law. Nevertheless, this error was not prejudicial. The jury found "substantial factor” causation, and therefore they certainly would have found that the "featherweight" causation requirement was satisfied. We need not grant a new trial based on this error in the charge. <em>See Richards v. Dravo Corp., </em><a href="/pa-super/249/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="249 Pa.
