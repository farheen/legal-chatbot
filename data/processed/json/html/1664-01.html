    <p id="b990-24" data-blocks='[["BL_990.24",990,[282,2289,1322,92]]]'>The board affirmed all the above rejections, and added the somewhat cryptic comment that:</p>

      <em>* </em>* * the necessity for citing so many references was in all probability brought about by uncertainty on the part of the Examiner as to how the claimed <a id="p1667" href="#p1667" data-label="1667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1667</a>compounds differed structurally from those shown in these references. This uncertainty was apparently engendered by the indefinite nature of the products, as claimed, and the further fact that appellants did not specifically compare the claimed products with the products of the reference patents under the same conditions.</blockquote>
    <p id="b991-4" data-blocks='[["BL_991.4",991,[166,497,1321,84]]]'>We note, however, that there was no rejection for failure to comply with 35 U.S.C. 112.</p>
    <p id="b991-5" data-blocks='[["BL_991.5",991,[167,599,1326,643]]]'>We have begun our consideration of the rejections in this case with a purely numerical analysis, and we have ended it there, for, as will become apparent, the existing situation does not permit rational isolation and determination of the legal issues which may be present. Regarding claim 1, the most reasonable interpretation of the board’s statement leads to the conclusion that there is, in fact, the astounding total of <em>twenty-four separate rejections </em>of the claim. As to claims 2 and 3, there is no meaningful way to tell how many rejections have been made, because of the board’s use of the disjunctive conjunction “and/or.” The number of rejections of claims 4, 5, 6 and 8 is likewise indefinite, due to the use of the word “any,” but the <em>minimum </em>number is eleven. A rejection so stated defeats the intent and purpose of 35 U.S.C. 132.</p>
    <p id="b991-6" data-blocks='[["BL_991.6",991,[167,1259,1324,550]]]'>The form of the rejections would seem to indicate that many of the references were considered merely cumulative. And yet, the examiner’s answer and the solicitor’s brief describe and analyze each reference in some detail. Such a state of affairs places this court in a, very real quandary. Are we to choose one individual rejection for each claim and turn the entire appeal on the correctness of those rejections? Or are we to work our way step-by-step through each rejection in the hope of finding one we can sustain? Neither alternative is satisfactory from the standpoint of the public interest. Issues must be framed in the Patent Office so that we can determine with certainty the areas of our authority under 35 U.S.C. 144.</p>
    <p id="b991-7" data-blocks='[["BL_991.7",991,[168,1816,1323,343]]]'>We decline to substitute speculation as to the rejection for the greater certainty which should come from the Patent Office in a more definite statement of the grounds of the rejections. To the extent the references are <em>truly </em>cumulative, the examiner or board can so indicate. If, on the other hand, all or most of the references are really necessary to meet the claims, the rejection can be made specific as to particular references.</p>
