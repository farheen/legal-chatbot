The rental agreement between Lester and Video Express required that the videotapes be returned within twenty-four hours. Lester claims that on November 25, 1989, she returned four of the rented videos and re-rented one, “The Serpent and the Rainbow.” Lester claims she returned “The Serpent and the Rainbow” the next day or the day after that. However, Video Express’ records do not reveal that the video was re-rented on November 25, 1989. Rather, their records indicate that the movie was due on November 25, 1989, and that on that date it began appearing on their “overdue films” list. Video Express telephoned Lester to request the return of the movie at which time Lester informed them that she had returned it. On December 15, 1989, Video Express sent a registered letter to Lester which stated that the video was overdue and asked for its return.</p>

On November 11, 1991, Lester was stopped for a routine traffic violation. The warrant appeared and Lester was arrested. Charges against Lester were later dismissed.</p>

Tilton; and the City of Reno, alleging, false imprisonment, false arrest, libel, malicious prosecution, and negligence. In September 1992, Lester settled with defendants Norman, Tilton and the City of Reno and the case was dismissed with prejudice as to these defendants. An amended complaint was filed on December 1, 1992, naming Ron Jahn, a co-owner and manager of Video Express at the time, as an additional defendant. Also in the amended complaint Lester abandoned her claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, and negligence. Video Express, Buchanen and Jahn (hereinafter referred to collectively as “Video Express”) filed a motion for summary judgment on December 8, 1992. On January 19, 1993, Lester stipulated to dismiss her libel claim with prejudice. Accordingly, Lester’s claim for malicious prosecution was the only claim remaining. Video Express’ motion for summary judgment was granted, and judgment for the defendants was entered on January 21, 1993. This appeal followed.</p>

At his deposition, the Deputy District Attorney in charge of prosecuting this matter testified that Video Express had no further involvement, beyond their initial police report, in the decision to institute criminal proceedings. Further, Lester testified that she does not have any evidence that Video Express did anything more than submit an initial statement to the Reno Police Department. Although the decision to issue an arrest warrant may seem rather extreme, it was the investigating police officer who requested the warrant, not Video Express.</p>

Now, it may be that Ms. Lester misplaced this one movie and did not return it as she claims to have done; or, it may be that the movie was misre-corded in the video store’s computerized record system. It really does not matter. Ms. Lester is not a criminal. If Ms. Lester is responsible for the cost of a lost or misplaced video tape, this is a matter that should be resolved in the civil courts, not the criminal courts. The frightening aspect of this case is that Video Express <a id="p1432" href="#p1432" data-label="1432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1432</a>was able, successfully, to use the police, the district attorney and the criminal process to enforce its civil claims.</p>

The record shows that it was the custom and practice of this business to pursue criminal actions in cases based entirely upon customers’ not returning video tapes after they received mail notice that the tapes were overdue. As a matter of practice, Video Express, in pursuing criminal actions against its video customers, did not give any consideration to the necessary elements of criminality set out in the statute (NRS 205.940(2)), namely, an “intent to defraud” or the criminal “intent to . . . retain possession of such property without the lessor’s permission.” If customers did not respond to their mail notice that a <a id="p1433" href="#p1433" data-label="1433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1433</a>video was not returned on time, they were turned over to the police without any consideration being given to the necessary elements of fraud or an unlawful intention to retain possession of Video Express’s property.

No information was provided to the police or to the district attorney concerning the <em>mens rea </em>of this crime, namely, that the customer was guilty of fraud or intentional retention of a video tape “without permission.” Bringing <a id="p1434" href="#p1434" data-label="1434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1434</a>criminal charges in this way, causing their delinquent renters to be arrested by the police, is on its face an arrest without probable cause. Under our law, malice is inferred from such misconduct. <em>See </em>Miller v.

      <p id="b614-8" data-blocks='[["BL_614.7",614,[207,1883,1118,484]]]'>The majority claims that “the record is devoid of any evidence” that the criminal prosecution was “commenced” at “the direction, request, or pressure of Video Express,” yet at the same time argues that Video Express “submitted the police report [that is to say, initiated criminal proceedings] in the good faith belief that [Ms. Lester] did not return the property.” What the majority overlooks is that it is not a crime “not to return the property” and that absent an intent to defraud or to retain possession unlawfully, no criminal proceedings could be properly brought against Ms. Lester. Ms. Lester’s testimony that she believed that Video Express preferred criminal charges against her “because they believed that the movie had not been returned” is immaterial. It is Video Express’s having Ms. Lester arrested merely because of the “belief” that she did not timely return a video tape that comprises the tortious conduct in this case.</p>
