    <p id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[175,365,747,376]]]'>The 1955-56 agreements are expressly made subject to an attached schedule of conditions and restrictions. By its terms the schedule applies to “ . . . the laying of all electric conduits, water, steam and gas pipes upon or in any of the State Highways or upon any portion thereof.” Clause 5 thereof provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b481-6" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[214,780,710,765]]]'>“Whenever it becomes necessary to relocate any pole or poles, pipes, conduits or other construction permitted, which interferes unreasonably with entrance to land abutting on said Highways, or interferes with changes of said Highways, the Chief Engineer of the Highway Department shall designate and approve new and suitable locations for such poles, pipes, conduits or other construction, and, upon reasonable notice from said Chief Engineer or his representative, the holder of the permit shall relocate such pole or poles, pipes, conduits or other construction, according to such designation, at its sole cost and expense.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b481-7" data-blocks='[["BL_481.6",481,[180,1582,747,765]]]'>The Court below correctly stated that “These agreements if applicable would clearly place the burden on Artesian to absorb all expenses for the relocation of its facilities from the areas over which the franchises were granted.” However the Court determined that due to the 1958-59 relocation, only 5% of the original right-of-way specifically encompassed by the franchise agreements was still being used by the plaintiff and therefore the agreements applied only to that portion. That is, Clause 5, supra, does not dispose of the relocation compensation issue as to the bulk of the relocated water pipe. We disagree with this conclusion.</p>

The general rule is that a contract remains in force until and unless it has been terminated according to its terms or by actions of the parties. 17A C.J.S., Contracts § 385(1). Clearly the contracts here did not expire by their own terms, a thirty-year period being specified therein. The actions of the parties indicate that both regarded the contracts as still controlling, most notably in that plaintiff continued to pay, and the defendant to accept, the precise per mile/per year franchise fee specified in the agreements. It would be absurd to attribute this to coincidence. It generally appears that until this relocation controversy arose, both parties regarded these agreements as the charter of their rights and duties in regard to the relocated right-of-way.</p>
    <p id="b481-12" data-blocks='[["BL_481.11",481,[978,1225,749,865]]]'>Courts of this State have long looked to relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the contract, including the actions of the parties, in ascertaining the intention of the parties. See Orenstein v. Kahn, Del.Supr., <a href="/del-ch/13/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="13 Del. Ch. 376" data-case-ids="1786151" data-case-paths="/del-ch/13/0376-01">13 Del.Ch. 376</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20444" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="119 A. 444">119 A. 444</a> (1922) and St. Regis Sales Corp. v.

Such actions are of great weight in determining the meaning and applicability of the contract, and lead the Court to a presumptively correct interpretation. See Morgan v.

We seek to determine if these contracts apply to this realigned right-of-way, noting the language therein does not expressly answer this <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>question.

Such a conclusion is, however, contrary to the intention of the parties as evidenced by their continuing payments and receipt thereof as delineated precisely in the parties’ last franchise agreement of 1956. Such conduct amounted to an acquiescence or af-firmance of the contract and gave it continuing validity, despite the fact that conditions may have warranted a rescission of the contract, an issue we need not concern ourselves with.
