Mr. McClintock was a passenger in the vehicle. Ms. Caldwell died due to injuries sustained in the accident. Appellants alleged that DOT failed to properly maintain the highway.

DOT argued that Appellants had not provided any evidence that could establish that a dangerous road condition caused the vehicle to leave the paved portion of the highway. As such, DOT alleged that it was immune from liability.

This Section provides that the Commonwealth can be held liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of its real estate, highways and sidewalks. However, the trial court, in reviewing case law, determined that immunity is only waived under this section where it was a dangerous condition of the Commonwealth highway that actually caused a person’s vehicle to leave the paved portion of the highway. As Appellants’ did not allege that a dangerous condition of the highway itself caused Ms. Caldwell’s vehicle to exit the paved portion of the road, the trial court found that the real estate exception to sovereign immunity did not apply. As such, the trial court granted DOT’S motion for summary judgment. Appellants thereafter filed a notice of appeal with the trial court.</p>
