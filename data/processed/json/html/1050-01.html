Gershel (Claimant) was not ineligible for unemployment compensation (UC) benefits under Sections 402(h) and <em>4(l</em>)(2)(B) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> SkyHawke argues that the Board erred as a matter of law in finding Claimant eligible for UC benefits because Claimant was not an employee, but a self-employed, independent contractor and, therefore, ineligible for UC benefits. For the following reasons, we reverse the Order of the Board.</p>
    <p id="b1089-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1089.14",1089,[971,410,751,1168]]]'>Claimant was employed by SkyHawke to perform global positioning satellite (GPS) mapping of golf courses from June 2009 until December 2, 2009. Claimant applied for UC benefits effective December 27, 2009, asserting a lack of work and naming GBI, Inc. (GBI), his former employer, as his employer. (Initial Internet Claim at 1-2, December 30, 2009, R.R. at la-2a; Referee’s Determination, Findings of Fact (FOF) ¶ 1.) The Harrisburg UC Service Center (Service Center) found Claimant eligible for benefits, but concluded that SkyHawke, not GBI, was Claimant’s employer. (Notice of Determination at 1, R.R. at 12a.) SkyHawke appealed and the matter was assigned to the Referee, who held a hearing at which Claimant and Sky-Hawke presented evidence. Claimant testified on his own behalf and SkyHawke offered the testimony of Chris Moulds, its manager of the quality control and course mapping department.</p>

However, the Referee explained that the issue of which employer was financially liable was not before him because Claimant’s claim was based on the first four of the last five completed quarters and that was an issue different than the one before him, whether Claimant was eligible for UC benefits. (Hr’g Tr. at 25, R.R. at 45a.) Claimant testified that SkyHawke paid <a id="p1052" href="#p1052" data-label="1052" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1052</a>him a flat rate based on whether he mapped a nine-hole or eighteen-hole golf course. (Hr’g Tr. at 24, R.R. at 44a; SkyHawke’s Exh. 9-9c, R.R. at 67a-71a.) Claimant acknowledged that his work was not supervised in any way, he had no reporting times or deadlines, and he understood that he was an independent contractor and not an employee of SkyHawke. (Hr’g Tr. at 25, 27, R.R. at 45a, 47a.) Indeed, Claimant agreed that SkyHawke “would not exercise control over [Claimant’s] activities or business operation.” (Hr’g Tr. at 27, R.R. at 47a.)</p>

(Hr’g Tr. at 14, 16, R.R. at 34a, 36a; FOF ¶ 11.) He stated that Sky-Hawke did not control Claimant’s day-today activities or supervise Claimant while he mapped golf courses, and SkyHawke communicated with Claimant approximately twice per month. (Hr’g Tr. at 13, R.R. at 33a.) Mr. Moulds indicated that Claimant was free to accept or reject any assignment. (Hr’g Tr. at 12, R.R. at 32a; FOF ¶ 12.) According to Mr. Moulds, Sky-Hawke provided Claimant with proprietary software and equipment, which was licensed to SkyHawke, to map the golf courses and a brief training session in Pennsylvania<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> with another SkyHawke mapper on how to use the equipment. (Hr’g Tr. at 20-22, R.R. at 40a-42a; FOF ¶¶ 8-10.) With regard to the cessation of Claimant’s work in December 2009, Mr. Moulds testified that it was impractical to map golf courses during the winter months because GPS targets are not visible when there is snow on the ground, and many golf courses close and will not allow people on the golf course. (Hr’g Tr. at 12, R.R. at 32a.) Finally, Mr. Moulds indicated that, if Claimant’s mapping did not meet SkyHawke’s quality standards, Claimant was required to re-map the golf course in order to be paid for that particular course.

(Hr’g Tr. at 4-5, SkyHawke Exh. 3 (Agreement) ¶¶ 5-6, R.R at 24a-25a, 57a; FOF ¶ 5.) The Agreement indicated that SkyHawke would not provide Claimant with health insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, paid vacation, office space, or secretarial support. (Agreement ¶ 6, R.R. at 57a.) The Agreement did include a non-compete agreement whereby, in the event of his separation from employment, Claimant agreed not to engage or compete in “any business relating to the GPS En-ablement of golf courses, golf course GPS equipment, or offer[] products and services similar to [SkyHawke’s] products” for one year after termination of the Agreement. (Agreement ¶ 10, R.R. at 58a; FOF ¶¶ 5-6.) The Agreement also contained a trade secret and confidentiality agreement regarding SkyHawke’s proprietary software. (Agreement at Exhibit A, R.R. at 61a-62a; FOF ¶7.) Additionally, the Agreement included a Third Party Services provision through which Sky-Hawke retained the right to modify or terminate the Agreement if SkyHawke determined, in its sole discretion, that Claimant’s provision of services to other parties in the golf industry was not in SkyHawke’s <a id="p1053" href="#p1053" data-label="1053" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1053</a>best interests or would pose an actual or potential conflict with SkyHawke’s interests. (Agreement ¶ IB, R.R. at 59a.) Claimant indicated at the hearing that he understood this particular clause to mean that he could not perform work for any other golf GPS companies. (Hr’g Tr. at 24, R.R. at 44a.)</p>
    <p id="b1091-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1091.4",1091,[162,743,755,1085]]]'>Based upon this evidence, the Referee concluded that Claimant was SkyHawke’s employee because SkyHawke: “determined the amount of remuneration to be paid”; “provided the required equipment ... to perform the duties”; trained Claimant on how to use SkyHawke’s equipment; required Claimant to re-do his work if SkyHawke found it lacking; and made Claimant sign confidentiality and non-compete agreements, thereby precluding Claimant from performing this type of work for competing companies. (Referee Decision at 2.) The Referee further noted that Claimant had no proprietary interest in SkyHawke. (FOF ¶ 3.) SkyHawke appealed to the Board, which affirmed the Referee’s decision and adopted the Referee’s findings and conclusions as its own. SkyHawke now petitions this Court for review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

SkyHawke contends that it overcame the presumption that Claimant was its employee by establishing, as required by Section 4(i )(2)(B) of the Law, that Claimant: (1) was free from SkyHawke’s control or direction; and (2) was involved in an independently established business. 43 P.S. § 753(Z )(2)(B).</p>
    <p id="b1091-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1091.9",1091,[961,446,751,1300]]]'>Section 402(h) of the Law states that “[a]n employe shall be ineligible for compensation for any week ... [i]n which he is engaged in self-employment.” 43 P.S. § 802(h). Generally, there is a presumption in the Law that an individual receiving wages is an employee and not an independent contractor engaged in self-employment. <em>Electrolux Corporation v.

However, an employer can overcome this presumption by establishing that a claimant is self-employed. <em><a href="/a2d/705/1357-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="705 A.2d 1357" data-case-ids="11879062" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/1357-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/705/1357-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="705 A.2d 1357" data-case-ids="11879062" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/1357-01">at 1360</a>. Although the Law does not define “self-employment,” our courts utilize Section 4(Z )(2)(B) of the Law “to fill the void because its obvious purpose is to exclude independent contractors from coverage.” <em>Beacon Flag Car Company, Inc.

Thus, pursuant to this section, an employer establishes that a claimant is self-employed by proving that the claimant was: (1) free from control and direction in the performance of his service; and (2) customarily engaged in an independent trade or business as to that service. <em>Beacon Flag, </em><a href="/a2d/910/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="910 A.2d 103" data-case-ids="8445642" data-case-paths="/a2d/910/0103-01">910 A.2d at 107</a>.

That Claimant did not own the specialized GPS equipment required to perform the work, (Hr’g Tr. at 23-24, R.R. at 43a-44a), is not fatal to the “control prong” and is not a necessary part of the standard established by this Court. <em>Viktor, </em><a href="/pa/586/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="586 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="5653587" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0196-01">586 Pa. at 217</a>, <a href="/pa/586/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="892 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="5653587,8988703" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0196-01,/a2d/892/0781-01">892 A.2d at 794</a>.

SkyHawke responds that “Claimant was free to provide GPS mapping services to the public[,] and was merely restricted from providing GPS mapping services of golf course[s]” to <em>other golf companies, companies competing with SkyHawke, or those providing services similar to SkyHawke’s end product. </em>(SkyHawke’s Br. at 21; Hr’g Tr. at 15, R.R. at 35a.)

Moreover, although the relevant provisions of the Agreement limited Claimant’s ability to work for other entities, those limitations were related to the particular area of services, i.e., GPS mapping of golf courses. Claimant was still able to perform GPS mapping services for the public or companies, so long as that work did not relate to golf course mapping. Additionally, the Third Party Services part of the Agreement clearly recognized that Claimant could perform work elsewhere in the golf industry, but provided SkyHawke the ability to review that work to determine whether it conflicted with the services Claimant provided for SkyHawke. Finally, the fact that Claimant remains able to perform GPS mapping services for those other than SkyHawke’s competitors and perform other services in the golf industry that do not infringe upon Sky-Hawke’s business supports the conclusion that the nature of Claimant’s business does not require him to look only to one employer to provide his services. Therefore, based on our consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the circumstances here support the conclusion that Claimant was engaged in an independent trade or business and outweigh the contrary evidence, such as the non-compete clause and Third Party Services Agreement.
