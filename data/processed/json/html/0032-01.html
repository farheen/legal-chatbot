    <p id="b63-10" data-blocks='[["BL_63.11",63,[107,1787,754,715]]]'>Moss, an inmate confined at the State Correctional Institution at Greene, was found guilty, at institutional misconduct no. 394619, of flushing the commode and running the water in his sink to cause the flooding of his cell, the restricted housing unit, and surrounding offices while he was confined at SCI Retreat in November 2002. After final review sustaining the charges against Moss, the Department of Corrections served on Moss a notice of assessment for misconduct, reflecting the facility maintenance manager’s report of $5,119.60 in estimated damages.</p>
    <p id="b63-14" data-blocks='[["BL_63.14",63,[906,270,757,1234]]]'>At an assessment hearing conducted on February 4, 2003, at which the facility business manager presented a breakdown of the $3,509.60 in labor costs for the clean up and repair of the restricted housing unit and surrounding offices. She testified that material costs were estimated to be $1,570. Corrections officers Smith, Gibbons, and Laeina testified that the notice of assessment was served on Moss on February 3, 2003 and that he signed the notice. Based on the credited testimony of the business manager, the hearing examiner found Moss responsible for $3,509.60 in labor expenses. The hearing examiner rejected Moss’s contentions that the costs should not be accepted as factual and that the staff who performed the clean up and repair work were already on the state payroll. The hearing examiner did not charge Moss with the cost of repair materials because the business manager did not present an itemized breakdown. The chief hearing examiner denied Moss’s appeal.</p>

Lehman, </em><a href="/a2d/671/1179-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="671 A.2d 1179" data-case-ids="7868585" data-case-paths="/a2d/671/1179-01">671 A.2d 1179</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1996). On appeal, Moss argues that he was denied due process, that the assessment was based on hearsay evidence, and that the Department of Corrections failed to meet its burden of proving the amount of expenses it incurred as a result of the misconduct. Our review is limited to determining whether necessary findings of fact are supported by the requisite evidence and whether constitutional rights have been vi-<a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>dated or errors of law have been committed. 2 Pa.C.S. § 704.</p>

At the hearing, Moss was given an opportunity to be heard and to ask questions, the hearing was transcribed and video taped, and the adjudication was in writing and contained the hearing examiners findings, credibility determinations, and reasoning. The hearing examiner gave adequate reasons for refusing to permit Moss to submit documentary evidence (i.e., irrelevant to the assessment) and to call witnesses. Due process in the prison disciplinary context does not require confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses. <em><a href="/us/418/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="418 U.S. 539" data-case-ids="6173832" data-case-paths="/us/418/0539-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/418/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="418 U.S. 539" data-case-ids="6173832" data-case-paths="/us/418/0539-01">at 567</a>, <a href="/us/418/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="418 U.S. 539" data-case-ids="6173832" data-case-paths="/us/418/0539-01">94 S.Ct. 2963</a>.</p>

As noted by the Department of Corrections in its brief, Moss did not object to any of this testimony and has therefore waived all objections to these labor costs. Moss did object to the business manager’s estimate of material costs, and the hearing examiner agreed that the Department of Corrections did not meet its burden with respect to that portion of the total costs and did not assess the cost of materials against Moss.</p>
