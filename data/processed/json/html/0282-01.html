The amount represented the policy limit of Skaling’s uninsured motorist policy with Aetna Insurance Company (Aetna). Skaling appealed the judgment, arguing that interest should have been added in accordance with G.L.1956 § 9-21-10 and G.L.1956 § 27-7-2.2, and that such interest should be calculated on the entire $1,174,500 awarded by the jury. Aetna also appealed on three grounds; namely, there was insufficient evidence that the use of a vehicle led to Skaling’s injuries, the trial justice committed reversible error when he permitted Skaling to present evidence at trial of two commendations that he had received from community groups, and the trial justice erroneously gave a sudden emergency instruction to the jury. For the reasons we shall discuss below, Aetna’s appeal is denied, and Skal-ing’s appeal is denied in part and sustained in part.</p>

    <p id="b331-16" data-blocks='[["BL_331.16",331,[1010,1547,756,439]]]'>At approximately 8:30 on the dark, rainy, and windy night of October 20, 1995, Shaun Menard (Menard) and Marty Web-ber (Webber) went for a ride in Menard’s Jeep. They drove to a hiking trail in western Coventry, Rhode Island, near the Connecticut border to go “four wheeling” on the trail, although state regulations prohibit motorized vehicles on hiking trails.</p>
    <p id="b331-17" data-blocks='[["BL_331.17",331,[1010,2011,756,629]]]'>After driving on the trail a short distance, Menard and Webber came to an abandoned wooden railroad trestle bridge that crossed sixty to seventy feet above the Moosup River. A six-foot-high chain link fence ran along each side of the bridge. Although large boulders had been placed at both ends of the bridge to prevent vehicles from gaining access, Menard drove his Jeep through the woods, around the boulders, and onto the trestle. When he arrived at the other end of the bridge, the vehicle became stuck.</p>

Certain facts about the Jeep are undisputed, however. The Jeep was approximately seventy inches wide, the bridge was eighty-six inches wide, and the Jeep was stopped at an angle, with its lights turned off. The chain link fence near the front driver’s side of the Jeep was on the ground underneath the Jeep; the Jeep could move neither forward nor backward.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[184,866,754,632]]]'>When the Jeep became stuck, Menard and Webber exited the vehicle, climbed down the bank of the river, and spent some time drinking beer and “partying” on the shores of the Moosup. After each had drunk about six beers, the pair climbed back up the bank and walked onto the bridge. Webber tried to walk past the driver’s side of the Jeep but fell off the bridge when he came to the place where a section of fence had been torn down. After Menard realized that Webber had fallen, he left to find help.</p>

Skaling was at home with his wife and children, and estimated that between 9:15 and 11:30 that night he had four or five beers, as well as a nightcap. At approximately 11:45, Menard arrived at Skaling’s door, told Mrs. Skaling that his friend had fallen off the bridge, asked her to call 911, and immediately ran back to Webber. Skaling put on his boots and a sweatshirt, grabbed a blanket, and drove his truck to the edge of the bridge. He left his truck lights on and began walking across the bridge, calling out in an effort to find Webber or Menard. As he attempted to pass the Jeep, he found himself “edging along * * * with [his] belly up to the vehicle as close as you can possibly get to something.” As he reached the driver’s door in the area where the fence was down, he fell off the bridge. As Skal-ing fell, he struck the granite stones that provided support for the bridge and then continued to fall to the ground below. Skaling was severely injured in the fall and was hospitalized for two months.</p>

Menard’s automobile liability insurer paid Skaling its policy limit of $25,000 in settlement of that claim. Skaling also sought compensation from Aetna, pursuant to the uninsured/un-derinsured motorist (UM) provisions of his own automobile insurance policy. Aetna asserted that Skaling’s injuries were not a covered claim because they did not arise from Menard’s ownership, maintenance, or use of his Jeep, and Aetna refused Skal-ing’s offer to arbitrate the issue.</p>

A jury returned a verdict, finding that Skaling’s injuries were proximately caused by Me-nard’s negligence, and awarded Skaling, his wife, and two children $1,174,500 in damages. The jury reduced its original damage award of $1,305,000 by 10 percent, based on its determination that Skaling’s own negligence was a contributing proxi<a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>mate cause of his injuries.

After the entry of judgment, Aetna filed a motion for a new trial, pursuant to Rule 59(a) of the Superi- or Court Rules of Civil Procedure, on the grounds that the trial justice committed prejudicial error in permitting the admission into evidence of two commendations for heroism that Skaling received and in charging the jury with a “sudden emergency” instruction.

Skaling has argued that under Rule 50(b), a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of evidence must be renewed within ten days of the entry of judgment in order for the issue to be preserved for appeal. Rule 50(b) provides that when a motion for judgment as a matter of law is made at the close of all evidence and is denied, “[s]uch a motion may be renewed by service and filing not later than 10 days after entry of judgment.” The corresponding federal rule has long been interpreted to <em>require </em>renewal of the motion after judgment is entered in order to preserve an issue for appeal. <em>Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., </em><a href="/us/330/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 U.S. 212" data-case-ids="354136" data-case-paths="/us/330/0212-01">330 U.S. 212</a>, 218, <a href="/us/330/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="330 U.S. 212" data-case-ids="354136" data-case-paths="/us/330/0212-01">67 S.Ct. 752</a>, 756, <a href="/us/330/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="330 U.S. 212" data-case-ids="354136" data-case-paths="/us/330/0212-01">91 L.Ed. 849</a>, 853-54 (1947). After careful consideration, we have concluded that we shall not apply this interpretation to the Rhode Island rule. Instead, we hold that if a motion for judgment as a matter of law was made at the close of all evidence, the motion is sufficiently preserved for review by this Court. This holding in no way modifies our established rule that if one party makes a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the opponent’s case and then presents evidence on his or her own behalf, the motion must be renewed at the close of all evidence. If the motion was not so renewed, the earlier motion is deemed waived and may not be reviewed. <em>Hamrick v.

Regardless of its exact position, the vehicle occupied almost the entire width of the bridge, and anyone who attempted to cross was forced to walk at the very edge of the bridge. Skaling’s injuries did not occur in a vacuum. Webber fell off the bridge while trying to maneuver past the vehicle on the driver’s side. In fact, one of the firefighters who responded to Mrs. Skaling’s 911 call lost his footing at the same spot and avoided falling only because he had reached into the Jeep to hold on to its steering wheel. Another firefighter testified that she had to exercise care in passing the Jeep because “it was narrow, it was tight, it was slippery.” This evidence in our view was sufficient to support the jury’s determination that but for the negligent driving of the vehicle on the bridge, Skaling would not have been forced to walk at the edge of the bridge and would have avoided being injured. <em>See Verity v.

We agree with Aetna that the evidence here does not support a sudden emergency instruction. Skaling was not confronted with a situation in which he had to make a split-second or instinctive decision. He had time to consider what course of action to take, as evidenced by his testimony that he decided to bring a blanket on his rescue attempt because he knew that a blanket could be useful in treating shock. This situation, therefore, could not be categorized as a sudden emergency.</p>

Two observations support our conclusion that the sudden emergency instruction did not prejudice Aetna. First, based on all the evidence in the case, we are led to conclude that in the absence of the instruction, the jury would not have awarded Skaling less than $300,000 in damages. The purpose of the sudden emergency instruction in this case was to guide the jury in its evaluation of Skaling’s contributory negligence. The jury did attribute 10 percent of Skaling’s damages to his own negligence and, consistent with that finding, reduced its award of $1,305,000 to $1,174,-500. This reduction had no effect on Aetna’s liability because the damage award was still far in excess of the $300,000 limit of the insurer’s liability. It would have been necessary for the jury to determine that Skaling’s own negligence proximately caused 77 percent of his damages before the award would have been reduced below the liability cap of the UM policy. In fight of the evidence, therefore, it is our conclusion that the absence of the erroneous instruction would not have resulted in the jury’s finding that Menard’s undisputed negligence caused no more than 23 percent of Skafing’s damages.</p>

Here, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that Menard’s negligence in driving the Jeep onto the bridge was the proximate cause of Webber’s injury and that Skaling was engaged in a non-reckless attempt to rescue Webber. If the trial justice had charged the jury accordingly, he would not have instructed jurors on contributory negligence — save if they found Skaling’s conduct was reckless — and the damages awarded by the jury would not have been reduced. Skaling neither appealed the trial justice’s instruction to the jury on contributory negligence nor did he challenge the absence of an instruction on the rescue doctrine.

The language of § 27-7-2.2 is neither complex nor ambiguous, and construing its language strictly does not produce a result that is absurd or unreasonable. On its face, the statute reflects the Legislature’s intent to encourage insurance companies to settle when insureds are hable to other parties for torts committed by the insureds. The statute postdated decisions of this Court, discussed <em>post, </em>which held that under the prejudgment interest statute, § 9-21-10, victims of insured tortfeasors could not collect prejudgment interest from the insurer that would result in payments that exceeded policy limits. In contrast, Skal-ing’s claim here is that Aetna is liable to him for its own breach of contract.

The condition occurred when Menard’s negligence caused Skaling’s injury, and Aetna breached its contract by refusing to cover the damages within the contractual limits. Aetna’s liability also could have been limited to the contract limits and it could have avoided breach if it had agreed to Skaling’s demand to arbitrate the dispute, even though the insurance contract did not require arbitration of disputes over UM coverage.
