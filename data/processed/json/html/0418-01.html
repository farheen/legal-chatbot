After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, and after hearing their counsel in oral argument, the court is of the opinion that cause has not been shown and the issues should be decided at this time.</p>

General Laws 1956 (1994 Reenactment) § 31-27-2. The only issue raised on appeal is whether the state complied with the requirements of the motor vehicle statute in mailing defendant the results of his breathalyzer test. The defendant claims that the trial justice erred in admitting his breathalyzer test results into evidence because the copy of the results had not been sent to him by certified mail. The state presented evidence at trial that the results had been sent to the defendant by ordinary mail.</p>

It does not apply to the procedural requirements for the admissibility of breathalyzer test results in a criminal prosecution. Section 31-27-2, on the other hand, is a criminal statute, entitled “Motor Vehicle Offenses,” and § 31-27-2(c) specifically details the conditions that must be met before breathalyzer results may be admissible. This section requires that a copy of the test results be mailed within seventy-two (72) hours of the taking of the test to the person submitting to the test. Nowhere in § 31-27-2(c)(2) is it stated that the results must be sent by registered or certified mail. Had the legislature intended that breathalyzer results be sent by registered or certified mail, presumably it would have so stated in § 31-27-<a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>2(e)(2). Since it did not, the police officers’ use of regular mail did not bar the admissibility of the test results.</p>
