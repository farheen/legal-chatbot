    <p id="b398-18" data-blocks='[["BL_398.18",398,[982,1525,754,832]]]'>On January 26, 2000, the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board suspended respondent, Robert B. Patterson, for ninety days after he admitted that he practiced law after his license was suspended for failure to pay dues and that he dishonestly told a judge before whom he was appearing that he was unaware that his license had been suspended. After learning of respondent’s discipline, we temporarily suspended respondent on June 13, 2000, pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, § 11(d), and referred the matter to the Board on Professional Responsibility (“Board”). The Board recommends that we impose identical reciprocal discipline.</p>
