    <p id="b1253-21" data-blocks='[["BL_1253.20",1253,[956,1325,755,812]]]'>The referee made the following findings of fact. On January 26,1989, while performing his work duties as a meter reader for Employer, Claimant was accosted by a large attack dog that tried to bite Claimant, who managed to spray the dog with a chemical repellant provided by Employer. The dog’s owner confronted Claimant, threatened physical harm, and threatened to take Claimant’s life. The man then entered his house, reappeared with a gun, and chased Claimant along back alleys. In Claimant’s frantic attempt to escape, he had to jump a fence and began pounding on peoples’ doors. One woman finally opened her door for Claimant, who entered and instructed her to lie on the floor until the man had passed.</p>

Stein testified that Claimant was upset, agitated, and speaking rapidly at the time. Stein later came to the area and accompanied Claimant as he conducted further meter readings the rest of the day. Although Claimant finished his duties that day, he became fearful of being killed and began having heart palpitations, headaches, and difficulty breathing. Although Claimant returned to work the next day and was as<a id="p1188" href="#p1188" data-label="1188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1188</a>signed to work in a different area, he was unable to complete his duties because of headache, difficulty breathing, and hot and cold sweats. On January 30, 1989, Claimant telephoned Stein and advised that he would not be returning to work. Claimant thereafter came under the care of his family physician, Dr. Frank Berstein.</p>

In support of his petition, Claimant submitted the deposition testimony of Dr. David Levinberg, a board-certified psychiatrist, who testified that Claimant first came under his care on March 2,1989 on referral from Dr. Berstein; Claimant suffered from anxiety, weight loss, and an inability to concentrate; and Claimant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder due to his life-threatening event. Dr. Levin-berg opined that Claimant could not return to his pre-injury position as a meter reader because the memories would provoke an exacerbation of his symptoms and would cause a relapse. Claimant also presented the deposition testimony of Michael J. Mulligan, a clinical psychologist, who testified that he examined Claimant on February 24, 1989 on behalf of Employer and found that Claimant was suffering from post-traumatic stress response and was unfit for duty.</p>

Employer also presented the testimony of a private investigator who conducted surveillance of Claimant. The referee found that the testimony of Employer’s witnesses contradicted neither Claimant’s testimony nor that of his medical experts, and that the testimony presented by Employer was unpersuasive in contesting Claimant’s petition. Finding the testimony of Claimant’s expert witnesses credible and persuasive, the referee concluded that Claimant sustained a post-traumatic stress disorder from abnormal working conditions while performing his work duties on January 26, 1989, and that</p>

The referee in <em>Archer </em>granted the claimant’s petition for a work-related psychiatric disability based on claimant’s medical expert testimony and her own testimony of harassment and mistreatment by her employer, which rose to the level of abnormal working conditions.
