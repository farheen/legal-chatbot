The ends of the tubular members are covered by plain cylindrical caps, and upon each of the straps midway between the two said members there is what appears to be the .head of a bolt, much larger than necessary for any useful purpose.</p>
    <p id="b433-8" data-blocks='[["BL_433.9",433,[97,857,1319,243]]]'>The application was rejected by the three tribunals of the Patent Office, viz, the examiner, the board of examiners in chief, and the commissioner, as lacking in invention. In view of this fact, appellant must make out a clear case of error to obtain a reversal. <em>In re </em>Beswick, <a href="/app-dc/16/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 App. D.C. 345" data-case-ids="1312342" data-case-paths="/app-dc/16/0345-01">16 App. D.

    <p id="b433-9" data-blocks='[["BL_433.10",433,[98,1107,1320,344]]]'>The design patent to Hurlbut shows an automobile bumper comprising two cylindrical or tubular members connected in spaced relation by connecting members. They are apparently spaced nearer together than in appellant’s design, and the connections shown by Hurlbut are of curved metal while appellant’s connecting members are of flat metal. The Hurlbut design is of a front bumper extending the entire width of the car.</p>

There must be in addition an exercise of the inventive or original faculty. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Whitman Saddle </em>Co., <a href="/citations/?q=148%20U.S.%20678" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="148 U.S. 678">148 U.

The decorative arts would be retarded instead of advanced if one without the exercise of the inventive faculty, upon seeing a new article come into common use, could draft designs covering all attractive forms-of the article and secure patents for them, thus preventing the use of the article by the public, except in its most unattractive form,, unless tribute be paid to him who had secured the patents;</p>
