This case arises from a fatal airplane accident that occurred in 1999, when a thirty-one-year-old Piper PA-32-260 airplane crashed. Several people were killed, and another suffered serious injuries. Ap-pellees, who were the plaintiffs in the trial court, initiated suit against Appellants and others, and the actions were consolidated in the common pleas court in 2001.</p>

Appellees alleged that the crash was caused by a failure of engine and fuel system components that were replaced and overhauled within eighteen years of the date of the accident. Additionally, Appel-lees claimed that Appellants had knowledge of the alleged defects and engaged in intentional misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding relative to these defects. These sets of allegations were included to implicate exceptions to the 18-year statute of repose included in the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and its rolling provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Under GARA, claims for death, injury, and property damage involving certain types of aircraft asserted against a manufacturer are generally barred if the accident occurred more than 18 years after delivery of the aircraft to the first purchaser. The rolling provision preserves causes of action against manufacturers related to potentially defective replacement parts after 18 years, but it instructs that the 18-year time-period begins to run from the date of installation of the replacement part. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040101" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 40101">49 U.S.C.A. § 40101</a>, Note.</p>

Appellants timely appealed from the interlocutory order. Appellants’ argued that they were entitled to appellate review of the denial of summary judgment under the collateral order doctrine, as set forth in Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 313. <em>See </em>Pa. R.A.P. 313(b) (“A collateral order is an order separable from and collateral to the main cause of action where the right involved is too important to be denied review and the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claim will be irreparably lost.”).</p>

Appellants then sought review in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and were granted allowance of appeal. As noted by the Supreme Court, Appellants acknowledged in the earlier appeal that the United States Supreme Court has found some summary judgment orders will not fit within the collateral order doctrine, where they merely reflect the trial court’s determination that material facts are in issue concerning immunity, as opposed to the resolution of one or more dispositive legal questions. <em>Pridgen v.

In that initial appeal to our Supreme Court, Appellants argued, however, that the issue was not simply a challenge to the common pleas court’s judgment that material facts are in issue with regard to GARA’s applicability. Rather, Appellants claimed that they sought to challenge the legal standard employed by the common pleas court in determining which entities may be subject to GARA’s rolling provision relative to replacement parts. <em>Pridgen v.

Nor is it necessary to assess the actual age of the replacement parts alleged to have caused the accident for purposes of GARA. In this regard, the question of whether or not the replacement parts were actually installed within a new eighteen-year period implicated by the rolling provision is immaterial if Appellants are correct that no new period arises under the rolling provision in the first instance in relation to entities who are not the actual manufacturers of the relevant replacement components.[ ] Appellants’ framing of the central question presented therefore is consistent with an appropriate application of the collateral order doctrine under the United States Supreme Court’s distinction between summary judgment orders reflecting legal versus factual determinations, <em>see Johnson v.

That claim is unavailing. Here, the trial court reviewed the pleadings and the evidence, and it determined that there is a question of fact with respect to whether Appellants intentionally withheld required information from the FAA that is causally related to the harm suffered by Appellees. Trial Court Opinion, 5/15/08, at 5. Because the trial court’s determination is supported by the record, we conclude that the question of whether Appellants actually misrepresented or fraudulently withheld information was properly presented, was supported by the record, and ultimately presents a question of fact.
