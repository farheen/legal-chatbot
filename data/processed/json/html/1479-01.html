After such exposure the coating is contacted with electrostatic marking particles in the dark. These particles adhere to the areas where the electrostatic charges remain forming a powder image corresponding to the electrostatic image. The powder image can then be transferred to a sheet of transfer material resulting in a positive or negative print, as the case may be, having excellent detail and quality.

This matter was emphasized in appellants’ Request for Reconsideration by the board.</p>
    <p id="b811-6" data-blocks='[["BL_811.6",811,[108,1214,1325,496]]]'>The solicitor responds by pointing to the amendment of March 14, 1955, filed by appellants in the linking application more than two years prior to the filing of the application on appeal, citing language from the section entitled “Remarks” that “The claims have been amended and, as now drawn, clearly specify that the material is a phosphor.” The solicitor argues that this amendment would seem to make it clear that appellants did not intend to claim or disclose materials other than phosphors and can, therefore, claim no benefit “from the failure of any examiner to raise the insufficiency of the disclosure” in the linking application.</p>
    <p id="b811-7" data-blocks='[["BL_811.7",811,[105,1717,1327,543]]]'>The record, however, supports the argument of appellants that the claims “limited to specifically named chemical compounds” remained in the application after the amendment, not limited to the phosphor subgenus of such compounds, whereas other claims specifying like compounds were so limited. Examination of claims 16, 17 and 19 discloses each to be generic, respectively, to all zinc sulfide, zinc oxide and cadmium sulfide binder plates and while amended they were not limited to the phosphor subgenus. Claim 15 which specified binder plates fabricated from a group of materials including zinc sulfide, zinc oxide and cadmium sulfide, was amended by the insertion of a limitation to the phosphor subgenus of such materials.</p>

The course thus pursued affords relevant and cogent proof in negation of the solicitor’s argument that appellants seem to have made it clear that they did not intend to claim or disclose materials other than phosphors. It is a circumstance, at least, worthy of note and of some significance that no examiner at any time prior to the examiner’s answer filed in the pending appeal ever suggested .that the disclosure of the linking application was limited to phosphors.</p>

However, the board found that appellants’ affidavits under Rule 131 would “overcome the filing date of Greig in the absence of a statutory bar.” Having found support in the linking application it follows that Greig is not available as a reference against the claims.</p>

The application from which the Middleton patent issued was copending with the linking application of Middleton and Reynolds. The affidavits of Steinhilper and Mase were filed to show that the linking application was filed in the joint names of Middleton and Reynolds in September 1952, after the realization in the summer of 1952 that the generic invention of photo-conductive binder plates was their joint invention, rather than Middleton’s alone.</p>

He also urges that the examiner was correct in taking the position that the disclosure of only a single species, zinc titanate, in the Middleton patent does.not support the instant generic claims. However, these issues raised by the solicitor need not be decided in this case because Middleton et al. do not need to obtain the benefit of the filing date of the Middleton patent. As noted, the Greig patent, the only reference relied on besides the Middleton patent, is unavailable against the appealed claims because of the Rule 131 affidavit. Appellants thus do not need to establish a date of invention against some other person or a reference of some other person in order to prevail. They need only establish that the Middleton patent is not a proper reference against them.</p>

There seems to be no dispute that upon discovery of the fact of joint inventorship of the subject matter now claimed in the summer of 1952, the linking application was filed on September 25, 1952. In any event, we think the affidavits of Middleton and Reynolds clearly establish that zinc titanate was their joint invention and not that of Middleton alone.
