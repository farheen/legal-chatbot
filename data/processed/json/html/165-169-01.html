(“Kaiser”), in May of 1986. Dissatisfied with the diagnosis of migraine headaches and sinus problems, Ms. Wolfe consulted Dr. Fine, a specialist in ophthalmology, on June 4, 1986, to whom she again related her symptoms. After conducting a general eye examination, but not a CT (computerized tomography) scan, Dr. Fine concluded that Ms. Wolfe suffered from migraine headaches and sinus problems that possibly were exacerbated by an allergy. Ms. Wolfe returned to Kaiser approximately 10 months later, in April 1987, complaining of a loss of vision as well as pain above her eye. A CT scan performed at this time revealed a mass behind the right eye, which was later diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of the lacrimal gland, a particularly rare- form of lacrimal gland cancer. The complaint alleged that Kaiser and Dr. Fine were negligent in failing to diagnose Ms. Wolfe’s condition promptly and to take certain diagnostic steps, including a CT scan, that allegedly would have revealed the lacrimal gland adenocarci-noma nearly a full year prior to its actual discovery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Dr. Stefanyszyn’s 26(b)(4) statement explained that she would testify that a timely CT scan would have revealed the cancerous mass, that prompt treatment thereafter more probably than not would have cured the decedent of the cancerous condition, and that the failure to conduct a CT scan would to a reasonable degree of medical certainty result in her death. At her deposition, Dr. Stefanyszyn made clear that her testimony on causation would be based on the work of a Dr. John Wright, a British surgeon and researcher.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> According to Dr. Stefanyszyn, Dr. Wright had achieved a 70% cure rate in promptly treating lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma, and that the chances of survival dropped from 50% if the cancer was diagnosed within six months of the onset of symptoms to near 0% if more than a year passed without diagnosis.</p>

More fundamentally, Dr. Wright testified that starting about two months subsequent to the filing of his Rule 26(b)(4) statement he began to conduct a ten-year follow-up analysis of research on lacrimal gland cancer that he had published in a 1982 article, and that his colleagues, who had reviewed slides of the previously-diagnosed lacrimal gland cancers as part of the follow-up review, had eventually concluded that only one or two of the ten cancers identified in .the 1982 article as adenocarcinoma of the lacrimal gland, and only four or five of all the lacrimal gland cancers Dr. Wright had treated in the past 22 years, actually were lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, whereas Dr. Stefanyszyn’s testimony had been based on her understanding that Dr. Wright had treated 20 cases of lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma overall, 10 of which were discussed in his 1982 article, the follow-up analysis indicated that Dr. Wright had in fact encountered only one-fifth to one-quarter of that number.</p>

Thus, dismissal should be adopted as a remedy only in extreme circumstances and only after the trial court has considered lesser sanctions.

The trial court’s statements fall short of any finding that appellant engaged in “deliberate delay” or “contumacious conduct” by failing to inform Dr. Stefanyszyn of Dr. Wright’s expected testimony or by failing to locate another expert witness on the issue of causation. Rather, the trial court stated that counsel’s failure to send a copy of Dr. Wright’s Rule 26(b)(4) statement to Dr. Stefanyszyn, which Dr. Stefanyszyn stated might have led her to reconsider whether she should testify, constituted “negligence,” and that counsel was “wrong” not to take Dr. Wright’s deposition immediately after his Rule 26(b)(4) statement was filed. We similarly cannot conclude, and the trial court did not find, that appellant's delay in taking Dr. Wright’s deposition was deliberate. The crucial sentence in Dr. Wright’s Rule 26(b)(4) statement, to the effect that the figures relied on by Dr. Stefanyszyn were invalid, quite reasonably could be read as implying disagreement with Dr. Stefanysz-yn’s assessment of survival rates, rather than as a repudiation of the underlying data. On this point, we note that the record contains unrebutted evidence that the review of the cases previously diagnosed as lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma did not begin until two months after Dr. Wright’s Rule 26(b)(4) statement was filed, thereby undercutting any claim that the data were in fact known to be invalid at the time the statement was filed, or that immediately taking Dr. Wright’s deposition would have led appellant to discover that the data were invalid. Under these circumstances, the failure to search for another expert on causation after receiving Dr. Wright’s Rule 26(b)(4) statement does not appear to be “contumacious conduct.” In <em>Techniarts, supra, </em>572 A.2d at 1055, this court reversed a dismissal order where the trial court failed to identify the precise conduct it considered to be willful and this court’s independent review of the record revealed nothing rising to the level of deliberate misrepresentation.

Dr. Fine advanced no specific claim of prejudice, and the trial court’s statements suggest that it viewed the prejudice to Dr. Fine in terms of the increased costs of litigation resulting <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>from the grant of a continuance. However, increased litigation costs do not constitute prejudice in the sense of damage to the presentation of a defense. <em>See Braxton v.

We have previously held that the trial court is obliged to consider whether less severe sanctions would be more appropriate. <em>See, e.g., Durham v.

Other sanctions, such as sanctions placed directly on appellant’s attorney or a dismissal conditioned on the failure of the study to suggest a causal link between early diagnosis and successful treatment or, most particularly, a dismissal without prejudice <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>, were available for the trial court to consider as well. <em>See <a href="/a2d/490/1151-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="490 A.2d 1151" data-case-ids="7912451" data-case-paths="/a2d/490/1151-01">id.</a> </em>Such lesser sanctions might particularly be considered where the length of delay does not seem inordinate. Here, the period between the filing and dismissal of the complaint was less than three years (August 1988 to April 1991), during which time discovery was completed and a number of other pretrial matters attended to. <em>Compare Brown v.

It is of course relevant to this dismissal for want of prosecution that it came in connection with a motion for continuance. But the record becomes somewhat murky. This was not an eleventh-hour request. In the March 7 hearing, the trial court held out a distinct hope that a continuance would be granted if some reasonable hope existed of developing a database of cases of the rare lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma to replace that repudiated by Dr. Wright, and plaintiff took significant steps to that end.

There is a certain logic to an approach whereby a trial court at that point denies a plaintiff’s motion for a continuance and then lets the chips fall where they may. Plaintiff is squarely faced with two stark alternatives. He may proceed to trial as scheduled with whatever evidence he has, <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>and the trial court may make any merits ruling called for, such as on a motion for a directed verdict.

The <em>Taylor </em>court viewed the principal issue on appeal as whether a Rule 41(b) dismissal was appropriate where the case had progressed to the day of trial and the plaintiff, disappointed by rulings of the court which were adverse to her case, refused to go forward. A key to this court’s affirmance of the dismissal order and the related denial of the continuance was the plaintiff’s failure to move for a continuance until the day of trial and her refusal to proceed to trial <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>when she could have done so on the other theories of negligence in issue and then challenged the adverse pretrial rulings on appeal if necessary.

Given the rarity of lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma and the apparent absence of any compilation of cases of that cancer once Dr. Wright's study had been repudiated, it is difficult to see how a proposed expert could testify with any precision, prior to performing the proposed study, to the degree of likelihood that the study would enable him to conclude the existence of the causal connection to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. To prejudge the outcome of a study tends to defeat the purpose of the scientific inquiry. In any event, both Dr. Miller and Dr. Cooper expressed a belief that because in general the earlier a malignancy is discovered, the easier it is to cure, they saw a possibility of meaningful results. In particular, Dr. Miller outlined his expectations for the study in the following terms: "I also think it is reasonable to assume on the basis of probability that if most types of adenocarci-noma have a better prognosis if diagnosed earlier and treated earlier, that adenocarcinoma of the lacrimal gland would. That is the reason that I feel comfortable if someone says do you think there is a 50 percent chance that the survey will show that in fact early diagnosis and treatment does positively affect the prognosis. It is the reason that I feel even more comfortable that there is a 30 percent chance that it will positively affect the diagnosis. Not from anything I know about lacrimal gland adenocarci-noma. We have already established that nobody knows enough about it. That is why we’re here. On the basis of other types of adenocarci-noma, it is reasonable to assume that there may be a beneficial effect of early diagnosis and treatment.”</p>
