The following year Anderson-Stokes voluntarily recorded a declaration and declaration plan for the Pilot Point Condominium development under the Delaware Unit Property Act, 25 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2201 <em>et seq. </em>The declaration and declaration plan created by the developer provided for 32 town house units in five (5) buildings built on a portion of the leased land (“Phase I units”).

The declaration provided that Anderson-Stokes had the right to amend and supplement the declaration plan to establish “the exact site of each building” after construction was complete and to take other steps required to bring the entire project into full compliance with the Unit Property Act. The declaration could be amended to reflect changes in percentage ownership of the common elements by the recording of an amendment duly executed by all affected unit owners pursuant to 25 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2219 and § 2205.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Two months later, Anderson-Stokes received permission from the City of Lewes to build four buildings in the second phase (Phase II) in place of the projected one building, 100 unit, motel. Anderson-Stokes did not seek to amend the declaration although some revised drawings of Phase II were evidently filed in 1975. By April 15,1974, Anderson-Stokes had sold all 32 Phase I units. It then conveyed the Phase II land lease, a 9.5 acre parcel, included as part of the common elements of Phase I, to a bank as security for construction funds. Phase I owners were not consulted nor was the declaration amended. Anderson-Stokes developed Phase II into 28 town house units in four buildings during 1974 and early 1975.</p>

This transfer included the Phase I leased land as well as the unimproved Phase III and IV land. Thus, at this point, RGI and the second mortgage lender were holders of the land lease and Phase I owners and ASCO, as Phase II developer, were owners of the improvements. The Phase I owners protested against further development of Phases III and IV but no accord was reached.</p>

This amendment purported to incorporate the completed and occupied Phase II units into the Pilot Point Condominium and to affirm RGI’s further development rights in Phases III and IV. The amendment also declared that Phase I owners had waived or acquiesced to the substitution of 28 town house units for the 100 unit motel building originally planned for <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>Phase II and that the three building limitation had been “superseded and nullified . .. by acquiescence or waiver” to the four buildings in Phase II. The amendment also purported to permit twelve town house buildings, containing 68 units, in Phases III and IV. Thus, it is important to note that the amendment treated the unit substitution as limited to Phase II but the building limitation as entirely nullified. RGI simultaneously filed a declaration of acquiescence, approval and consent to ASCO’s amendment, conditioned on the validity of its future development rights in Phases III and IV. The Phase I owners protested and brought suit to enjoin further development and to declare the rights of all the parties. RGI defended and counterclaimed on various grounds.</p>

The words of the power are found in paragraph 6 of the declaration submitted under the Unit Property Act, an instrument not signed by the Phase I owners. The asserted execution and acknowledgment of the power by each Phase I owner is found in the lease/conveyance instrument, which incorporates paragraph 6 by reference. The lease said in part: “Subject to the adjustment as provided for in Paragraph 6 of the Declaration, which provision the Lessee herein acknowledges that he has read and consented to.” The Court of Chancery agreed that some type of agency was created but held that a power of attorney cannot be created in this manner and, therefore, it was ineffective to convey any interest in land.</p>

The Court found that any conclusion other than statutory “ownership” by the Phase I occupants was precluded by the designation of “unit owners” that Anderson-Stokes had applied to the Phase I occupiers in the declaration and leases, as well as by the terms of 25 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2217.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Further, the Court reasoned that, if the RGI theory of ownership were accepted, the attempted creation of a power of attorney in Anderson-Stokes would be pointless and unnecessary. Finally, the Court held that if RGI were found to be the owner, then a fraud would have been perpetrated on the Phase I owners as they would have received nothing from their substantial investment except the right to pay annual ground rent. Therefore, the Court ruled that public policy required that the documents must be construed to create ownership in the Phase I occupiers and against the party, or its successor, who voluntarily created those documents.</p>

The Court held that the only waiver that had occurred to the overall three building limitation was to the fourth building actually constructed. Otherwise the limitation remained and therefore precluded further construction. The Court of Chancery also found that no unjust enrichment accrued to the Phase I owners by the non-development of Phases III and IV since the Phase I owners were only insisting on their rights under the plan and they had not originally contemplated that the property would be “ringed and <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>packed to the limit with additional buildings and town houses.” <a href="/a2d/436/1268-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="436 A.2d 1268" data-case-ids="11294056" data-case-paths="/a2d/436/1268-01">436 A.2d at 1279</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

They also argue that summary judgment is prevented by a question of fact as to the Phase I owners’ waiver and acquiescence to the Phase II changes. RGI contends that both it and its predecessor, ASCO, detrimentally relied on the absence of protest during the construction of the four Phase II buildings and that the later objections to Phases III and IV were only an “afterthought” on the part of the Phase I owners who, in actuality, had gladly accepted a benefit in the Phase II substitution of town houses for a motel. RGI further alleges that it is an innocent party because the wrongful acts of its predecessor, ASCO, cannot be ascribed to it. Therefore, it claims that the Phase I owners will be unjustly enriched if further development is halted.</p>

The Court of Chancery noted the pertinent statutes but they are silent as to the exact form of the power. Title 25 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 151 provides that a letter of attorney concerning lands <em>or </em>tenements, acknowledged or certified, shall be recorded. Section 171 provides that it may be acknowledged in the manner prescribed for a deed.

Thus, since an agency created by agreement is subject to contract rules, 3 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Agency, </em>§§ 17, 23 (1962), it would seem to follow that a power of attorney is also subject to such rules and can be created by incorporation by reference. <em>See White v.

Specifically, in this waiver context, there is no justification for dividing the three building limitation. Nothing has been presented which could justify a fact-finder to infer that Phase I owners’ behavior contemplated a specific substitution of the four building town house complex for a motel. Indeed, the motel is only established in the 1973 declaration plan by a tentative placement on the architect’s drawing as a future building. That placement is in a phase of the project which is described in the 1973 plan as “the planning stage”. The placement was clearly subject to reasonable modification under the Plan. At best, RGI’s argument amounts to speculation that, had the Phase I owners been given the choice, they would have gladly substituted the four building, 32 unit town houses for the one building, 100 unit motel. But no such specific inquiry was made. All the Phase I owners did was to stand silent while four buildings were built contrary to an overall three building limitation in the Plan. By so acting, they neither eliminated the limitation entirely nor accepted four buildings in lieu of one motel in a particular portion of the project. At best they simply accepted a fourth building, one more than the limit, without any knowledge of the further final development plans. There is no basis for attributing to their conduct any waiver beyond the construction that occurred.</p>

The action by the City of Lewes does not affect the statutory rights of Phase I owners under the recorded plan. Nor is the <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>action by the City a circumstance which can be inferentially transmitted into the mental processes of the Phase I owners to change an overall three building limitation into a four building limitation for Phase II and one building for each of Phases III and IV. The validity of this conclusion was demonstrated by ASCO and RGI themselves: four years later they were busy concocting a revised plan to permit twelve buildings in Phases III and IV. RGI is, in effect, asking the Court to draw an inference which it did not draw itself.</p>

Again, there simply was no conduct of the Phase I Unit Owners to justify the inference drawn by RGI. Further, RGI clearly had access to the recorded instruments which contained the three building limitation and it had ample opportunity to examine them. It could have, and should have, discovered that limitation and cannot now use its own unreasonable reliance on an unjustified inference to estop the Phase I owners from asserting their statutory rights. <em>Wilson v.

There may indeed be a windfall to the Phase I owners. But, where both litigants claim to be innocent parties, the burden must fall on that party who was most active in bringing about the situation. <em>Crumlish </em>v. <em>Price, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/266/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="266 A.2d 182" data-case-ids="8062654" data-case-paths="/a2d/266/0182-01">266 A.2d 182</a>, 184 (1970).

The Chancery opinion and the briefs have focused on the effect of paragraph 6 of the declaration on the relationship between the parties in terms of true agency concepts. The Vice Chancellor noted that the power was created by the “agent” in a document not executed by the “principal”. It seems to us, however, that the power created in paragraph 6 may not be a simple agency but a power coupled with an interest. See W. Seavey, Law of Agency, § 11 (1964); 2 Williston on Contracts, § 280 (3d ed. 1959). Anderson-Stokes created this power for its own present and future benefit as the lessor/developer of the property interest subject to the power of attorney. Thus, neither it, nor its successors, intended to become mere agents, fiduciaries subject to the control of the Phase I owners. In light of our assumption that a power can be created through ordinary contract devices, including incorporation by reference, execution and acknowledgment of the lease/conveyances may have been sufficient to validate the power and grant the authority to ASCO to act. But the authority is strictly still confined by the precise terms of paragraph 6 of the declaration and those terms include the three building limitation.</p>
