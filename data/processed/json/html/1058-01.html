    <p id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[216,1132,1328,596]]]'>In his statement to the Board of Appeals, the Primary Examiner stated that appealed claims 1, 2, and 3 were “drawn to products which contain over ‘10%’ of zirconia”; that appellant’s application discloses only 10 to 15 per cent of zirconia content; and that, therefore, as those'claims called for 10 per cent <em>or more </em>of zirconia they were broader than the alleged invention defined in appellant’s application. The examiner further rejected all of the claims on the ground that they were not inventive over the references of record, in view of the fact that each of the references discloses cast blocks containing principally alumina and silica and zirconia within the range specified in the appealed claims (which range was held not critical) for use in glass tank or high temperature furnaces.</p>

    <blockquote id="b377-4" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[129,400,1326,452]]]'>The Cohart Refractories Company [owner of the reference patents according to appellant’s affidavit of record], of which the applicant is the General Manager, has, for the last ten years, been making <em>flux </em>blocks by melting a batch consisting of alumina and silica; as described in the Fulcher patent 1,615,750 cited, and during that time has sold over fifty thousand tons of such blocks. It has also owned the other Fulcher patent cited; namely, 1,615,751 which teaches that the addition of a comparatively large percentage of zirconia to the batch to be melted will improve the <em>flux </em>block made from such batch. Due to the high cost of the zirconia-silica alumina block it has not, however, been able to introduce it for commercial use although such a block has outstanding features fitting it for a <em>flux </em>block. [Italics quoted.]</blockquote>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[130,877,1327,294]]]'>Accordingly, it is contended by counsel that as appellant discovered that a cast silica-alumina refractory block containing only a small amount of zirconia, ranging from 10 to 15 per cent, bad the property, unexpected so it is said, of <em>resistance to the alkaline vapors from the hot glass and the </em>flames, appellant is entitled to a patent for his discovery.</p>
    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.7",377,[127,1179,1331,1195]]]'>The difficulty with that contention of counsel is, as stated in the decision of each of the tribunals of the Patent Office, that each of the reference patents clearly teaches that a cast refractory block containing principally silica and alumina, and up to 30 per cent of zirconia (as disclosed in the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,750) or from 10 to 6'0 per cent of zirconia (as disclosed in the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,751) resists the corroding action of the molten glass and the corrosive gases, as stated in the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,750, and also the high temperatures, abrasion, and corrosion <em>“at the places where </em>used,” as stated in the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,751. (Italics ours.) There is nothing in either of those patents to limit the refractory castings therein defined to use as flux blocks below the glass line in glass tank furnaces. On the contrary, each of those patents plainly suggests the use of refractory castings or blocks containing principally alumina and silica and <em>zirconia in the percentages here-inbefore set forth in glass ta/nk or high temperature furnaces </em>where-ever resistance to high temperatures, corrosion, and abrasion is required. Furthermore, there is nothing in appellant’s application to indicate that the percentage of zirconia (“over 10% but under 15%,” as called for in appealed claims 4, 5, and 6) is critical. The only reason for limiting the percentage of zirconia to between 10 and 15 per cent is, as stated in appellant’s application, that an additional amount, <em>although increasmg the resistance to chemical </em>attack, is not needed when the refractory block is used in the superstructure.</p>
    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.8",377,[131,2381,1324,92]],["BL_378.1",378,[206,231,1323,643]]]'>It is true that it is not stated in either of the reference patents that the use of zirconia in refractory blocks for use in glass tank <a id="p1062" href="#p1062" data-label="1062" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1062</a>furnaces or high temperature furnaces <em>would prevent incrustation </em>when such blocks are exposed to burning gases. Nevertheless, the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,751 discloses and claims cast refractory-blocks containing alumina and silica and from 10 to 60 per cent zirconia, and teaches that such refractory blocks will withstand high temperatures and will resist abrasion and corrosion “at the places where used,” that is, where used in a “furnace of high temperature.” Furthermore, the other reference patent No. 1,615,750 discloses cast refractory blocks containing principally alumina and silica and up to 30 per cent zirconia for use in glass tank furnaces or high temperature furnaces, and teaches that such refractory blocks will not only resist the corroding action of molten glass but will also resist the action of corrosive gases.</p>
    <p id="b378-3" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[203,881,1324,740]]]'>It is not claimed here that appellant is the inventor of a glass tank furnace having a superstructure between the glass line and the crown arch. On the contrary, the real claim made here by counsel for appellant is that the idea, which first occurred to appellant, that the refractory blocks disclosed in the reference patents, particularly the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,751, could be used advantageously in that part of the superstructure of a glass tank furnace between the glass line and the crown arch involves invention. There is nothing in any of the appealed claims to suggest that the refractory blocks therein defined are to be used to prevent the formation of crusts thereon by burning gases or alkaline vapors. In other words, so far as the appealed claims are concerned, they merely define a glass tank furnace having a superstructure between the glass line and the crown arch which is composed, at least in part, of the refractory blocks disclosed and claimed in the Fulcher patent No. 1,615,751.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[201,1628,1325,492]]]'>As hereinbefore noted, claims 1, 2, and 3 were rejected on the ground that they were broader than the disclosure in appellant’s application, and, although counsel for appellant has assigned error to that holding by the Board of Appeals, no contention is made in their brief that the board erred in that respect. Those claims are obviously broader than the disclosure contained in appellant’s application, and were, therefore, properly rejected. Furthermore, we are in agreement with the conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office that, in view of the teachings of the prior art, the appealed claims do not involve invention.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[202,2129,1323,93]]]'>For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is <em>affirmed.</em>
