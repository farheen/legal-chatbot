(“Mascaro”), appeals from the judgment entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, awarding Appellee, (“Delaware County”), $305,910.00 on its contractual indemnification claim. Specifically, Mascaro asks us to decide whether the trial court erred when it determined that Mascaro must reimburse Delaware County for expenses Delaware County incurred in settling the state and federal actions brought against it. We hold that the trial court properly entered judgment against Mascaro for the full amount of Delaware County’s settlement costs and attorney fees, plus interest. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

In late 1975, Delaware County requested bids for the removal and disposal of residue produced by these incinerators. On November 19, 1975, Delaware County awarded the bid for Incinerator # 2, located in Darby Township, to Mascaro. The contract paid Mascaro $1.98 per unit for 170,000 cubic yards, for a total price of $336,000.00. Per the terms of the contract, Mascaro chose the method of hauling and disposing of the waste. The disposal site, however, was subject to approval by Delaware County. Mascaro chose to dispose of the residue at the Gloucester Environmental Management Systems (“GEMS”) landfill site in Gloucester County, New Jersey, and Delaware County approved this site. Pursuant to this contract, Mascaro removed Delaware County’s waste residue from December 17,1975 until December 16,1976.</p>

In 1995, Delaware County was also joined in a New Jersey state court action brought by homeowners bordering the GEMS landfill. In both of these actions, Delaware County demanded that Mascaro defend and indemnify against the claims under the 1975 waste removal and disposal contract. However, Mascaro re<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>fused to take any action to defend Delaware County. Delaware County eventually settled both of these lawsuits, paying $73,565.00 to settle the CERCLA<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> federal action and $25,000.00 to settle the state court action. The legal fees and costs to defend both actions totaled $163,745.00. Travelers Insurance Co. covered $40,000.00 of these fees per an insurance policy with Delaware County.</p>

Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 227.1(b) requires that a post-trial motion must specify the grounds for relief and how they were preserved. <em>Id. </em>Otherwise, the issues are considered waived. <em>Id. </em>However, where an appellant properly preserves its issues at pre-trial proceedings or at trial, and raises them in the post-trial motion so that the trial court understands the issues, any arguable violation of Rule 227.1 does not require a waiver. <em>Meeting House Lane, Ltd. v.

    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[95,395,754,1427]]]'>¶ 7 Mascaro first argues that the services actually performed under the contract included only the collection and transportation but not the disposal of the waste residue. Mascaro contends it transported the residue to the GEMS landfill but had no part in disposing of it. Masca-ro believes the requirement that Delaware County approve the landfill chosen by Mascaro indicates the parties’ intention that a third-party landfill would perform the disposal duties and that Mascaro’s performance under the contract included only collection and transportation. Mascaro also argues that the language limiting indemnification to suits occurring “in the course of [Mascaro’s] performance” of the contract precludes its liability for any action that did not immediately arise during the period it was collecting and transporting the waste. For these reasons, Masca-ro maintains the parties did not intend for Mascaro to assume liability regarding the disposal of the waste residue. Mascaro concludes it was not obligated to defend and indemnify Delaware County against the improper dumping lawsuits. We disagree.</p>

The “General Conditions” section of the contract further states: “[Mascaro] shall defend, indemnify and save harmless [Delaware County] from and against all suits for claims that may be based on any alleged injury (including death) to any person or property that may be alleged to have occurred in the course of the performance of this Contract. ...” <em>(See </em>Specifications: Furnishing and Operating Equipment for Removal and Disposal of Residue from Incerator Plants No. 2 and 3, County of Delaware, dated December 17, 1975, at Paragraph <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>44c; R.R. at 30). Indeed, even the title of the contract indicates Mascaro’s obligation included waste disposal as well as transportation. <em>(See id.) </em>Mascaro’s narrow and detailed parsing of individual phrases contained in the contract ignores the explicit and unambiguous language expressing Mascaro’s duty to transport and dispose of the waste. <em>See Celley, supra; Steuart, <a href="/pa/498/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="498 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1776318" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0045-01">supra.</a> </em>Moreover, Mascaro’s assertion that it was responsible only for transportation of the waste residue is be-bed by the fact that it had the responsibility of choosing the location of disposal. Mascaro’s claim that it actually performed only the transportation aspect of the contract is also disingenuous considering it accepted full payment under the transportation and disposal contract. Thus, the trial court properly interpreted the contract to include a duty by Mascaro to transport and dispose of the waste residue. <em>See Liddle, <a href="/citations/?q=768%20A.2d%201188" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="768 A.2d 1188">supra.</a></em>

Here, both the state and federal suits against Delaware County were based on improper waste dumping at the GEMS location. Pursuant to its contractual obbgation to transport and dispose of the waste, Mascaro specifically chose GEMS as its disposal site. The decision to dump at GEMS, made by Mascaro in the course of its contract with Delaware County, created an alleged injury which led to the state and federal suits. Thus, in light of Mascaro’s contractual responsibility to dispose of the waste and the broad language contained in the indemnity clause, we agree with the trial court that Mascaro owed a duty to defend and indemnify Delaware County against the illegal dumping actions. <em>See Deskiewicz, <a href="/pa-super/385/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="385 Pa.

Mascaro contends Delaware County could have mitigated the costs of the settlements by joining municipalities and other transporters as third-party defendants in the federal and state suits. According to Mascaro, Delaware County has no explanation or rationale for not joining such parties, and doing so would have mitigated the settlement costs as the eventual settlement figure was based upon a volume of waste formula. Moreover, Mascaro contends that it should not be responsible in any event for the $40,000.00 already paid to Delaware County by Travelers Insurance. Mascaro concludes it cannot reasonably be responsible for the full settlement costs. We disagree.</p>
