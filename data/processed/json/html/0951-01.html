Dionne. Mastriano argues that the summary judgment was inappropriate because BTS owed Dionne a duty beyond providing him a safe exit from its cab, and because there remain genuine issues of material fact regarding a breach of duty. We decline Mastriano’s request to expand the special duty common carriers owe to their customers to provide a safe exit in a safe place. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

    <p id="b994-18" data-blocks='[["BL_994.17",994,[979,1625,751,611]]]'>[¶ 3] Douglas Dionne spent the early evening hours of August 4, 1997, drinking beer at the Elks Lodge in Skowhegan. A long-time friend, Flint Batehelder, observed Dionne drinking between 5:30 and 8:00 that evening. At approximately 8:00 P.M., Batehelder observed that Dionne’s speech began to be slurred and that he swayed on his feet. The bartender refused to serve Dionne any more liquor, and another patron called Blyer Taxi Service to give Dionne a ride home.</p>
    <p id="b994-19" data-blocks='[["BL_994.18",994,[978,2263,753,248]],["BL_995.1",995,[184,265,751,482]]]'>[¶ 4] When the taxi arrived, Batehelder walked with Dionne to the taxi. Dionne walked without physical assistance, but Batehelder observed him sway as he walked. Batehelder asked the cab driver, <a id="p953" href="#p953" data-label="953" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*953</a>Clifford Groder, Jr., to take Dionne home because he had had too much to drink. Batchelder explained that Dionne lived on East Madison Road and that Dionne would show him the way to the house. Batchel-der offered to pay the fare, but Dionne insisted on paying his own fare. When Batchelder last saw Dionne, he was speaking in a clear voice and was able to give instructions to Groder.</p>
    <p id="b995-5" data-blocks='[["BL_995.4",995,[184,778,751,481]]]'>[¶ 5] Once in the cab, Dionne refused to give Groder directions to his house. Instead, he directed Groder to take him to the Kennebec Valley Inn. When that establishment proved to be closed, he asked Groder to take him to Bloomfield’s Tavern. Once there, Dionne paid the fare and exited the cab. Groder watched him walk safely into the tavern and left the area to attend to other business.</p>
    <p id="b995-6" data-blocks='[["BL_995.5",995,[181,1290,752,643]]]'>[¶ 6] Groder had considerable experience as a taxi operator. With regard to intoxicated passengers, Groder’s practice was as follows: (1) for passengers who were so intoxicated that they could not function, as where they had to be picked up and placed in the cab, Groder would take them to the nearest hospital; and (2) for passengers who had consumed alcohol, but could walk and give clear directions, Groder would take them to the location they dictated. Once the passengers were safely deposited at the location, Groder would leave.</p>

When Groder arrived at Bloomfield’s, Dionne walked straight to the cab and gave Groder clear directions to drive him to a convenience store to purchase cigarettes. At the convenience store, Dionne walked straight into the store and Groder observed him speak with the clerk, obtain the cigarettes, pay for them, and walk from the store. Once back in the cab, Dionne directed Groder to return him to the Elks Lodge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b995-11" data-blocks='[["BL_995.8",995,[982,430,757,990]]]'>[¶ 8] At the Elks Lodge, Dionne paid the fare plus a large tip, exited the taxi, and walked past his automobile. Groder related that he knew that the automobile was Dionne’s because he observed Dionne approach it, kick it, and call it a “piece of junk.” Dionne walked over to a fence near a horseshoe pit, and Groder stated that he assumed Dionne was going to reheve himself. Groder heard other voices in the area and assumed Dionne would be safe. Groder then left the Elks Lodge to resume his work. Later that evening, Dionne died in a single-car accident while driving his automobile on the East Madison Road. At the time of the accident, Dionne’s blood-alcohol content was .25. The record is silent as to what, if anything, Dionne may have had to drink after he left Groder’s cab.</p>

BTS moved for a summary judgment arguing that Mastriano had not established that BTS breached any duty of care to Dionne. The Superior Court granted BTS’s motion, finding that Mastriano had “failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact to dispute Defendants’ statement that the place of discharge was reasonably safe and that the passenger/carrier relationship had ended.” The court also declined to “extend the carrier’s duty to include preventing Dionne from drinking and/or driving after safe discharge in a reasonably safe place.” Mastriano then timely appealed.</p>

In this analysis, Justice Cardozo, writing seven decades ago, suggested a useful point of distinction, asking “whether the putative wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm, or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good.” <em>H.R.

Should they refuse to let the passenger leave the vehicle and possibly subject themselves to assault or civil liability for illegal restraint? Should they refuse-to pick up the passenger and leave the person to fend for themselves by the side of the road?

    <p id="b998-12" data-blocks='[["BL_998.14",998,[976,969,751,865]]]'>[¶ 22] I respectfully dissent. The Court has correctly stated the general rule that the heightened duty a carrier owes its passenger continues until the carrier has discharged the passenger at a reasonably safe location. It has failed to recognize, however, that discharging an intoxicated passenger at his or her car may not be discharging the passenger at a reasonably safe location. The present case is particularly compelling because, taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the carrier was specifically informed at the time of engagement that the passenger had had too much to drink, and he could easily have inferred that the passenger was too drunk to drive.</p>

Thus, when a carrier is aware that its passenger has a disability due to intoxication, age, or mental or physical condition, it must exercise reasonable care not to discharge the passenger at a place where, due to the disability, he or she is exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm. <em>Portier v. Thrifty Way Pharmacy, </em><a href="/so2d/476/1132-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="476 So. 2d 1132" data-case-ids="7622990" data-case-paths="/so2d/476/1132-01">476 So.2d 1132</a>, 1140 (La.Ct.App.1985) <em>rev’d in part on other grounds, </em><a href="/so2d/479/0916-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="479 So. 2d 916" data-case-ids="7604068,7604161,7604201" data-case-paths="/so2d/479/0916-01,/so2d/479/0916-02,/so2d/479/0916-03">479 So.2d 916</a> (La.1985). The carrier’s determination of whether a particular location is <a id="p957" href="#p957" data-label="957" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*957</a>unreasonably risky involves not only an evaluation of the risks posed by the physical characteristics of the place of discharge, but also the foreseeable risks that may arise through the conduct of the passenger or a third party. <em>See </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 302A (1965) (“An act or omission may be negligent if the actor realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another through the negligent or reckless conduct of the other or a third person”). If the carrier fails to exercise the reasonable care required by the circumstances, it may be hable for its passenger’s injuries even though the passenger has stepped securely onto the street. <em>Torres v.

    <p id="b999-5" data-blocks='[["BL_999.4",999,[187,1293,751,501]]]'>[¶ 24] This rule does not in any way expand the carrier’s duty to discharge its passengers at a reasonably safe location, nor does it impose a paternalistic obligation on the carrier to affirmatively protect a passenger after he or she has disembarked. Rather, it arises necessarily from the carrier’s general duty in cases, such as the present one, involving passengers who are disabled due to intoxication.</p>

A carrier, pursuant to a reasonably implemented rule of operation, could simply refuse service to an apparently intoxicated individual who requested to be transported to an unsafe location such as his or her car. Carriers would continue to provide a socially beneficial service by transporting intoxicated individuals to safe locations such as the individual’s home, a hospital, a bus or airline terminal, or even a bar without the threat of liability. In this way, the deterrent effect of the rule on a carrier’s willingness to transport intoxicated individuals would be minimal and would only arise when the individual requested to be transported to an unsafe location.</p>

I would vacate the summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial.</p>
