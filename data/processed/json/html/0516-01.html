Community center buildings are permitted as a matter of right in S-P and less restrictive Districts (§ 4101.36).

Counsel for applicant in fact testified that the capital and operating expenses of such a venture were so substantial as to preclude the feasibility of a <em>community organisation </em>initiating such a project (R. 45). The purchase price of the property alone is $1 million, and this will entail a minimum payment by the lessee of $9,610 per month over a ten year period just to pay off the mortgage (R. 96). The additional buildings planned will further enlarge the fixed debt which must be borne in addition to the operating expenses. The Boys’ Club, with a membership of about 400 and an average daily use of between 20 and 30 boys, requires some $68,000 annually to operate its present limited facilities (R. 36, 52).
