F. &amp; A. Railway station in that part of the city which is occupied largely by colored people. That on the 17th day of January, 1930, he made application for license to operate a pool room on the property described; that the liscense was denied because of an ordinance prohibiting the operation of pool rooms except abutting on certain parts of certain streets. He contends that the ordinance limiting the operation of pool rooms to that particular territory is invalid and that the City of Tallahassee was without authority to enact such an ordinance. Alternative writ was issued and came on to be heard upon a motion to quash. The motion was granted and the petition dismissed. Writ of Error was taken. The ordinance referred to is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.8",526,[297,1564,1020,395]]]'>“No license shall be issued to any person or persons for operating a pool or billiard room within the corporate limits of the City of Tallahassee, except in the district hereinafter described, to-with: On Jefferson Street between Adams Street and Monroe Street; on Monroe Street between Park Avenue and Pensacola Street; on Park Avenue between Adams Street and Monroe Street;”</blockquote>
