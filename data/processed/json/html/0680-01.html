(Board Decision and Order at 3.) The Board found that, based on the economic equivalency analysis as provided in Section 65.161(a) of the unemployment regulations, the economic terms and conditions of the per diem position offered to Claimant for the upcoming year were substantially less than the terms and conditions of Claimant’s employment in the prior 2005-2006 academic year which had included multiple long-term assignments. Therefore, the Board held that Claimant was eligible for benefits under Section 402.1(1) of the Law for the week at issue. Employer now petitions this Court for review.</p>

    <p id="b731-4" data-blocks='[["BL_731.5",731,[178,311,756,903]]]'>Employer first argues that its letter of assurance did not specifically change the economic terms and conditions of the employment offered, but that the stated terms only differed with respect to consistency of available work, which is not a factor under the economic equivalency test. Additionally, Employer contends that the favorable terms Claimant enjoyed while receiving benefits and a salary are irrelevant to the analysis because Claimant returned to the per diem schedule later in the same year. Furthermore, Employer notes that Section 402.1(1) of the Law was intended to eliminate benefits for employees who can anticipate and prepare for stretches of scheduled unemployment, such as a teacher’s summer vacation.</p>

The Board claims that this is a case of first impression <em>subsequent </em>to the Department’s promulgation of Section 65.161 of the regulations, and that its interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference. Finally, the Board relies on a case from the state of Minnesota, and argues that it should be instructive to this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Claimant did begin the school year receiving the salary and benefits of a first year teacher when he filled in for a teacher who was on maternity leave. (FOF ¶ 3.) However, when that assignment ended, Claimant returned to the per diem pay schedule for six weeks. (FOF ¶ 5.) Claimant worked six weeks on a per diem basis before fortuitously securing another long-term substitute teaching position for several weeks during which Employer continued to pay him according to the per diem rate. (FOF ¶¶ 1,, 5, 6.) This particular assignment lasted from April 2006 until June 9, 2006, which was the end of the school year. (FOF ¶ 6.) In June 2006, Employer sent Claimant a letter assuring him of a per diem position for the following 2006-2007 school year. (FOF ¶ 7.) Lacking the benefit of hindsight, we find that Employer’s letter assured Claimant the same opportunity to secure limited long-term assignments and, failing that, daily work ás the previous year. The letter does not describe any alterations to Claimant’s accepted terms from the previous year. Thus, the letter does not contemplate a wage or hourly reduction.</p>
