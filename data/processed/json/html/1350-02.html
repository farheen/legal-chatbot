After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown.</p>

An examination of the record indicates that the trial justice exercised his independent judgment, that he analyzed the evidence, weighed the credibility of the witnesses and then determined that the verdict of the jury was not in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence and that it failed to do substantial justice between the parties. <em>See Pisaturo v.

We believe that he did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, nor was he otherwise clearly wrong. <em>See Fox v.
