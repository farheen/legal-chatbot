Grover, on his complaint alleging their tortious interference with the contract between Grover and Bates Fabrics, Inc. They contend that the trial court erred in (1) seating an allegedly biased juror, (2) failing to correct an allegedly improper statement in Grover’s closing argument, (3) refusing to grant a requested jury instruction, and (4) denying their motion at the close of all the evidence, renewed after the jury verdict, for a judgment as a matter of law. They also contend there was insufficient evidence of malice to support the jury’s award of punitive damages and, in the alternative, that the award was excessive. We affirm the judgment.</p>

In 1981 Grover was promoted to Vice-President of Sales and Marketing for Bates’s sales divisions. In this capacity, he supervised Pollack, the divisional manager of Bates’s Chain and Specialty Sales Division, and Goldfarb, a sales representative. In 1982 Grover fired Pollack from his position with Bates.</p>

Pollack harbored ill will toward Grover as a result of being fired by him from his position with Bates, and both Pollack and Goldfarb wanted to “get rid of’ Grover. Although Pollack had no knowledge as to the truth of the assertion, he reported to the Tangs that Grover was not servicing properly the accounts of Bates’s customers for which he was responsible. Both Pollack and Goldfarb falsely reported to the Tangs that Grover had uttered ethnic slurs about the Tangs. In February 1988 Grover received a telephone notification from Goldfarb that Grover would no longer have the Prestex account. This was confirmed by letter dated February 8, 1988. The Prestex account was subsequently handled by Gold-farb.</p>

On April 14, 1988, at Minette headquarters in North Carolina, Grover met with Eric Tang and Goldfarb. There was conflicting evidence as to whether Pollack attended this meeting. At the meeting, Grover was told by Eric Tang that Prestex was no longer his account and that he would be receiving six months written notice of termination. By letter dated April 14, 1988 Grover received formal notice that his contract with Bates was being terminated. No “just cause” was stated.</p>

Here the record reflects that prior to the trial the defendants knew that in response to the jury questionnaire, Bonen-fant had stated his occupation as “purchasing agent.” The trial court concluded its voir dire by asking the panel members whether there was any reason that any of them believed they could not be fair and impartial in deciding the case. There was no response from the panel members. After hearing challenges for cause and peremptory. 'challenges, the trial court appointed Bonenfant to serve as the jury foreman. Before Bonen-fant was made aware of this fact, however, he voluntarily addressed the court, stating, “You didn’t ask. I was a professional commission salesman for 20 years and I don’t know if that would help or hurt, but I thought somebody might want to know.” On inquiry, Bo-nenfant assured the court he would have no difficulty basing a verdict on the evidence without drawing on his own experience.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The court denied the defendants’ challenge for cause of Bonenfant.</p>

During his closing argument, Grover argued that Goldfarb and Pollack falsely accused Grover of making derogatory ethnic statements about the Tangs, stating that Pollack told the Tangs that Grover had called them “chinks, coolies, and gooks.” In response to the defendants’ objection that Grover’s assertion that Pollack used the expression “chinks, coolies and gooks” was unsupported by the evidence, the trial court stated it would instruct the jury that its recollection of disputed testimony would govern its deliberations and that it could make inquiry concerning such testimony during its deliberations.

    <p id="b771-8" data-blocks='[["BL_771.7",771,[978,765,752,986]]]'>Contrary to the defendants’ contention, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that but for the defendants’ fraudulent interference, the Grover-Bates contract would have continued. Grover presented evidence that between 1985 and 1988 he was Bates’s most productive salesperson. During 1986 his sales figures were four times greater than the next most productive salesperson and accounted for about twenty-five percent of Bates’s total sales. Bates’s president, Thomas LeVeen, testified that he believed it would have been “utter foolishness to fire a man who accounted for 25 percent of [Bates’s] sales.” In 1986, Bates had a negative cash flow, but turned a profit in 1987, a year in which Grover had the highest sales volume. Based on this evidence, the jury reasonably could conclude that the Grover-Bates contract would have continued but for the defendants’ tortious interference.</p>

We find nothing in the record, and Minette points to nothing, to establish that the jury did not properly consider all mitigating factors submitted to it in making its determination and, accordingly, it cannot be said that the amount of the punitive damages awarded is clearly excessive. <em>See Tuttle v.

Minette also contends that the damages assessed against it, when compared with the damages assessed against Pollack and Goldfarb, are inconsistent with the theory of vicarious liability. We decline to address whether the damage awards are inconsistent. Minette raised this issue for the first time by this appeal. Moreover, the error, if any was invited by Minette. The jury verdict form proposed by Minette requested the jury to apportion the damages for tortious interference between Pollack, Goldfarb, and Minette. The verdict form actually submitted to the jury similarly requested the jury to determine damages separately for Pollack, Goldfarb, and Mi-nette, and our review of the record reveals that the parties agreed to this verdict form. We have previously stated that a litigant in a civil action who not only fails to interpose any objection but acquiesces in the action taken cannot later be heard to complain. <em>Medical Care Dev. v.
