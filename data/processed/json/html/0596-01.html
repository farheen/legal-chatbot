The Concord policy contained an exclusion whereby coverage did not apply to any vehicle while used as a “public or livery conveyance.” The Referee found, and his conclusion is not challenged in this appeal, that Mrs. Letellier’s operation of a school bus, at the time of the accident, relieved Concord of any obligation to defend or to pay any judgment that might be awarded in the pending death action, since he construed the school bus to be a “livery conveyance.”</p>

Since Mrs. Letellier was authorized to operate a school bus on the day of the accident, she was also covered as an “insured” under the terms of the Home policy. Nevertheless, Home denied any obligation to defend Mrs. Letellier in the underlying death action on the basis of several exclusions appearing in that policy. It was the Referee’s conclusion that one such exclusion did relieve Home of any “contractual obligation either to defend or to pay any judgment that might be forthcoming in the pending case.” The correctness of this holding is the subject of this appeal.</p>
