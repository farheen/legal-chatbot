With this rejection we do not agree. While each of Trickey and Gurck discloses pipe ends respectively of bell and spigot configuration, we note that in each of said references the bell <a id="p1429" href="#p1429" data-label="1429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1429</a>component is covered by reinforced concrete extending outwardly therefrom. This being so, even were the split ring arrangement of Damsel to be regarded as applicable to the device of Trickey or Gurck, we do not think that it would be obvious to apply the clamping ring in the structural manner required by the claim. The latter recites the clamping ring as cooperating with flanges attached respectively to the bell and spigot components. The prior art before us does not teach the use of concrete flanges for clamping purposes, but teaches only the provision of metal flanges for this purpose, and in the light of the aforementioned reinforced concrete covering for the bell components in Trickey and Gurck we doubt that the use of a metal flange, attached to the bell component as required by the claim on appeal, would be obvious to one skilled in the art. We will not sustain the rejection of claim 7 based on Trickey or Gurck in primary reference aspect.</blockquote>

    <p id="b753-5" data-blocks='[["BL_753.5",753,[194,1117,1325,602]]]'>Both Mitchell et al. and Damsel disclose joints for concrete pipes. Mitchell et al. shows a concrete pipe joint in which a metal bell on one pipe end is adapted to receive a metal spigot on the end of a pipe to be joined thereto. The surfaces of the bell and the spigot are, the patent states, “rounded to conform to arcs of circles of relatively large diameter, so that when two sections are joined there will be provision for a limited movement of one with respect to the other without impairment of the joint.” The spigot is provided with a groove filled with packing material. The parts are held in sealed relation by bolts which apply clamping pressure to lugs mounted on the bell and spigot. The bell and spigot are provided with additional lugs which are tied together on each pipe by reinforcing rods.</p>
    <p id="b753-6" data-blocks='[["BL_753.6",753,[195,1727,1322,285]]]'>Damsel shows a concrete pipe joint in which the ends of the pipes to be joined are provided with metal ferrules having radially extending shoulders.

    <blockquote id="b754-3" data-blocks='[["BL_754.4",754,[315,409,1325,458]]]'>* * * It would be obvious, the Board pointed out * * *, to bring together into one joint the bell and spigot arrangement of Mitchell et al. and the split ring channel clamping means of Damsel. As to appellant’s argument that assembly of the Mitchell et al. joint required circumferential alignment of the pipes (to bring the holes in lugs E into alignment to accommodate bolts G), the Board correctly noted that any disadvantage in the Mitchell et al. clamp in that respect would seem to supply a motive to substitute a clamp not having the disadvantage. The pipe ends in the Damsel joint have continuous flanges which obviate the need for orientation of the pipes. Although Damsel does not show his clamp as applied to a bell and spigot type of joint, his disclosure is effective to teach use of the clamp in any joint in which it would be advantageous.</blockquote>
    <p id="b754-4" data-blocks='[["BL_754.5",754,[314,892,1324,501]]]'>We note in passing, however, that even if the suggested reconstruction and combination of the references is permitted, the thus constructed joint lacks certain essential features of appellant’s joint as claimed. These features, as claimed in claim 7, require certain relative dimensions of the spigot and the bell as set forth in (e) above, and the enclosing of the telescoped portions of the bell and spigot by the split ring as set forth in (j) above, in order that the split ring and flanges may cooperate to permit some cocking of two adjacent pipe lengths without impairing the tightness of the joint, as recited in (n) above.</p>

We think, therefore, that appellant has done more than give the art the concept of combining the Damsel clamp with the Mitchell et al. joint. He has, instead, reconstructed the basic Mitchel et al. joint in such a manner that the Damsel type clamp may be used. Without this reconstruction, the Damsel clamp would <a id="p1431" href="#p1431" data-label="1431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1431</a>not function to draw the pipe ends together to provide the desired liquid-tight joint.

Since those arguments were not made below, they should, it is submitted, be ignored here. The Board could not properly be held to have erred in failing to consider appellant’s present contentions if they were not made to the Board. * * *</blockquote>

Such cases to the contrary notwithstanding, however, we think that a blanket statement condemning new arguments is far too broad. The real question should be whether the new argument is such as to raise a new issue. Certainly we cannot consider new issues or new grounds of rejection on appeal. But we think it would be in disharmony with one of the primary purposes of appellate review were we to refuse to consider each nuance or shift in approach urged by a party simply because it was not similarly urged below. Here appellant is merely stating in somewhat different words one of the reasons why he thinks the board erred in holding his claimed invention obvious.
