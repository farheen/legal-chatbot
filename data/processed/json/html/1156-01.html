The trial court found that the transaction at issue was a sale of liquor on credit in violation of D.C. Code 1973, § 25-133 and that therefore the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We affirm.</p>

Sometime in early February of 1974 an agreement was made between plaintiff Fields and defendant Hunter for the sale of a substantial quantity of liquor. On the day that the liquor was to be picked up, Fields was told that Hunter did not have all the money in cash. Hunter offered to pay about $1400 in cash if Fields would accept a postdated check for the remaining <a id="p1158" href="#p1158" data-label="1158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1158</a>$1000. This check was to be redeemed for cash in a few weeks when Hunter had received money from a third party.
