The plea agreement merely stated: ‘ ‘In exchange for my plea of guilty, the State, my counsel and I have agreed to recommend the following: The State will stipulate to life with the possibility of parole.” The record reflects that, upon entering the negotiated plea, counsel for Stubbs informed the court of the negotiations as follows:</p>

The State then rested without further comment. Thereafter, the district court sentenced Stubbs to consecutive life terms in the Nevada State Prison, <em>without </em>the possibility of parole.</p>

While I stand by my joinder in the dissent in <em>Statz, </em>I would note that <em>Statz </em>is clearly distinguishable from this case. The prosecutor in <em>Statz </em>called upon a victim witness to give substantive testimony at sentencing, not victim impact testimony as was the case here. I would also note in this connection that the State is statutorily required to notify victims to facilitate their availability during the sentencing process. <em>See </em>NRS 176.015. I cannot agree that the mere introduction by a prosecutor of a victim witness to the court and submitting a few neutral preliminary questions to the witness could, of itself, have any substantive effect on a judge’s decision. It is the testimony itself, not the State’s role as a facilitator, that creates the substantive effect of victim impact testimony.</p>

Even if the State had done so, it was within the district court’s discretion to disregard the recommendation. <em>See </em>Villalpando v.

Given that the district court was aware of the State’s stipulation regarding sentencing, that the defendant was clearly aware that the stipulation was not binding, and the fact that Stubbs sought no formal relief from the district court, I do not believe that the record of the sentencing hearing demonstrates that reversible error has occurred. <em>See </em>Drummond v. State, <a href="/nev/86/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="86 Nev. 4" data-case-ids="4847060" data-case-paths="/nev/86/0004-01">86 Nev. 4</a>, 9, <a href="/nev/86/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="86 Nev. 4" data-case-ids="4847060" data-case-paths="/nev/86/0004-01">462 P.2d 1012</a>, 1015 (1970).</p>

The statement of the prosecutor, if accurate, was clearly improper. At the very least, such a statement would tend to undermine the integrity of the proceedings and public confidence in the judicial process. Further, the statement, if made, would, in retrospect, give new significance to the comments at sentencing about the problems of proof that led to the negotiated arrangement. In the light that the prosecutor may have tried to “finesse” the district court into violating the agreement, again assuming the extra-judicial statements were made, resentencing would be appropriate. Thus, I would remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine if these comments were made, or whether the report quoting the statements was substantially áccurate.</p>
