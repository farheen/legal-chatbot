Although this proposition suggests broader questions concerning the limits placed by the criminal law on the use of corporal punishment in parental discipline, we are not persuaded by the specific arguments that appellant presents. We hold that the government may prosecute parent-child assaults as violations of the simple assault statute, and that the government does not need to prove malice in order to overcome the parental discipline defense and secure a conviction. We therefore affirm appellant’s conviction in this case.</p>

Before long a commotion broke out, attracting the attention of witnesses who were picnicking nearby. These witnesses watched as appellant, screaming obscenities, pummeled and kicked her six-year-old daughter, who was crying and trying to run away. Dismayed and alarmed, the witnesses summoned the police. Appellant was arrested and charged with second degree cruelty to children, a ten-year felony. The government later dropped that charge, choosing instead to prosecute appellant on one count of simple assault, a 180-day misdemeanor. A bench trial on that charge was held before the Honorable Mildred M. Edwards.</p>

The beating continued after appellant knocked her daughter to the ground. The <a id="p1236" href="#p1236" data-label="1236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1236</a>witnesses particularly remembered seeing appellant smack her daughter’s face with the back of her hand, on which appellant was wearing several prominent rings.</p>
    <p id="b1292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1292.5",1292,[221,477,754,1053]]]'>Testifying in her own defense, appellant explained that her daughter had been misbehaving all afternoon and was especially wild and overexcited at the picnic area. Appellant feared that the child, who was running around in a “rage,” would fall in the Potomac River, burn herself on a hot barbecue grill, or run in the path of a car. After exhausting non-violent efforts to distract and quiet her daughter, appellant said, she grabbed and hit the child. Appellant also kicked her in the back of her leg, in order, she said, to stop her from running away toward the river. Appellant admitted that she was angry and had lost control of the situation. She insisted, however, that she never intended to hurt her daughter, but only to discipline her for her own good. Appellant testified, without contradiction, that the child suffered no physical injuries.</p>

Thereafter, in closing argument, counsel argued that appellant was privileged to employ reasonable force “for the purpose” of parental discipline, so long as she did not use “excessive” force and cause her daughter serious physical injury.</p>

Crediting the testimony of the government’s “reasonable eyewitnesses,” the judge rejected appellant’s claim that she had administered reasonable discipline. Rather, Judge Edwards found, appellant manifestly developed “a pretty high level of anger” when her unruly daughter continued to disobey her, “cross[ed] the line into a wilful display of anger at the child, .... lost it with [her daughter] and ... beat [her].”</p>

    <p id="b1292-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1292.10",1292,[1020,677,749,548]]]'>Appellant makes two arguments for reversal of her conviction. First, she argues that the misdemeanor simple assault statute, D.C.Code § 22-404(a) (2001), does not apply at all to assaults by parents on their own children. Appellant argues that parent-child assaults may be prosecuted only under the felony cruelty to children statute, D.C.Code § 22-1101 (2001). Thus, appellant contends, the information in this case fails to state an offense.</p>
    <p id="b1292-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1292.11",1292,[1020,1258,750,504]]]'>Second, and alternatively, appellant argues that even if D.C.Code § 22-404(a) is applicable to parent-child assaults, the government must prove that a parent acted with malice in order to overcome the “parental discipline” defense. Appellant contends that the government failed to prove malice in this case, and that the evidence therefore was insufficient to support her conviction.</p>
    <p id="b1292-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1292.12",1292,[1019,1786,751,664]]]'>The government argues that appellant forfeited her first argument by not making it to the trial court, and that in any event, the simple assault statute does not contain any exception, express or implied, for assaults by parents on their children. As to appellant’s second argument, the government acknowledges the parental discipline defense to a charge of simple assault, but argues that it may overcome that defense without having to show malice, by proving either lack of a genuine disciplinary purpose or the use of unreasonable force.</p>

The scope of our review is not limited to plain error. On the merits, however, we reject appellant’s contentions and agree with the government. We hold that the simple assault statute, D.C.Code § 22-404(a), applies to crimes by parents against their own children. We further hold that the government is not obliged to prove malice in order to defeat the parental discipline defense. The government may refute that defense by proving that the parent’s purpose in resorting to force against her child was not disciplinary, or that the force she used was unreasonable.</p>

It is less immediately clear that appellant preserved her claim that the information fails to state an offense. As appellant thus phrases it, this claim is not a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Appellant’s phrasing is inapt, however. It is incontrovertible that the information, which charges that appellant “unlawfully assaulted and threatened in a menacing manner [K.N.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>], in violation of Section 22-504, District of Columbia Code,” does state an offense, <em>viz., </em>the offense of simple assault.

The statute provides that “[w]hoever unlawfully assaults, or threatens another in a menacing manner, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or be imprisoned not more than 180 days, or both.” D.C.Code § 22-404(a) (2001). This language makes no exceptions; it applies to parent-child assaults as to any other assaults. It is true that the statute admits of common law defenses, including the “parental discipline” privilege discussed in the next section of this opinion. But the very existence of that qualified privilege confirms that the (now-codified) common law offense of assault encompassed unjustified assaults by parents on their children. Like the plain words of the statute, nothing in the relevant common law or more than a century of case law remotely suggests that the simple assault statute does not apply to parent-child assaults. <em>Cf.

However; we add that nothing in the legislative history of the 1901 legislation indicates that Congress intended to exclude parent-child assaults from the law’s sway when it merely codified the common law offense.</p>

Appellant argues that the 1885 statute codified and hence replaced the common law crime of parent-child assaults. This thesis suffers from manifold defects. To begin with, it finds no support in the statutory language. To quote the pertinent portion of the current statute (which for the present purpose does not differ materially from the original 1885 provision, though it now incorporates a specific <em>mens rea </em>element and divides the offense into first and second degrees), “a person” commits the crime of cruelty to children in either the first or second degree if that person “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly tortures, beats, or otherwise willfully maltreats a child ... or engages in conduct <a id="p1240" href="#p1240" data-label="1240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1240</a>which creates a grave risk of bodily injury to a child....” D.C.Code § 22-1101(a). Nothing in this language implies that the cruelty to children statute precludes the prosecution of parents for simple assault or any other criminal offense. Indeed, the cruelty to children statute does not even mention parents or others acting in a parental capacity. Although the cruelty to children statute and the simple assault statute may overlap in their application to some crimes against children, the statutes “are fully capable of coexisting,” for there is no “positive repugnancy between the provisions.” <em>United States v.
