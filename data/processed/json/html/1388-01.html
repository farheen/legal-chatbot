He contends, first, that the government failed to establish that the hub cap and tire which he attempted to take had some value. In petit larceny cases, the government need not establish the monetary value of the items taken; only real value to the owner need be shown. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>D.C.App., <a href="/a2d/345/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="345 A.2d 144" data-case-ids="8015037" data-case-paths="/a2d/345/0144-01">345 A.2d 144</a>, 145 (1975). An intact tire had an obvious value to the owner of the car who, while the police were on the scene, approached the car, intending to drive it away.</p>

United States, </em>D.C.App., <a href="/a2d/308/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="308 A.2d 773" data-case-ids="8034368" data-case-paths="/a2d/308/0773-01">308 A.2d 773</a>, 774 (1973). Leftridge is liable as a participant, however, if he knowingly assisted the principal, even in a small way. <em>See Montgomery v. United States, </em>D.C.App., <a href="/a2d/384/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="384 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="8001289" data-case-paths="/a2d/384/0655-01">384 A.2d 655</a>, 658 (1978). Leftridge acknowledged to the police in his version of the incident that he was watching a friend change a tire and that he had been asked by his friend to watch whether the jack would fall or not. Even under this version, therefore, Leftridge was participating in the act.</p>
