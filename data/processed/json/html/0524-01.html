Although the rules of evidence in pretrial bail proceedings are greatly relaxed <em>(see </em>D.C.Code 1972 Supp., § 23-1321 (f)), fundamental constitutional rights cannot be subject to such dilution.

      <em>ex parte </em>representations of asserted facts as. they relate to bail <em>(see </em>D.C.Code 1972 Supp., § 23 — 1321 (b)) raised such serious constitutional questions that the practice would almost never be used or permitted. Whether couched in terms of due process or effective assistance of counsel, or any other basic right in the criminal process, use of such police reports without disclosure to defense counsel, even on the issue of bail, cannot be justified on this record. <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>I readily decline the government’s offer to further perpetuate this injustice by viewing those reports <em>in camera.</em>

A local specialized organization has agreed to take third-party custody.

Both appellants were born in the District of Columbia.</p>

From the available record it appears that this is not their first encounter with the law by virtue of antisocial conduct. If, indeed, either might be considered dangerous, it does not appear that serious consideration has been given to conditions of release calculated to prevent further unlawful conduct. Moreover, I am unable to say, on the basis of the mechanical conclusions of the trial court and this record, that there is a likelihood of flight in these cases warranting an unattainable money bond.</p>

It must be remembered that subsection (a)(5) of § 23-1321, <em>supra, </em>permits imposition of “any other condition” of release which will reasonably assure future court appearance or community safety. One would suppose that this provision permits the use of a variation of the <em>frankpledge </em>system used by early Anglo-Saxons and the Normans. Use of such a system, with modification to fit the times, permits a condition of release to include twenty-four hour, third-party custody (physical, not theoretical) by as many custodians as are necessary and acceptable to the court. Those custodians could be obliged to agree that at least one would be with the accused <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>at all times and prevent him from committing any unlawful act or taking flight, and that in the event he, nonetheless, did do either, to bring the accused, by force if necessary, before the court forthwith. Whether such condition of release would bring forth such custodians and thus release of the accused from jail is another matter, but at least it would facially be consistent with the history of bail and our present bail laws. In this connection, see the excellent work by Hermine Herta Meyer, Constitutionality of Pretrial Detention, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Geo.%20L.J.%201140" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="60 Geo.

A discussion of the <em>frankpledge </em>system appears at 1175-76.</p>
