Appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b1281-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1281.8",1281,[120,970,753,660]]]'>¶2 In the early morning hours of August 20, 2007, Officer Gary Ross received a dispatch call to respond to a hit and run accident. At the time, he was on patrol in full uniform and a marked police car. Officer Ross arrived at the scene at 2:53 a.m. where he encountered a witness who reported that he heard a crash, went outside, and viewed a vehicle reversing away from the vehicle it had struck and head westbound on Wyndamere Road. The witness described the vehicle as a silver “rounded sedan” or “coupe.” N.T., 3/28/08, at 4.</p>
    <p id="b1281-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1281.9",1281,[119,1658,754,604]]]'>¶ 3 Officer Ross surveyed the scene and noted that there were skid marks in a grass area between the road and the parking lot where the accident occurred. The marks indicated that the vehicle had been traveling on Yorktown Road and was attempting to turn left onto Wyndamere Road when the operator turned too wide and went off the road. These marks also indicated that the vehicle headed westbound on Wyndamere Road after leaving the accident scene.</p>
    <p id="b1281-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1281.10",1281,[117,2297,757,402]],["BL_1281.11",1281,[919,292,753,577]]]'>¶ 4 Officer Ross then departed the scene, following in the direction of the perpetrator’s vehicle. Approximately one mile down the road, at the intersection of Wyndamere Road and Old Quaker Road, Officer Ross and other officers discovered a stop sign that had been struck by a vehicle, thereby fully pushing it over. It had been raining that night and the roads were wet, as was the embankment where the stop sign was located. There were tire tracks in the mud of the embankment, which indicated that the vehicle was traveling westbound on Wyndamere Road and had attempted to turn right at Old Quaker Road, but instead had gone directly into the stop sign. There were also muddy tire marks indicating that the vehicle had continued on Old Quaker Road.</p>
    <p id="b1281-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1281.12",1281,[921,916,749,942]]]'>¶ 5 Officer Ross drove on Old Quaker Road a short distance until he reached Lewisberry Road. He did not observe anything out of the ordinary there and so he doubled back to the one road that intersected Old Quaker Road in the stretch between Wyndamere and Lewisberry. This road led up to an apartment complex, and shortly after driving into the apartment complex, Officer Ross noticed an open garage door with the lights on and a silver vehicle pulled into the garage. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Officer Ross then radioed for backup and alighted from his vehicle to investigate further. The time was approximately 3:30 a.m., which was only thirty seven minutes after Officer Ross responded to the scene of the hit and run.</p>

There were wet tire tracks leading into the garage. Although the vehicle’s engine was off, it was emitting a ticking sound. The garage was not set up as a normal garage, but instead looked like “party headquarters, [with a] bunch of memorabilia and alcohol containers everywhere.” <em>Id. </em>at 7. There was a couch pinned between the front of the vehicle and the garage wall, and there was a second couch resting or leaning on the hood of the vehicle. Finally, Officer Ross observed some damage to the front right side of the vehicle, but <a id="p1254" href="#p1254" data-label="1254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1254</a>could not tell the extent of the damage from outside the garage.</p>
    <p id="b1282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1282.4",1282,[191,409,753,757]]]'>¶ 7 Officer Ross then walked up to the abutting apartment and knocked on the door, but nobody answered. He then walked into the garage and knocked on another door that led directly from the garage into the apartment, but again there was no response. Because of the heavy tinting of the windows of the vehicle, Officer Ross could not see inside it. Therefore, he opened the driver door and was immediately struck by a strong smell of alcohol. And there was Appellant passed out and slumped over in the driver’s seat with an open bottle of vodka on the passenger seat. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>
    <p id="b1282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1282.5",1282,[190,1191,753,710]]]'>¶ 8 Officer Ross attempted to communicate with Appellant, but he was so inebriated that even after Officer Ross yelled at him “again and again,” he did not wake up. <em>Id. </em>at 8. Appellant finally began to respond when Officer Ross physically removed him from the vehicle. Although Appellant was sluggish, he eventually gained his bearings enough to know where he was and to stand up. Officer Ross arrested Appellant and took him to a hospital for a blood test. A blood test was performed at 5:00 a.m., which indicated a blood alcohol content of .179 percent. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>

Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion to suppress the results of the blood test in which he alleged that Officer Ross’s warrantless entry into the garage was unconstitutional. Finding probable cause and exigent circumstances, the trial court denied the motion. The case then proceeded to a jury trial at the conclusion of which Appellant was found guilty of DUI and several other offenses. As Appellant had prior DUI convictions, the court sentenced Appellant to five years of intermediate punishment, including forty five days’ incarceration followed by ninety days’ house arrest and fines. Appellant then filed this appeal presenting one question for our review:</p>

Consequently, we shall limit our analysis to the guarantees of Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which in any event confers protections that are either coterminous with or greater than those provided by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As Officer Lewis made his way back up the driveway, Lee’s wife exited the house and approached the officers. Officer Lewis asked Lee’s wife who had been driving the truck, and she responded that Lee had been driving it. When Lee’s wife advised that Lee was inside the house sleeping, the officers asked her to go get him so they could talk to him. She did so, at which time Lee greeted the officers on his front porch.

At the time the police arrived and conducted the warrantless entry onto the defendant’s property, the only evidence on which they were proceeding was that a vehicle had struck a mailbox and a tree and therefore, the police were simply investigating a report of property damage. Thus, the gravity of the offense was low. We also reasoned that since there was no evidence to demonstrate that anyone was aware of the police presence, there was no likelihood that evidence would be destroyed or that the perpetrator would escape while the police secured a warrant.

    <blockquote id="b1286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1286.4",1286,[229,661,713,1018]]]'>Moreover, though not charged with offenses categorized as violent, Dom-mel’s actions indicated either a callous disregard of, or the inability to regard at all, both the violent automobile collision which he caused and subsequent official commands to stop. Officer Kondras thus did not enter the home of beer drinking minors or marijuana smokers, but of a hit and run/DUI suspect who, for whichever reason, had shown no concern for his victim’s well-being and was now eluding police. Though neither wanted for a felony nor believed to be armed, there was nevertheless reason under these facts to consider Dommel either chemically impaired or highly unpredictable and perhaps dangerous. Dommel’s actions thus warranted immediate pursuit.</blockquote>

Although Appellant claims “there was no suggestion that Appellant was driving under the influence,” this assertion defies ordinary experience and logic. Brief for Appellant at 9. This case does not involve a single hit and run accident occurring during daytime or evening hours. Rather, at approximately 3 a.m., in the wee hours of the morning, Appellant careened his vehicle through the public streets, repeatedly misdirecting his vehicle and causing it to deviate significantly from the proper course of travel. He left a trail of destruction that led the police to his doorsteps only to discover his vehicle ploughed into the makeshift social imbibing area into which he had converted his garage. The first thought that would come to any reasonable person’s mind upon observing such conduct at that time in the morning would be that the operator of the vehicle was severely intoxicated. Thus, we conclude that after viewing the scene of the initial hit and run, the pushed over stop sign, and the condition of the vehicle in the garage with one couch pinned against the wall and another leaning on its hood, Officer Ross possessed probable cause to suspect that Appellant had been driving under the influence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b1286-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1286.8",1286,[988,1752,753,676]]]'>¶ 18 Second, while a DUI offense is a misdemeanor, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3803, it was one of the few, if not only misdemeanors, that results in over 500 deaths per year in our Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, <em>2006 Pennsylvania Crash Facts &amp; Statistics, available at </em>http://www.dot.state.pa.us/Internet/ Bureaus/pdBHSTE.nsf/InfoFb06?Open Form. Of course, we gravely view an offense with such deleterious effects. Consequently, we conclude that the gravity of the offense was high.</p>

      <a id="p1259" href="#p1259" data-label="1259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1259</a>¶ 19 Third, Officer Ross arrived at Appellant’s garage only a short time after receiving the initial radio call. The wet tire tracks leading into the garage indicated that the vehicle had recently pulled into the garage. The ticking sound from the engine is the type of sound that a hot engine normally emits immediately after it has been turned off. The garage door was open and the lights were on. Moreover, upon observing the silver vehicle parked in the garage in such an odd manner and with damage to its front end, Officer Ross would have been justified in believing that this was the same vehicle involved in the two previous incidents. Therefore, we conclude that these observations gave Officer Ross a strong reason to believe that he would locate the perpetrator if he entered the premises.</p>
    <p id="b1287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1287.4",1287,[122,1339,752,506]]]'>¶ 20 Fourth, there is no doubt that the entry was peaceable as the garage door was open. And fifth, like the entry in <em>Dommel, </em>although it was dark when Officer Ross entered the garage, he did so without surprise to Appellant. Officer Ross, who arrived at the scene in a marked police car and in full uniform, only entered the garage after first knocking on the front door and receiving no response.</p>
    <p id="b1287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1287.5",1287,[121,1871,754,506]]]'>¶ 21 Finally, as stated above, Officer Ross had probable cause to believe that Appellant had been driving under the influence. The evidence necessary to establish a defendant’s guilt of this offense is a blood alcohol content test. As this Court stated in <em>Dommel, </em>there is a high likelihood that this evidence would be destroyed by any number of means in the time it took the police to secure a warrant.</p>

In so holding, we are mindful that our determination “involves a balancing of the individual’s right to be free from unreasonable intrusions against the interest of society in investigating crime quickly and adequately and preventing the disappearance of evidence necessary to convict criminals.” <em>Commonwealth v. Hinkson, </em><a href="/pa-super/315/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="315 Pa. Super. 23" data-case-ids="85877" data-case-paths="/pa-super/315/0023-01">315 Pa.Super. 23</a>, <a href="/pa-super/315/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="315 Pa. Super. 23" data-case-ids="85877" data-case-paths="/pa-super/315/0023-01">461 A.2d 616</a>, 619 (1983). When we weigh the Commonwealth’s interests in investigating and prosecuting DUI offenders against an individual’s right to be free of unreasonable intrusions, we conclude that under circumstances like those present in this case, when police officers have probable cause to believe that a person is driving under the influence and are in fresh pursuit of the DUI offender, that offender cannot escape arrest and prosecution by racing home and ensconcing himself in the constitutional protections normally accorded a person’s residence. Under these facts, Appellant’s acts operated to diminish his expectation of privacy, which then became subject to police intrusion because if they otherwise were required to secure a warrant, the prosecution of Appellant would have been substantially handicapped.</p>
