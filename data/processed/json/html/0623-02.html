    <p id="b678-11" data-blocks='[["BL_678.11",678,[207,1754,751,516]]]'>In this action for specific performance of a contract to convey real estate, the plaintiff, Merle Clarke, appeals a judgment entered by the Superior Court, Cumberland County, in favor of the defendants Mr. and Mrs. Mario DiPietro. Clarke contends that the Superior Court erred by permitting the DiPietros to amend their answer after trial to add the affirmative defense of fraud. We disagree with Clarke and accordingly affirm the judgment.</p>

The property in question had a commercial garage and facilities for parking and sale of automobiles. Encouraged by these discussions, Clarke arranged to meet Mrs. DiPietro at her home on March 7, 1985, to talk with her about selling. Clarke filled out and brought with him a preprinted form contract for the sale of real estate. After some discussion, Mrs. DiPietro signed this contract.</p>
    <p id="b678-14" data-blocks='[["BL_678.14",678,[1014,419,749,424]]]'>Within a week Mr. DiPietro notified Clarke orally and later in writing that Mrs. DiPietro had changed her mind and was repudiating the contract. Mr. DiPietro also attempted to return $1,000 in earnest money Clarke had given Mrs. DiPietro at the March 7 meeting. Clarke refused to accept the repudiation and would not take back the earnest money.</p>
    <p id="b678-15" data-blocks='[["BL_678.15",678,[1011,868,749,462]]]'>On July 5, 1985, Clarke filed a complaint alleging breach of a contract to sell real estate and requesting specific performance and incidental damages. The DiPietros’ answer raised four affirmative defenses, none of which alleged fraud. One month before trial, the DiPietros amended their answer to add the additional affirmative defense that the contract did not satisfy the statute of frauds.</p>
    <p id="b678-16" data-blocks='[["BL_678.16",678,[1006,1364,751,998]]]'>The suit was tried on July 81, 1986. In accordance with the parties’ stipulation at the beginning of the trial that ambiguity and completeness of the contract were material issues, the court admitted <em>de bene </em>the DiPietros’ testimony about the negotiations that had occurred during the March 7 meeting. The DiPietros testified that at the meeting Mrs. DiPietro had expressed reluctance to sell. The property was the main source of Mr. DiPietro’s livelihood and she had misgivings about selling the property. According to the DiPietros, Clarke promised Mrs. DiPietro that, if she signed the contract he had prepared, she could unilaterally repudiate it within 30 days. Mrs. DiPietro then signed the contract, relying on this promise. In his testimony, Clarke flatly denied having made the promise. Both parties examined and cross-examined on these points.</p>
    <p id="b678-17" data-blocks='[["BL_678.17",678,[1006,2387,748,364]]]'>At the conclusion of the non-jury trial the court called counsel into chambers and suggested that the DiPietros move to amend their answer by adding the affirmative defense of fraud. The DiPietros did so, over Clarke’s objection, and the court granted the motion and entered judgment for the DiPietros.</p>

      <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>The court specifically found that Clarke had promised Mrs. DiPietro that she would have 30 days to tear up the contract if she would sign and that Mrs. DiPietro signed only because she received that promise. The court considered this “actual fraud at worst and constructive fraud at best” and declared that in the circumstances specific performance was not an appropriate equitable remedy. The court concluded that fraud had vitiated the contract and granted rescission. Clarke seasonably appealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Maine Rules of Civil Procedure require that affirmative defenses be pleaded. M.R.Civ.P. 8(c) &amp; 12(b). Fraud is an affirmative defense in an action on a contract, and if it is not raised by sufficient pleading at the trial level, it is ordinarily deemed waived. <em>Inniss v.
