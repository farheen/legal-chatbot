The precise issue is whether, in such circumstances, the card user had “apparent authority” to use the card in the context of the provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201601" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 U.S.C. §§ 1601">15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1601</a> <em>et seq. </em>(1988). We agree with the Superior Court that for thirteen of the fifteen disputed charges the matching of the signature, combined with the cardholder’s voluntary relinquishment of the card for a third party’s use, constitutes such “apparent authority” under the Act, thereby making appellant liable for the full amount of the thirteen charges. We, therefore, affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

(“Chevy Chase”) claiming he should not be held liable for certain charges credited to his Chevy Chase Visa card. Appellant voluntarily gave his credit card to a Ms. Garrett for the limited purpose of renting a car and for hotel lodging during a business trip. Appellant contacted both the car rental agency and the hotel to determine what type of authorization would be needed for Ms. Garrett to use his Visa card. Both companies informed him that he must write a letter authorizing the charges. Appellant asserts that he wrote both companies, but was unable to produce a copy of the letter to the hotel, which he contends limited his liability to $350.00.</p>

His signature apparently had worn off the back of his credit card, and Ms. Garrett signed it as “P. Stieger” rather than Paul Stieger. On thirteen of the fifteen charges in dispute, Ms. Garrett had signed the charge slip “P. Stieger,” and on the other two she signed her own name.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant has obtained a judgment against Ms. Garrett for $3200.00, but only $750.00 has been collected, and Ms. Garrett can no longer be located.

Appellant appealed to the Superior Court asserting that the charges were unauthorized under the Truth-In-Lending Act.

    <p id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[215,1433,752,1043]]]'>The essential question on appeal is whether the disputed charges were incurred by an “unauthorized user” under the Act. The statute specifically incorporates agency concepts by defining “unauthorized use” as “a use of a credit card by a person other than the cardholder who does not have actual, implied, or <em>apparent </em>authority for such use and from which the cardholder receives no benefit.” <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 1602">15 U.S.C.A. § 1602</a>(o) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em><a href="/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20226.12" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="12 C.F.R. § 226.12">12 C.F.R. § 226.12</a>(b)(1) n. 22 (stating same). Thus, our inquiry focuses on whether the relinquishment of a credit card to another for a limited purpose, which is then expanded by the user to make additional charges not authorized by the cardholder, is an “unauthorized” use under <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 1602">15 U.S.C.A. § 1602</a>(o), thereby limiting cardholder liability.

According to the majority, the merchants reasonably relied on her signature for the former because it matched the signature on the back of the card. However, there is no dispute that Stieger did not permit Garrett to sign his card; her signing of the card was an act of forgery, compounded each of the thirteen times that she signed the charge slips as “P. Stieger”. Under the common law, the principal’s liability for acts within the apparent authority of an agent is based on the merchants’ reasonable reliance on an action of the principal. That was not the case here, where the merchants relied on Garrett’s forgeries. Thus, Garrett did not have apparent authority, within the meaning of <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201643" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 1643">15 U.S.C. § 1643</a>(a), to bind Stieger for the thirteen charges that she unlawfully signed “P. Stieger.”</p>

In the furtherance of commerce through the use of agents, there are two interests to be balanced. The rales should not make it too risky for a principal to employ agents. But the rales also should not make the dealings <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>of third persons with agents so uncertain of their validity that third persons will refuse to deal with agents. The law of agency balances those interests by charging the principal only with her own acts, while demanding only that third persons behave reasonably in relying upon those acts. After those rules have been exhausted, the law places the burden of fraudulent conduct outside the scope of actual agency upon the party defrauded, whether it is the principal or a third party. That is logical, because each member of society participating in commerce is charged with looking out for his or her own interests, and when those interests are wrongfully infringed, is given the right to proceed against at least the primary wrongdoer.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[217,1077,753,1087]]]'>In my view, the majority’s opinion upsets the balance of interests in the common law of agency by making the credit cardholder bear a disproportionate share of the risk from an activity furthering commerce that clearly benefits the card issuer and the merchants who accept the card. I disagree that the cardholder is in a better position to prevent fraud by a user with limited authority, such as Garrett perpetrated in this case. As the Truth-in-Lending Act makes clear, it is the duty of the card issuer to “provide! ] a method whereby the user of such card can be identified as the person authorized to use it.” <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201643" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 1643">15 U.S.C. § 1643</a>(a)(1)(F). Currently, it appears that most card issuers rely on a combination of embossed name and a signature provided by the cardholder. If those means of identification are too easily avoided or defeated by persons intent on fraud, it would seem that it is the card issuer that bears the burden of either improving the system or absorbing the loss.</p>

The Bank denies that it had the burden, citing the “general rule” that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving his case. The Bank may be correct with respect to the general rule, but the more relevant specific rule is that the burden of proof regarding authority is on the one asserting authority, not the one denying the authority, regardless of whether the one asserting it is the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Rustler’s Steak House v.

    <p id="b546-8" data-blocks='[["BL_546.8",546,[1014,915,751,1621]]]'>Garrett signed the disputed hotel charge in her own name. Thus, even under the majority’s analysis, because the hotel would have been unreasonable in accepting the charge on Stieger’s card, there was no apparent authority. Therefore, to prevail, the Bank had to produce some evidence of Garrett’s actual authority. The only evidence of Garrett’s actual authority was Stieger’s testimony that he wrote a letter to the hotel authorizing her to charge up to $350; neither Stieger nor the Bank produced a copy of Stieger’s letter to the hotel. The Bank sought to meet its burden of proving Garrett’s authority to make charges at the hotel by using that part of Stieger’s testimony that established he had authorized her to use his credit card at the hotel, but ignoring the part of Stieger’s testimony that placed a $350 limitation on the authority to make charges over $350.00. In those circumstances, I disagree with the majority’s holding that the Bank met its burden of proving Garrett’s authority. A party may not meet its burden by taking but one portion of a statement of the opposing party, while ignoring the rest. That is little different from saying that had Stieger testified that he had <em>not </em>authorized Garrett, the trial court may credit the “authorized” part of the statement, but discredit the “not” and declare the Bank’s burden met. Moreover, the record contains nothing to indicate that the commissioner discredited anything Stieger said. Therefore, on this point at the least, the case should be remanded.</p>

He testified that merchants have often required him to prove his identity in connection with his use of his own credit card. He testified that his own investigation of local merchants disclosed that several never honor credit cards presented by one other than the cardholder, and that of the remainder, all but one require a written authorization.
