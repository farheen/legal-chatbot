      <a id="p1484" href="#p1484" data-label="1484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1484</a>The McCormick affidavit is that of one who is skilled in the relevant art. He states as a <em>fact </em>that the prior art had tried to blend a small amount of polyethylene with a hydrocarbon wax. This <em>fact </em>is further evidenced by the disclosure of the bfewberg patent. McCormick notes that one of the technical problems encountered in such polyethylene-wax blends arose from the <em>fact </em>that the molecular weight of polyethylene in the blend is higher than that of either paraffinic or microcrystalline wax. Appellant’s specification also points out as a <em>fact </em>that the waxes generally have molecular weights of about 360 to 700 while the polyethylene used generally have molecular weights ranging between from about 5000 to 20,000. As a result of this disparity between the molecular weights of the wax and polyethylene components of the blend, McCormick state as a <em>fact </em>that there is a tendency for the polyethylene micelles to agglomerate and separate out of the blend, pointing out that the higher molecular fractions contained in the polyethylene separate out first. In these blends, as McCormick points out, the hydrocarbon wax acts as a solvent for the polyethylene.</p>
    <p id="b824-4" data-blocks='[["BL_824.4",824,[210,1175,1325,560]]]'>The McCormick affidavit also mentions as a <em>fact </em>a number of problems presented to the art by the tendency of the polyethylene to separate from the blend. Some of these are: storage problems, particularly with respect to temperature; the tendency of the polyethylene micelles to stratify during storage; and the resultant unsatisfactory operation of the coating machines when operated with such blends. One approach of the prior art to the solution of these problems, McCormick points out, was to experiment with the production of polyethylene as regards its molecular weight, its molecular weight range, and its melt index to make it more nearly compatible with the wax component. As McCormick stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b824-5" data-blocks='[["BL_824.5",824,[209,1761,1324,370]]]'>* * * Moreover, experimentation was carried out as regards the quantity of the polyethylene used in the blend and further research involved experimentation in connection with the techniques of blending, handling, packaging and shipping as well as the techniques used in the coating operation and the kind and quality of paper stock employed. * * * Attempts to employ chemical cross linking agents were unfruitful and this likewise was the case in connection with attempts to treat the wax or the polyethylene, or both, so as to reduce the falling out tendency of the polyethylene from the wax-polyethylene blends under operating and storage conditions consistent with safe handling.</blockquote>

These <em>factual </em>inquiries bear upon the issue of obviousness before us. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere </em>Co., supra. The examiner and the board dismissed the McCormick affidavit as presenting but the “opinion” of one skilled in the art with respect to the application of the prior art. The Jones affidavit fared little better despite its <em>factual </em>showing of tests that blends irradiated, as taught by appellant, were more stable in storage and in use than <em>"blends </em>not so treated.
