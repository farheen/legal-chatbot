Virginia has a category of homicide known as capital murder, for which the penalty is death or imprisonment for life. Va.Code §§ 18.2-31, 18.2-10(a) (1990). First degree murder, the second most severe form of homicide, carries a penalty of imprisonment for life or for a period of no less than twenty years. <em><a href="/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%201035" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="95 L.

Even if the declaration truly reflects earlier legislative intent, (which may or may not reflect the intent of the Mayor in signing, and the Congress in not vetoing the legislation), it appears to be intended to affect judicial review. I have no reason to believe that the motives behind the 1989 Council declaration were not entirely honorable. It is not difficult, however, to imagine that a legislative body on some other occasion— confronted by a public outcry against a trial court decision interpreting ambiguous legislation to create a very unpopular right — could conveniently, and retroactively, find an intent that had never been thought of, let alone declared, at the time of enactment, and thereby cause erasure of what the reviewing court otherwise, using appropriate interpretive tools, might have found to be a newly established right. The analysis Judge SCHWELB employs here could apply to that kind of situation as well. From that perspective, a speedy postenactment reaction by a legislature comprised mostly of members who had voted on the earlier enactment could appear to be primarily an effort to protect the legislators’ own interests at the polls, rather than to reflect their earlier intention — or more likely their earlier lack of intention — applicable to the issue later presented.</p>

    <p id="b650-6" data-blocks='[["BL_650.7",650,[201,1454,755,732]]]'>I am in complete accord with the reasoning of Judge Green in <em>Cunningham v. Williams, </em>711 P.Supp. 644 (D.D.C.1989), that the plain language and the purpose of the Good Time Credits Act of 1986, coupled with the rules of “lenity” and logic, compel the conclusion that every person then convicted and imprisoned in the District of Columbia who engaged in conforming conduct, was entitled to receive the benefits of that legislation (with one specifically noted exception).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">21</a> Indeed, I find much of the analysis employed by my colleague, Judge Schwelb, to add further support to, rather than to detract from, the result reached by Judge Green.</p>

I agree with Judge Ferren, therefore, that in the circumstances of this case, it would be judicially inappropriate for us to credit the 1989 Council declaration of the 1986 Council’s intent. We can no more determine the “subjective” intent of an earlier legislature than can a subsequent legislature. That is why Judge Green in <em>Cunningham </em>was correct in starting with the fundamental canon of the plain language of the GTC Act of 1986 and giving conclusive weight to that language.</p>
    <p id="b650-10" data-blocks='[["BL_650.12",650,[1004,728,754,1185]]]'>Moreover, because we are here dealing with legislation which affects the length of criminal sentences, I believe it is also (constitutionally speaking) hazardous to “borrow” (as Judge Ferren has done) from the “general and specific” canons of civil statutory construction to here make the Murder I statute uniquely paramount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">22</a> The question is not whether there is a “counter-canon” of statutory construction that would prevent the application of Judge Fer-ren’s approach, but whether the approach can be lawfully applied to these penal provisions. Through the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition of the Constitution, “the Framers sought to assure that legislative Acts give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed.” Two critical elements identify an <em>ex post facto </em>law: it must be retrospective and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. <em>Id. </em>at 580. The alteration of credits given as a matter of grace to prison inmates who abide by prison rules may fall within its prohibition.</p>
