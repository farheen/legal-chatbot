Respondent contends that in arriving at this recommendation, the Board failed to consider findings of fact made by the Hearing Committee that weighed in favor of a less severe sanction. Respondent also argues that the recommended sanction is more severe than the punishments imposed by the Board and this court for similar conduct in previous eases. Finally, respondent contends that the Board and this court are without authority to consider prior disciplinary violations in determining appropriate sanctions in a pending matter. We adopt the Board’s recommendation.</p>
    <p id="b512-15" data-blocks='[["BL_512.16",512,[987,659,752,1408]]]'>The misconduct in this case arose out of respondent’s representation of Lonnie Turner and Janice Grant in an action they brought against a music recording company for breach of an employment contract. Respondent was charged with: (1) neglecting the Turner/Grant case and failing to seek the lawful objectives of his clients in violation of DR 6-101(A)(2) and DR 7-101(A)(1) and (3); (2) making misrepresentations to the court in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) and DR 7-102(A)(5) and misrepresentations to his clients also in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4); and (3) making false statements to the Board and impugning the reputation of the presiding judge in the Turner/Grant litigation in violation of DR 1-102(A)(5). Following two days of eviden-tiary hearings, the Hearing Committee concluded that only the misrepresentation charges had been proven. The Committee discredited the testimony of the complaining witnesses, Turner and Grant, in finding that the remaining charges were without merit. While the Board recommended a harsher sanction than that sought by the Committee for the misrepresentation violation, it adopted the Committee’s conclusion that the other charges had not been proven. We also agree with that determination.</p>

The first misrepresentation was made in a “Motion for Continuance of Pre-trial” filed on April 2, 1980, in which respondent requested postponement “because of his inability to contact <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>his clients to discuss matters that pertain to the pre-trial statement.” Respondent’s assertion that Turner and Grant were out of the jurisdiction during much of the pretrial period was rejected by the Committee as “baseless.” The Committee pointed to testimony of respondent in which he indicated that he had numerous conferences and telephone conversations with his clients during this period.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[201,753,748,645]]]'>The second misrepresentation was made in a “Motion for Continuance of Trial” filed on April 10,1980. Respondent represented in that filing that “plaintiffs do not at this time have the money for bringing witnesses to trial in Washington” and that “plaintiffs have had difficulty in -ecuring [sic] all of their documents for trial.” The Committee found, and the Board again agreed, that respondent’s lack of preparedness was primarily related not to difficulties in securing documents and financing witnesses, but, rather, to respondent’s procrastination in acting on these matters.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[200,1420,747,984]],["BL_513.6",513,[1003,276,748,180]]]'>The final misrepresentation was made in a post-trial “Opposition to a Motion to Set Aside the Awarding of Attorney’s Fees.” Opposing counsel in the Turner/Grant case had urged the court to set aside the award because of respondent’s pretrial failures to comply with discovery and deadlines listed in the pretrial order. In his opposition, respondent asserted that “compliance with the [pretrial] order of the court was impossible by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs who possessed all of the records left the area and did not return until a day prior to trial.” Again citing respondent’s testimony in which he stated that he had numerous conversations with his clients prior to trial, the Committee found that there was no truth to the assertion that Turner and Grant were not in the jurisdiction during the pretrial period. The Committee found further that the record did not support the assertion that the clients’ possession of records prevented respondent from complying with the pretrial order. The Board adopted these findings.</p>

The Board, however, focused on respondent’s prior disciplinary record in recommending a suspension of three months. At that time, he had previously been informally admonished by Bar Counsel for failing to carry out a contract of employment and was publicly reprimanded in 1979 by a state court in Virginia for falsifying the mailing date of a paper filed with the court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In light of the similarity between the latter violation and those at issue in this proceeding, the Board was of the view that a stronger sanction was needed to make it clear that misrepresentations to courts in this jurisdiction will not be tolerated.

Specifically, respondent argues that the Board failed to consider the Committee’s finding that Turner and Grant lacked credibility.

    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[198,524,755,983]]]'>The fatal flaw in respondent’s argument is that a review of the findings indicates that both the Committee and the Board concluded that the misrepresentations were knowingly made. In its report, the Committee stated: “In sum, the Committee concludes that the three quoted statements were <em>knowing misrepresentations.” </em>In its report, the Board stated: “The record establishes that respondent <em>knowingly </em>made false statements in three separate pleadings submitted . to the Court.” Thus, while it is true that the Board did not refer to the Committee’s finding on credibility in its report,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> it is clear that there was agreement that the misrepresentations were knowingly made.

In <em>In re Molovinsky, </em>M-31-79 (D.C. August 23, 1979), the respondent misrepresented to the court his reason for failing to appear in court on time and was publicly censured as a result.
