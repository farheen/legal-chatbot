As the designated petitioner before this Court, PBC argues, in its cross-petition for review, that the Board abused its discretion in denying PBC attorney fees and penalty interest since Section 3935 of the Commonwealth Procurement Code (Procurement Code), 62 Pa.C.S. § 3935, expressly permits such an award, and DGS engaged in arbitrary and vexatious conduct within the meaning of the Code. In its petition for review, DGS asserts the Board committed several legal errors in interpreting the contract, lacked jurisdiction over a portion of PBC’s claim, and capriciously disregarded substantial evidence regarding actual weather conditions which served as a basis for DGS’s decision to suspend the project.</p>

In September 2003, PBC entered into a general Construction Contract (Contract) with DGS for the construction of the Pennsylvania National Guard Readiness Center, a one-story armory building on a 22-acre site in Con-nellsville, Fayette County. PBC issued a subcontract to Five-R Excavating, Inc. (Five-R) to perform site work pursuant to DGS specifications. On October 10, 2003, DGS issued to PBC a notice to proceed with a ten-month completion time. PBC issued a revised project schedule on November 11, 2003, with subsequent approval by all other prime contractors one week later. According to the bid documents, the project consisted of a balanced site, where materials from higher elevations may be utilized to fill lower elevations without the need for borrowing fill outside the site for excavation purposes.</p>
    <p id="b1010-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1010.13",1010,[1002,870,753,1388]]]'>After an unforeseen 5-day delay due to efforts to obtain a building permit, PBC and Five-R commenced the initial work on October 15, 2003. On November 4, 2003, PBC and Five-R started the cut and fill excavation operations when they encountered soil with excessive moisture. Unsuccessfully, Five-R attempted to dry out the soil in order to meet the compaction requirements. After two weeks of attempts, PBC notified DGS of the delay due to “weather and soil conditions,” and that they had ceased work at the site. (Board Op., Findings of Fact (FOF) ¶20.) In response, DGS directed PBC to continue working. (FOF ¶ 21.) After a request by DGS, the design professional for the project, Valentour English Bodnar <em>&amp; </em>Howell (VEBH), provided several alternatives which included suspending the project, utilizing shale, or importing crushed stone to achieve the fill. DGS rejected the latter two of these alternatives due to cost concerns and, instead, decided to wait for warmer weather so the soil could be air-dried to meet the specifications. (FOF ¶¶ 24-25.)</p>

In response, PBC disagreed with DGS’s contention that any incurred additional costs would not be compensable and claimed, among other things, that the suspension was one of convenience under Article 12.3<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of the General Conditions, entitling PBC to additional costs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On March 24, 2004, the entities held a meeting at which PBC, Five-R, and VEBH expressed their concern to DGS over soil conditions and discussed the need for better weather conditions, an extended suspension, or an alternate plan. (FOF ¶¶ 35-37.) DGS, however, ended the suspension on April 9, 2004, and directed PBC to recommence work by April 15, 2004. (FOF ¶ 38.) Five days later, DGS issued a time extension on the project and set the completion date to January 10, 2005. (FOF ¶ 39.) DGS again refused to make any additional payment to PBC for costs due to the suspension. (FOF ¶ 40.)</p>
    <p id="b1011-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1011.6",1011,[987,273,754,1051]]]'>When PBC and Five-R recommenced excavation, they “expended significant labor and equipment hours ... to air dry the wet soil” without success. (FOF ¶ 42.) In May 2004, when soil conditions worsened, Five-R utilized the soil from the adjacent parking lot, an on-site borrow area, for fill. PBC then ordered a study of the parking lot soil and discovered “a large amount of highly plastic clay and other clayey soils.” (FOF ¶¶ 43-44.) DGS specifications dictated that this particular type of soil would be <em>unsuitable </em>for fill regardless of any time spent air-drying. (FOF ¶ 44.) In contrast, the information provided by DGS during the bidding process noted the presence of clay and other soil types on site, but stated that all soil on site <em>could be used </em>for fill and that some of the soil may require some air-drying. (FOF ¶ 45.)</p>

After VEBH created a scope of work report and both PBC and Five-R submitted cost details, DGS directed PBC to proceed on June 18, 2004, “but that all eost[s] would be assumed by PBC.” (FOF ¶ 50; <em>see </em>Letter from Martin Bar-key, DGS’s Western Regional Director, to <a id="p978" href="#p978" data-label="978" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*978</a>Greg Miller, PBC, June 18, 2004, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 1294a.)

(Letter from Christopher R. Opalinski, PBC’s Legal Counsel, to James P. Creedon, DGS’s Deputy Secretary for Public Works, Feb. 6, 2004, R.R. at 1170a.) Article 12.4 allows for damages when DGS suspends the project for “an unreasonable period of time.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> DGS did not respond to this claim, and on June 21, 2004, PBC filed a Statement of Claim with the Board against DGS.

The Board found no credible evidence that PBC engaged in “taking undue risk of damage to any part of a structure or installation” within the meaning of Article 12.1 to justify a suspension under this provision. (Board Op. at 26.) The Board interpreted the term “structure or installation” to refer to those that are currently in existence, not future structures or installations. (Board Op. at 27.) Since the site did not contain any existing structures or installations, PBC could not have taken any undue risk of damage, and according to the Board, Article 12.1 fails to provide ade<a id="p979" href="#p979" data-label="979" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*979</a>quate grounds justifying the five-month suspension.</p>

The Board recognized that a suspension for convenience under Article 12.3 does not provide for explicit damages, but a suspension for an unreasonable period of time under Article 12.4 does, in fact, permit a cost adjustment. To reconcile this inconsistency, the Board viewed “any suspension of work ordered by DGS merely for its convenience and not otherwise justified by a provision of Article 12 to be ‘unreasonable’ or ‘for an unreasonable period of time’ as to the contractor and com-pensable pursuant to [Article] 12.4.” (Board Op. at 29.)</p>

It concluded that “PBC did not have the time to do its own geotechnical report during the bid process,” and PBC should not have discovered the problem on its own. (Board Op. at BO-31.) Ultimately, the Board agreed with the “overwhelming weight of testimony” that the EMI Report failed to accurately reveal the extent of clayey soils and the subsurface seeps and springs. (Board Op. at 31.) Also, while recognizing the cause of the soil moisture condition as a close factual question, the Board found the “highly plastic, clayey character of the soils and the significant underground seeps and springs on site ... were the underlying cause for the compaction problems.” (Board Op. at 32.) The Board specifically rejected DGS’s assertion of rainy weather as the cause since DGS failed to explain why the adjacent hillside, which PBC later used to solve the compaction problem, remained unaffected by the condition.</p>

The memo incorporated a report identifying a significant presence of clayey materials and concluded with a “refreshingly frank assessment that the site is unsuitable for earthwork in winter and early spring.” (Board Op. at 33.) Based on DGS’s withholding the memo, the Board found the EMI Report, by itself, to be a material misrepresentation and held that DGS engaged in constructive fraud, breach of contract, and active interference with PBC’s performance of its contractual duties. (Board Op. at 34.) In response to DGS’s argument that PBC is liable for the costs of importing and exporting fill under the Contract, the Board found these provisions to be unbalanced and ambiguous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> (Board Op. at 37.) Constru<a id="p980" href="#p980" data-label="980" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*980</a>ing these provisions against DGS as the drafter, the Board held DGS responsible for the additional costs.

While PBC filed its Supplemental Claim with DGS three days after PBC filed its Statement of Claim with the Board, the Board did not consider this timing issue fatal. The Board noted that over 120 days passed since PBC filed its Supplemental Claim, so the absence of a response by DGS deems the claim denied.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Further, paragraph 15 of the State<a id="p981" href="#p981" data-label="981" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*981</a>ment of Claim specifically puts DGS on notice about PBC’s Supplemental Claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In the end, the Board found this aspect of PBC’s claim “was placed before the Board upon the expiration of 120 days from the day PBC filed this supplemental claim with [DGS].” (Board Op. at 42.)</p>

DGS notes that the Board’s attempt to incorporate the Supplemental Claim into PBC’s Statement of Claim filed with the Board three days earlier fails because the purpose behind Section 1712.1 is to give the contracting officer an opportunity to resolve the claim before filing with the Board. Section 1712.1 requires PBC to file a claim with DGS first, and only 15 days after the denial of the claim (or 135 days after the claim is filed in the absence of any determination) may PBC file a statement of claim with the Board. PBC did not make a claim for subsurface conditions (i.e., Supplemental Claim) until after the Statement of Claim was filed with the Board.

PBC maintains that it timely presented the Supplemental Claim to DGS, and PBC expressly incorporated the Supplemental Claim in the original Statement of Claim, which PBC timely filed with the Board. PBC claims that DGS first raised this jurisdictional argument in post-hearing briefing, after it clearly recognized this portion of PBC’s claim during the course of the hearing. Moreover, PBC asserts that its Statement of Claim included both the suspension component, which PBC filed with DGS on February 6, 2004, and the unsuitable soil component, i.e., Supplemental Claim, as constituting PBC’s damages claim. Regarding the unsuitable soil, Paragraph 15 of the Statement of Claim clearly addresses the unsuitable soil claim in the Supplemental Claim. Lastly, PBC denies that DGS suffered any prejudice by PBC’s not amending the Statement of Claim because DGS knew of the Supplemental Claim pri- or to and during the course of the hearing. As the Board recognized, PBC notes the purpose behind Section 1712.1 is to provide DGS notice of the claim and the opportunity to accept or reject the claim. Here, PBC argues that it accomplished both because PBC provided notice to DGS when it filed the Statement of Claim and the Supplemental Claim, giving DGS the opportunity to respond, though DGS never did.

While PBC filed the Statement of Claim before it filed the Supplemental Claim, the Statement of Claim is still considered timely as PBC technically filed it within 135 days of the deemed denial under Section 1712.1(e). PBC need not have filed another statement of claim as a follow up to the Supplemental Claim since Paragraph 15 of the original Statement of Claim sufficiently placed DGS on notice regarding the Supplemental Claim.

Moreover, while PBC testified that it would not have continued with the construction if deemed unsafe, DGS maintains that the Contract would demand otherwise; if PBC did not continue, it would have been in breach of the Contract unless DGS authorized a suspension under the Contract.

The suspension, PBC claims, could have been avoided if DGS accepted one or more of the recommendations posited by its own professionals. Lastly, PBC notes that to interpret the word “installation” as a verb, per DGS’s suggestion, would not make any grammatical sense. An the Board found, no other significant work could proceed until the cut and fill operation was completed. (FOF ¶ 13.)

The Board found PBC did not take any undue risk at all and, in fact, halted operations when it first discovered the unsuitability of the soil. (FOF ¶¶ 20, 60, 71; Board Op. at 26.) It began operations again <em>only </em>at the insistence of DGS. (FOF ¶¶ 21, 38.) The Board also found that DGS failed to exercise good faith when it determined that PBC took undue risk to a structure or installation and suspended the project. (FOF ¶ 62.) Under this provision, in order for DGS to direct a suspension, PBC must be affirmatively taking steps to put the project in jeopardy. As reflected in the Board’s findings, no such circumstance occurred here, where PBC exercised caution and prudence in its duties and only continued with operations after DGS rejected alternatives and ordered PBC to continue work after it had stopped. (FOF ¶¶ 37-38; Board Op. at 22.) DGS may not, after the fact, order a retroactive suspension of operations, when PBC has already stopped excavation work, and then claim PBC subjected the project to “undue risk.”</p>

DGS maintains that it did not make any affirmative representations to PBC with regard to the soil conditions which would justify a finding of constructive fraud. DGS notes a provision of the Contract in which PBC “assume[s] all risk in excavating for this project and shall not be entitled to rely on any subsurface information obtained from [DGS’s geotechnical expert.]” (DGS’s Br. at 17 (citing Contract Section 02300, Part I, ¶ 1.7A, R.R. at 597a).)

Moreover, DGS asserts that its withholding of the August 1999 memo does not constitute constructive fraud or active interference because both doctrines require an affirmative <em>act </em>or a material failure to <em>act. </em>Failing to provide the memo, according to DGS, did not amount to either.</p>

(PBC’s Second Br. at 22; FOF ¶ 75.) PBC asserts that DGS misrepresented the conditions of the project when it knew of the futility of commencing work and directed PBC to start anyway.

PBC claims that while Section 1.7A and Section 3.8G forbid reliance on the geo-technical report and place the burden on PBC to acquire extra fill respectively, Section 1.7B allows PBC to rely on the boring logs, and Section 1.7F provides for compensation regarding design changes due to unanticipated conditions, which occurred here.

For example, as the Board recognized, Article 10.8 seemingly provides for a cost adjustment regarding concealed conditions, yet Section 1.4A defined concealed conditions so narrowly as to effectively negate any meaning to Article 10.8. Further, Section 1.7A mandates that PBC assume the risk for subsurface conditions, but Section 1.7F states the exact opposite — that the EMI Report cannot reveal all subsurface conditions and any substantial variance will result in a cost credit. These provisions are in place notwithstanding Section 3.8G’s command to place the burden on PBC to obtain additional fill. Contrary to DGS’s position, the cited provisions are anything but clear, and they poorly allocate the risk between the parties, especially in this circumstance where the allocation of risk in a significant government construction project is vital to ensure the containment of costs.</p>

PBC maintains that Section 3935 simply permits a recovery of attorney fees when a party withholds payment contrary to the contract in bad faith. PBC finds no basis to treat one category of contract payments differently from another in Section 3935. Further, PBC claims the Board ruled against the weight of the evidence and inconsistent with its own findings of fact when it found that DGS did not act in an arbitrary and vexatious manner. Citing, among other things, the August 1999 memo and the Board’s finding of constructive fraud, PBC asserts that the record clearly establishes the arbitrary and vexatious conduct by DGS.

Further, as the Board found, the withholding of the August 1999 memo constituted a material misrepresentation of the site conditions. Also, considering the findings of constructive fraud and active interference, the facts here support a legal conclusion of vexatious conduct by DGS as it did not have sufficient grounds in either law or fact in withholding payment for costs related to the five-month suspension and unsuitable soil conditions. We will, therefore, reverse the Board’s order as to its denial of penalty interest and attorney fees under Section 3935 only and remand for a proper determination of penalty interest and attorney fees due to PBC.</p>

Initially, we note that the Board erred in holding that Section 3935 only applied to progress payment due under a contract. As PBC argues correctly, and with no responding contrary argument by DGS, the statutory text of Section 3935 does not support a finding that its reach is limited to progress payments. In fact, both subsections (a) and (b) of Section 3935 allow the recovery of penalty interest and attorney fees for wrongly withheld payments that are generally due "under this subchapter.” 62 Pa.C.S. § 3935. Section 3935 is found under Subchapter D— Prompt Payment Schedules. Also under Sub-chapter D, 62 Pa.C.S. § 3932(a) mandates “the government agency shall pay the contractor ... strictly in accordance with the contract," without any qualification, while subsections (b) and (c) of Section 3932 discuss progress payments. In short, because we find no limiting language in Section 3935 that would suggest a narrow application, the penalty and attorney fees provisions of Section 3935 applies in this instance.</p>
