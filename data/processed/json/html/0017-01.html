Our response uniformly has been rejection of this appeal, primarily for two reasons: first, because compliance with the licensing requirement by a qualified contractor is a simple administrative matter; and second, because anything but an unyielding rule would put temptation in the way of unqualified (and unscrupulous) contractors and invite recurrence of the same abuses that underlay enactment of the regulatory scheme. <em>See, e.g., Bathroom Design Inst., </em><a href="/a2d/317/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="317 A.2d 526" data-case-ids="8046798" data-case-paths="/a2d/317/0526-01">317 A.2d at 529</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In short, potential unfair applications of the rule at the margins have not persuaded us to sacrifice the benefits of a clear-cut, unmistakable requirement, with equally clear consequences for noncompliance, in this area of consumer protection.</p>

Second, Cevern eventually — indeed, shortly after being certified by the Department investigator — did obtain the license, and argues that denying it payment for work performed thereafter is a <em>reductio ad absur-dum </em>of the rule barring even quasi-contractual recovery.

In <em>Capital Constr. Co., </em>for example, the court required the contractor to disgorge progress payments accepted after its license had lapsed or expired before completion of the work. One assumes, since the contractor still possessed the license at most a few months before it accepted progress payments,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> that at the time it violated the regulation it was in compliance with some if not all of the other licensing requisites; yet this was unavailing.

If revenue-raising were the only purpose for issuance of the license as such, much the same end could be achieved by a tax or professional fee. To the contrary, common sense suggests the regulatory importance of the certificate of license itself as the final, formal evidence that the contractor has met the licensing requirements. Others, most particularly but not only the homeowner contracted with, should be able to look to it for simple and sufficient proof of qualification under the regulations, rather than having to inquire of agency officials whether the contractor has substantially (or even wholly) completed the certification process.</p>

Most of the work Cevern performed was done after it had obtained its license. Nevertheless, in the name of an “unyielding rule” of its own making, the majority holds that Cevern is entitled to nothing for the effort and resources it expended in performing the contract, even for work performed after it was licensed. To my mind, that unyielding rule not only leads to an unjust result in this case, but also is unnecessary to accomplish the regulatory purposes of the licensing requirement. I believe our job is not to lay down unyielding rules but to decide individual eases on their own merits. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>

On the other hand, I can see a real interest to be protected on the side of the home improvement contractor in this case which, like many other such contractors, is a small business. To make one suffer a forfeiture in a particular case in the name of some theoretical protection for other consumers is precisely the sort of rigidity that gives government regulation a bad name. If the express language of the controlling statute or regulations, or our prior case law, required such result, our hands would be tied. But, notwithstanding the majority’s assertion to the contrary, that is not the case here. Neither the applicable legislation nor prior case law compel the majority’s result.

The majority suggests that the actual licensing certificate is an important document that permits persons, such as homeowners, to ascertain the contractor's qualifications. <em>Ante </em>at 20-21. That argument does not make sense to me. I can conceive that it may be in the <em>contractor's </em>interest to have the license in the event that a prospective customer requests proof of responsibility. Were a homeowner concerned about a contractor’s licensing status before entering into a contract, the contractor could use it as proof. If a contractor in Cevern’s situation were to reply that it was "all but licensed,” either the homeowner could disbelieve the assertion and not enter into the contract, or believe it and enter into it. Either the contractor was lying or he was telling the truth. If he was telling the truth, then the homeowner is protected and no harm accrues to him. If he was lying, the homeowner won’t be liable to the contractor and may in fact get restitution of the advance. In either case, the homeowner is fully protected.</p>
