That process is fixed by the constitutional provision to which you have referred. In brief, the enactment process requires the participation of both the Executive and the Legislative Branches. Indeed, Article III, Section 18 requires that every bill passed by both Houses “shall, before it becomes law, be presented to the Governor,” who then has a choice about what to do with it. The Governor can:</p>
    <blockquote id="b761-6" data-blocks='[["BL_761.6",761,[225,1651,708,86]]]'>(a) sign it within 10 days (if he does so, the bill becomes law); or</blockquote>

    <p id="b761-10" data-blocks='[["BL_761.9",761,[984,531,748,761]]]'>Both (a) and (b) are choices which the Governor alone controls, that is, the Governor may sign a bill presented to him, or he may ignore it; the choice is his. But the Governor does not control (c) because he cannot return a bill to the House in which it originated if the General Assembly has finally adjourned. And that is where the so-called “pocket veto” is pertinent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Section 18 provides, in effect, that if the General Assembly deprives the Governor of choice (c) by a final <em>adjournment </em>— m the words of the Constitution, if the General Assembly “prevent its return” — then the bill “shall not become a law without the approval of the Governor.”</p>

Its purpose, rather, is to protect the Governor’s participation in the enactment process, which is a species of power-balancing between the two Branches, and as long as the Governor may exercise that power as to a specific bill, there is not a need for nor a right to exercise a pocket veto. And the Governor has such power (that is, to return <a id="p698" href="#p698" data-label="698" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*698</a>a bill) at any time before “final adjournment” of the General Assembly.

    <p id="b762-5" data-blocks='[["BL_762.5",762,[204,949,751,701]]]'>Thus, the General Assembly is always in session for “veto purposes”, until “final adjournment.” Knowing with certainty when that event has occurred is of great importance because “inaction” by the Governor has different consequences — indeed, precisely opposite consequences — depending on whether such inaction is before or after final adjournment. If it is <em>before </em>final adjournment, then a bill presented to the Governor becomes “a law in like manner as if he had signed it.” Article III, Section 18. If it is <em>after </em>that event, then a bill presented to the Governor does <em>not </em>become law <em>unless </em>he signs it.</p>

It thus follows, since two regular sessions are now required by Article II, Section 4, that ‘final adjournment’ of the General Assembly means the adjournment <em>sine die </em>of the second regular session, or, in the absence of such adjournment, the ex-tinguishment of the particular General Assembly by reason of expiration of the terms of office of the members, whichever is earlier in point of time.”</blockquote>

We advise that it did not. Several reasons sustain our advisory view.</p>
    <p id="b762-11" data-blocks='[["BL_762.10",762,[1005,1613,743,132]]]'>First, the 1969 Amendment does not expressly speak to “final adjournment of the General Assembly” at all.</p>

    <p id="b762-13" data-blocks='[["BL_762.14",762,[1006,2252,743,319]],["BL_763.1",763,[181,317,748,227]]]'>Third, the language of the 1969 Amendment would seem to foreclose the conclusion that the draftsmen intended to affect the concept of “final adjournment of the General Assembly.” In particular, it is provided that “each session shall not extend beyond the last day of June unless <em>the session </em>is <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>recalled by the Governor or the mutual call of the presiding officers of both Houses.” (Emphasis added).

See 54 <em>Del.Laws, </em>Ch. 11 and sixth footnote herein, <em>supra. </em>That Amendment clearly contemplates one “final adjournment” as distinguished from other adjournments or recesses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The session “shall not extend beyond the last day of June” unless certain procedures are followed. Thus, the General Assembly by operation of law, is required to stop its session at midnight on June 30th annually and it cannot continue by Legislative initiative unless “the session is recalled by the mutual call of the presiding officers of both Houses.” It is intended by this constitutional provision that the General Assembly should finish its business by June 30th and, if it does not, the sole Legislative power to recall “the session” rests jointly with the presiding officers of the two Houses. But there is nothing expressly stated in the 1969 Amendment which places any limitation on the duration of a recalled session. Nor does the 1969 Amendment expressly limit the subject matter that can be considered at a <a id="p700" href="#p700" data-label="700" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*700</a>recall of the session.
