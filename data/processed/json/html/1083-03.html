Appellant contends this led to the erroneous conclusion the Commonwealth exercised the requisite due diligence by virtue of the Rule 130 filing. Appellant claims the Rule 130 consolidation was for judicial economy only, and any finding it served as joinder or consolidation of two separate criminal complaints was improper. Appellant correctly asserts the Commonwealth failed to comply with Rule 582, and thus, the trial court did not engage in a joinder analysis.
