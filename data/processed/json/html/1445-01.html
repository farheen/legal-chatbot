It is noted that, when ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was used, “The coating solidified but did not wet the polyethylene” and that “a readily peelable coating was formed.” The parties agree that no graft copolymer was formed in this example. Other examples specifically refer to the product of irradiation of p-divinyl benzene and of styrene as graft copolymers. (A claim directed to the latter was allowed.) Examples are also given <a id="p1452" href="#p1452" data-label="1452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1452</a>of the irradiation of about half a dozen other monomers without any reference to the formation of graft copolymers.

Consequently, the Board properly concluded that the disclosure would be considered adequate as to those monomers actually shown by the examples (or otherwise in the original disclosure) to form graft cross-linked copolymers with the polyethylene * * * but inadequate as to any other monomers or the very broad category of “polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon monomers”, which include monomers such as vinyl acetylene not even mentioned in the appellants’ catalog of monomers.</blockquote>
    <p id="b792-5" data-blocks='[["BL_792.5",792,[226,977,1328,347]]]'>The thrust of the inadequate disclosure rejection is that appellants have claimed more broadly than they have invented. It is maneuvered into the shadow, at least, of section 112 by the observation that the specification gives no indication whether these monomers for which there is no specific example will behave on irradiation like styrene, which forms a graft copolymer, or like ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, which does not.</p>

In chemical cases, important considerations include the type of reactions, the state of the art, the representative nature of the examples, and the breadth of the claims.

    <p id="b792-7" data-blocks='[["BL_792.7",792,[226,1692,1329,337]]]'>The present case is unusual in that appellants’ specification is the evidence of its own inadequacy. The board properly relied upon it. We think the board properly rejected claims 9-11 for inadequate disclosure. Each of those claims includes several polyallyl esters. But the only polyallyl ester whose irradiation is reported did not form a graft copolymer. We, therefore, affirm the rejection of claims 9-11.</p>

(Claim 57 is quoted above.) These claims are said by appellants to be drawn to those classes of compounds for which working examples were provided. The board did not agree that working examples had been provided. Apparently because of inconsistency in the specification, the board refused to infer the production of graft copolymers in the examples of polyethylene-monomer irradiation. We feel that a fair reading of the specification as a whole demands such an inference. The specification states, as the introduction to its <a id="p1453" href="#p1453" data-label="1453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1453</a>catalog of monomers, that “it is often possible to employ grafted polymers.” It then gives examples of monomer irradiation, making clear in one example that a graft copolymer was not formed. It seems clear to us that the specification as a whole implies the production of graft copolymers in each example where there is no contrary indication. We therefore reverse the rejection of claims 57-59 on the ground of inadequate disclosure.</p>

We have recently emphasized the importance of the identity of the records when the preclusive effect of earlier litigation between the same parties is urged. <em>In re Herr, </em>supra.
