A jury found that the lawyer’s failure constituted a breach of a third party beneficiary contract and awarded damages to the would-be beneficiary. The trial court denied post-trial motions, and judgment was entered on the verdict. After careful review, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b1016-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1016.17",1016,[960,813,752,1004]]]'>Carl Lindsay, Esquire, is a member of the Pennsylvania Bar and has practiced law in Bucks County for many years. In 1979, he drafted a will for Arthur Blain, in which Phyllis Murphy, a friend, was named as sole beneficiary and executrix. This will was duly executed. In November, 1984, Blain was admitted to the Doylestown Hospital, where he was confined to the Intensive Care Unit following a double femoral bypass. While there, Blain was visited by his longtime friend, James Gregg. According to Gregg’s subsequent testimony, he raised with Blain the matter of a will; and after some discussion, Blain directed him to contact Lindsay and have him draft a new will making a substantial bequest to Gregg and also naming Gregg as executor. Aso to be included in the will were bequests in favor of the Bucks County SPCA and St. Aban’s Episcopal Church of Syracuse, New York.</p>
    <p id="b1016-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1016.18",1016,[958,1857,751,467]]]'>Thereafter, Gregg called Lindsay and told him that Blain was in the Intensive Care Unit, was in serious condition, and desired a new will which was to be drafted and executed the same day. To emphasize the need for haste, but without any authority from Blain, Gregg told Lindsay that if a new will could not be drafted and executed the same day, he, Gregg, would find another lawyer to do the job.</p>

Lindsay testified that Blain seemed to be unconcerned about the document but did say that the revised will was acceptable. Because he found the circumstances unusual, Lindsay recommended that the execution of the will be witnessed by two subscribing <a id="p937" href="#p937" data-label="937" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*937</a>witnesses. When Lindsay was unable to find persons at the hospital to act as subscribing witnesses, he suggested that he return the following morning. This, he said, would also enable him to correct the name of one of the charitable beneficiaries named in the will. Blain did not voice any objection to this procedure. Lindsay, however, did not return until shortly after noon on the following day. When he arrived at the hospital, he found that Blain had been transferred to a Philadelphia hospital where he died later that afternoon.</p>
    <p id="b1017-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1017.4",1017,[223,860,752,324]]]'>Gregg filed a civil action against Lindsay, alleging that he, Gregg, was a third party beneficiary to an agreement between Blain and Lindsay.

Section 302(2) defines all beneficiaries who are not intentional beneficiaries as incidental beneficiaries. The standing requirement leaves discretion with the trial court to determine whether recognition of third party beneficiary status would be “appropriate.” If the two steps of the test are met, the beneficiary is an intended beneficiary “unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1018-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1018.4",1018,[198,1139,722,1605]]]'>Applying these general considerations and Restatement (Second) § 302 to the case of beneficiaries under a will, the following analysis emerges. The underlying contract is that between the testator and the attorney for the drafting of a will. The will, providing for one or more named beneficiaries, clearly manifests the intent of the testator to benefit the legatee. Under Restatement (Second) § 302(1), the recognition of the “right to performance in the beneficiary” would be “appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties” since the estate either cannot or will not bring suit. Since only named beneficiaries can bring suit, they meet the first step standing requirement of § 302. Being named beneficiaries of the will, the legatees are intended, rather than incidental, beneficiaries who would be § 302(l)(b) beneficiaries for whom “the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.” In the case of a testator-attorney contract, the attorney is the promisor, promising to draft a will which carries out the testator’s intention to benefit the legatees. The testator is the promisee, who intends that the named beneficiaries have the benefit of the attorney’s promised performance. The circumstances which clearly indicate the testator’s intent to benefit a named legatee are his arrangements with the attorney and the text of his will.</blockquote>

There, the decedent, prior to undergoing open heart surgery, had employed a lawyer to prepare testamentary documents, and an appointment had been made for signing the same. Prior to signing the will, however, the plaintiff, a beneficiary designate, called the lawyer and cancelled the appointment because the testator had suffered a massive heart attack and was in intensive care. The lawyer put the documents aside and did not immediately complete the drafting thereof. On the following day, however, he was called by the plaintiff and asked to bring the documents to the hospital. By the time the documents were completed and taken to the hospital, the client had died. In an action against the lawyer, it was alleged that he had failed to act with due diligence by failing to complete the documents after learning of the client’s hospitalization. The Supreme Court of Connecticut, being concerned about a lawyer’s undivided loyalty to the client, refused to allow recovery. The Court said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1019-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1019.7",1019,[1067,1295,720,1226]]]'>A central dimension of the attorney-client relationship is the attorney’s duty of “[e]ntire devotion to the interest of the client.” This obligation would be undermined were an attorney to be held liable to third parties if, due to the attorney’s delay, the testator did not have an opportunity to execute estate planning documents prior to death. Imposition of liability would create an incentive for an attorney to exert pressure on a client to complete and execute estate planning documents summarily. Fear of liability to potential third party beneficiaries would contravene the attorney’s primary responsibility to ensure that the proposed estate plan effectuates the client’s wishes and that the client understands the available options and the legal and practical implications of whatever course of action is ultimately chosen. These potential conflicts of interests are especially significant in the context of the final disposition of a client’s estate, where the testator’s testamentary capacity and the absence of undue influence are often central issues.</blockquote>

It was Gregg and not Blain who had called Lindsay and who had directed him regarding the preparation of a will. Lindsay’s first direct contact with Blain came later the same day when Lindsay took the will which he had prepared to Blain’s hospital room. There, according to Lindsay, Blain said the will was acceptable but appeared unconcerned and disinterested. For this reason and because of the unusual circumstances leading to the drafting of the will, Lindsay sought several subscribing witnesses. Finding none, he said, he told Blain that there was a correction to be made regarding the name of one of the charities and that he would return the following morning when the will could be executed and witnessed. Lindsay testified that Blain agreed to this. Although Lindsay’s explanation was for the jury’s consideration and may have been rejected, it is clear that the will was not executed at that time. In <em>Guy v. Liederbach, <a href="/pa/501/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="501 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1782466" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0047-01">supra,</a> </em>the Supreme Court found that the executed will had firmly evidenced the existence of the third party beneficiary contract intended to benefit the legatee. Here, however, there was no executed will which, under such an analysis, could clearly establish an intent by the testator to benefit the third person. Where one seeks to prove the existence of an oral contract for the making of a will, he assumes an exacting evidentiary burden which requires clear, direct and precise evidence of each of the elements to a valid contract. <em>Hatbob v.
