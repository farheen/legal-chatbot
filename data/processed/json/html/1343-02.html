If there are several separate pieces of circumstantial evidence, it is not necessary that each piece standing separately convince you of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, before you may find the defendant guilty, all the pieces of circumstantial evidence, when considered together, must reasonably and naturally lead to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty and must convince you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words you may find the defendant guilty based on circumstantial evidence alone, but only if the total amount and quality of that evidence convince you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>
