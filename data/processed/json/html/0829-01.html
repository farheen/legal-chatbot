    <p id="b279-18" data-blocks='[["BL_279.20",279,[105,1450,1326,195]]]'>Appellant made application for patent, claiming to have invented certain new and useful improvements in brushes, stating that the invention “ relates * * * more particularly to the means for anchoring the tufts of bristles in the bore of the brush head.” .</p>

Some toothbrushes, said to have been manufactured according to the specifications, were exhibited to the court during the hearing.</p>
    <p id="b279-22" data-blocks='[["BL_279.23",279,[109,2006,1320,84]]]'>Claim 3, which appellant presents as representative, reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b279-23" data-blocks='[["BL_279.24",279,[108,2126,1325,243]]]'>A brush comprising a bach having tuft receiving bores and formed of a resiliently yieldable material, bristle tufts engaging said bores and staple anchors for securing said tufts in the form of loops having their prongs slightly crossed, the width of said staples being greater than the normal diameter of the bore and being embedded in the outside walls thereof, thereby providing clearance for the individual bristle loops.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.7",280,[232,475,1319,149]]]'>The essential novelty is that the tufts are firmly secured by round wire staples which are inserted in, and are embedded in the side walls of, the bores in the brush back, and without penetration of the staple points through the back.</blockquote>

    <p id="b280-8" data-blocks='[["BL_280.9",280,[232,854,1321,247]]]'>The British patent shows tufts secured in the holes, or bores, by staples of the same shape as those of appellant. The exact operation of these staples upon being driven seems to depend upon the material of which the brush, back is composed. According to the specifications this material may be wood, ivory, metal, or other substances.</p>

    <p id="b280-10" data-blocks='[["BL_280.11",280,[231,1408,1322,243]]]'>Appellant filed the affidavits of persons said to be familiar with the manufacture, structure, and sale of brushes for the purpose of showing that a toothbrush in which the tufts are secured by staples is something unique and also for the purpose of showing great commercial success for his product.</p>
    <p id="b280-11" data-blocks='[["BL_280.12",280,[233,1659,1319,292]]]'>Granting both these facts to be amply proven, we nevertheless do not see how they of themselves, singly or combined, can sustain pat-entability where the principle applied in the device is, as applied, definitely disclosed in the prior art. A production may be unique without being patentable, and extensive use resulting in commercial success may flow from causes other than invention.</p>
