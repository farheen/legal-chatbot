    <p id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.7",656,[203,680,1322,92]]]'>The brief on behalf of appellant describes his system and depicts its advantages as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b656-7" data-blocks='[["BL_656.8",656,[200,798,1326,1403]]]'>Briefly, the present invention comprises a one-way telephonic communication apparatus from the sales clerk to the accounting department located in a distant part of the building. There is also a teletype transmitting instrument which records copies of the material transmitted in the accounting department, and a remote teletype receiving instrument at the desk and beside the telephone of the sales clerk. In operation the sales clerk, after having made his sale, lifts the receiver of his telephone and his line is automatically connected to a girl sitting at the teletype transmitting instrument in the accounting department. The sales clerk then dictates by the telephone to this typist before the teletype transmitter the name and address of the customer and the items sold together with the prices. As this typist is taking this dictation directly from the clerk onto the teletype transmitter, another clerk in the accounting department looks at the records and determines the credit rating of the customer. This credit rating is found before the typist has finished her teletyping, and she is informed by the clerk in the accounting department whether the credit is acceptable or not. If it is, she so indicates on her teletype transmitter. The information the typist is teletyping onto her teletype transmitter is being, transcribed in clear type on the remote teletype receiving instrument in front of the clerk, as well as on a copy in the accounting department. The effect is that the sales clerk, while dictating to the teletypist, may at the same time watch his dictation being transcribed in front of him in clear type and if any mistakes are made, he may immediately correct them in his dictation. There is no teletype transmitter at the sales clerk’s end of the system, and there is therefore no means for the sales clerk to change, mark or mar in any way the sales slip which is being transcribed in front of him and which he, in the end, tears off and hands to the customer. Inasmuch as the sales clerk writes nothing whatever on the sales slip, but merely dictates it through the accounting department, there is no possibility of the clerk writing illegibly on the sales slip or writing different names or information or prices from that which he has given to the accounting department. The record of the transaction is therefore, at all times without the control of the sales clerk and thus there is an assurance that the credit rating obtained is the credit rating of the person whose name is written on the sales slip and that the total transaction is correct.</blockquote>

    <p id="b657-11" data-blocks='[["BL_657.11",657,[83,1569,1324,243]]]'>That the Block patent discloses that the conception of communication between the sales clerk and the accounting office in a department store by electric signal and telephone is not new — the sole purpose for which it was cited by the examiner — is conceded, and that reference requires no further attention.</p>
    <p id="b657-12" data-blocks='[["BL_657.12",657,[124,1819,1283,45]]]'>Appellant’s discussion of the British patent is in part as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b657-13" data-blocks='[["BL_657.13",657,[82,1890,1326,537]],["BL_658.1",658,[213,266,1323,328]]]'>The foreign British reference 378,064 is quite complicated and the exact procedure taught is very difficult to understand. However, it relates to the supplying of an auxiliary teleprinter service over an ordinary telephone at voice frequency wherein either telephone equipment or teleprinter equipment may be connected at will to the line, each to the exclusion of the other, or as an alternative system wherein the telephone may be automatically shunted from its normal line onto a second line to permit normal use while the teleprinter is in operation. Briefly, the British patent provides a combined teletype receiver and teletype transmitter to the subscriber of the usual telephone system. It provides means whereby, a subscriber may call another subscriber on the telephone in the normal manner, -and if he discovers by signal means that the person being called is not at home, and has the necessary instrument, he may switch over, or he may be automatically switched over to the teletype machines on the same <a id="p1340" href="#p1340" data-label="1340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1340</a>voice frequency line. The result is that he may teletype a message to the absent party being called requesting a return call or transcribing information as desired. It is also possible by use of the British teachings for two parties in oral conversation to switch over to the respective teletype machines if they desire and write messages back and forth. There is a modification shown wherein the telephone may be connected to a second line while the teletype receiver is in operation and thus permit normal use of the telephone with other parties while the teletype is receiving.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[208,604,1326,238]]]'>The British reference is concerned only with the usual normal telephone system and is for use between different subscribers just in the way that the oral telephone system is now being used. The British reference does not contemplate, nor suggest, in any way that the telephone and teleprinter may be used in simultaneous operation between the same stations, nor does it show a machine or device which permits this use.</blockquote>
    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[213,866,1322,93]]]'>Commenting upon tlie last above quoted sentence the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office says :</p>

It is urged that the British patent contains nothing which could solve the problem solved by appellant’s system and that hence the board erred in holding the British patent an anticipation.</p>

The latter declares, in substance, as above quoted, that the British apparatus was particularly adaptable for use in such stores. We do not find in the British patent any reference to department store use. Indeed, no use in any particular industry or business seems to be suggested, but a system is described apparently adapted to use in many places. Modification of the apparatus for some particular uses doubtless would be required, but we are unable to agree that such modifications as are disclosed by applicant here represent anything more than mechanical skill. No novel individual feature is shown; each is old. This fact of itself would not, of course, preclude the possibility of invention in the combination, but in the instant case we fail to find any invention novelty in the combination.</p>
