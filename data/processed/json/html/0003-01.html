Dr. Malumed testified that he is a ‘panel physician’ for U.S. Air and examined Claimant on several occasions in connection with his complaints of back pain. The doctor was of the opinion that Claimant displayed some symptoms secondary to arthritis, and he approved Claimant’s return to work at both the March 18, and April 11, 1991 visits stating ‘Eugene is improving in his lower back. He still gets radiations down his left leg which is occasional in nature.’ This doctor concluded that although Claimant could return back [sic] to his pre-injury occupation, he would continue to have back pain on occasion, and would be helped by continued home therapy.

Dr. Bechman [sic] was of the opinion that Claimant still had occasional back pain with impairment referable to degenerative changes in the spine. This physician was of the opinion that Claimant may not be able to perform his pre-injury employment but did not have the benefit of a work capacity study to support his conclusion. Dr. Bachman was further of the opinion that as of the time of his examination Claimant suffered no residual impairment for his original work injury and any restrictions were a result of the degenerative arthritis. I find the opinion of this physician to be credible in part in that Claimant could not return to his pre-injury employment without continuing pain or restrictions and adopt that as of the fact of this case.</blockquote>

Dr. Ma-lumed testified that Claimant still had symptoms, secondary, to the arthritis, (WCJ Finding of Fact 3) and thus, this testimony did not “disconnect” Claimant’s present back pain from his February 1991 work-related injury. Therefore, the WCJ correctly held that this testimony did not support USAir’s burden of proving its entitlement to a termination of Claimant’s benefits. While Dr. Bachman did testify that Claimant suffered no residual impairment from his original work injury, the WCJ did not credit this testimony. (WCJ Finding of Fact 4). Therefore, we hold that USAir failed to produce substantial evidence to prove that Claimant had fully recovered from his work-related injury to be entitled to a termination of benefits.
