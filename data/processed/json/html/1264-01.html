The New English'Dictionary (Oxford) is authority for the statement that in Greek it was not used in combination except as standing for e, <em>£, a </em>(epsilon, xi, alpha) — pronounced hexa — before a vowel, “ but used as a combining element in modern formation, chiefly in chemistry (where hexa is more regular), in sense “ containing six atoms or molecules of the radical or substance; ” as <em>“ </em>hexbenzoate, hexbromide,” etc.</p>

The public has an interest which must be preserved, and it is not safe to dismiss an opposition proceeding wholly upon prior registrations, if it appear that the marks are in fact of close resemblance. It may be true that in some cases the use and registration of some words have become so common and general as that an additional registration might be thought to do no more at most than create a situation of “ confusion worse confounded,” but, upon the whole, the safer rule and the one which appear to us to be truly interpretive of the law is to reject registration when there is confusable conflict between the words at issue themselves.</p>
