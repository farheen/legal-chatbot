Based on these general rules, they argue that Jennifer is not entitled to recover her medical expenses as damages.

First, she argues that in order for this waiver to be valid, it must have been exercised when the Myers still had the right to waive. Since the Myers filed their action after the statute of limitations had run, Dr. Esterly contends there was nothing to waive. In support of her argument, Dr. Esterly cites 28 Am.Jur.2d, Estoppel and Waiver, § 157 and 92 C.J.S., <em>Waiver </em>at 1055 (“There can be no waiver of a non-existent or lost right”).</p>

Both courts acknowledged the general rule, as this Court recognized was also applicable in Delaware, that normally the parents have the right to recover these expenses. A basis, but not the only basis, for this rule is to prevent double recovery. Such double recovery is impossible here and, thus, the policy is served.</p>

As the Court said earlier, the result of that position is to eviscerate any recovery Jennifer makes (or would have made in this case). Medicaid’s right of reimbursement from damage awards includes items which Dr. Esterly concedes Jennifer can recover, such as pain and suffering and medical expenses during majority.</p>
