First, he contends that the tidal judge violated his right to self-representation when she “forced” him to reconcile his differences with his appointed lawyer after he had knowingly and intelligently waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Second, Drake contends that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on the claim-of-right defense provided by 11 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 847. We find no merit to Drake’s arguments and affirm.</p>

He hasn’t been there to see me but twice and I feel as though I’m not represented fairly by my lawyer, so I didn’t — so I asked him to remove [sic] from my case.” Drake further explained to the trial court that there was no possibility that he and defense counsel could get along. The judge then explained to Drake that if his attorney was removed from the case, he would have to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Drake understood. After determining whether Drake’s waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent and after informing Drake of the risks associated with proceeding <em>pro se, </em>the trial court concluded:</p>

However, I find that Mr. Drake is making his waiver of right to counsel knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. I’ve explained the risks to him. He appears to be an alert and intelligent man and he appears to understand those risks.</blockquote>

That has to- do with 19 different charges against you — 18, because the last one’s going to be separated. But this is complicated stuff.

I’m not going to threaten you anymore.” If you can bring yourself to do that, I can get you some help and, then, we will have a fair trial because you will have the assistance of a professional sitting right next to you, and you can tell him all these things you’re concerned about, and it’s his job to listen to what you say.</blockquote>

The former defense counsel spoke with Drake, the court reconvened and the trial judge asked if the two had reconciled their differences. Defense counsel explained, “[t]here was a cooperative conversation downstairs, yes. And I think Mr. Drake’s position is that, you know, he does want counsel.” The trial judge then asked Drake if he was “okay with this?” Drake answered affirmatively. The case was rescheduled to allow defense counsel to prepare for the trial.</p>
    <p id="b818-12" data-blocks='[["BL_818.13",818,[992,1887,752,768]]]'>The following facts were presented at trial. Scot Nordmeier lived with Deanna Parker in a room Nordmeier rented from Frank Starret. On September 14, 2006, at around 5:30 a.m., Parker returned home from visiting her mother and went into the bedroom. Starret was at the house when Parker arrived, but left shortly thereafter for work. Approximately twenty minutes later, Nordmeier and Parker heard a loud sound which appeared to be coming from the front of the home. Moments later, a black man wearing a mask and holding a shotgun burst through Nordmeier and Parker’s door and demanded money.</p>

Drake also testified that during the early morning hours on the day of the incident, he and Nordmeier were in Nordmeier’s backyard drinking and getting high. He further testified that while he was outside of the house, two unknown individuals came into the backyard, took Drake into the house and told him not to move.

Drake did not say that he intended to represent himself. He only told the judge that he wanted a “fair trial.” His reply prompted the advice from the court that having a lawyer would be more “fair” to Drake than proceeding <em>pro se </em>on an 18 count indictment against a seasoned prosecutor. We note that the trial judge asked Drake for his permission to find his former counsel so he could “help” Drake. Drake gave his express permission for his former counsel to be located for this purpose. After conferring with counsel, the former defense counsel told the trial judge that Drake wanted counsel..
