Put another way, to the extent that a decision is committed to an agency’s discretion, the reviewing court cannot replace the agency’s judgment with its own. The reviewing court, on the other hand, is frequently charged by a separate statute to ensure that an agency does not abuse its discretion by acting in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>E.g., </em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="5 U.S.C. § 706">5 U.S.C. § 706</a>(2)(A); D.C.Code § l-1510(a)(3)(A) (1981); D.C.Code § 43-906 (1981). Thus, when a statute entrusts a decision to agency discretion, there is usually a need to reconcile that statute with the reviewing court’s statutory mandate to scrutinize exercises of agency discretion. <em>See Littell v.

In contrast, once it is determined that an agency action falls within the scope of an express statutory preclusion provision, it is ordinarily not necessary for a court to evaluate the pragmatic effects of judicial review. It is generally understood that the legislature has weighed the benefits and detriments of permitting review and has made its intent clear in the plain meaning of the provision precluding review. Only with respect to a small number of narrowly-drawn exceptions, including constitutional challenges and claims of “clear departure” from an unambiguous statutory mandate, have courts been willing to deviate from the plain meaning of preclusion provisions and to read legislative intent to permit review.</p>

Unlike the “middle position” approach to agency discretion adopted by the federal APA, D CA-PA § 1-1508 does not permit this court to examine orders dismissing petitions for declaratory rulings on a case-by-case basis to determine whether meaningful review would be feasible.

If, for example, in setting forth its reasons for not issuing a requested declaratory order, an agency issues an alternative — albeit unsolicited — declaratory order, review of that alternative declaratory order is appropriate.

I express no opinion on this issue but note that the validity of the FAC must be determined by way of a direct challenge to that rate mechanism. If the FAC — in its present form, uninterpreted and unclarified by the Commission — violates some legal or constitutional standard, this must be determined by reviewing the operation of the FAC and the record developed to support its adoption, not by reviewing the Commission’s decision refusing to issue a declaratory order. <em>See People’s Counsel v.

        <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone </em>recognized that Congress chose to transfer jurisdiction in this manner because it wanted to exempt the Commission from the standard and scope of review provisions contained in DCAPA § 1-1510. <a href="/a2d/339/0710-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="339 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="8040616" data-case-paths="/a2d/339/0710-01">339 A.2d at 713</a>. Consequently, while DCAPA § 1-1510 provides this court with an affirmative authorization to review the decisions of most District agencies, the affirmative authority to review orders and decisions of the Commission—including the standard and scope of review to be used—is established solely by that agency’s organic act, D.C.Code Title 43. <em>See </em>D.C.Code §§ 43-905, -906 (1981). <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone </em>went on, however, to hold that “except in the area of appellate procedure and scope of review <em>[i.e., </em>DCAPA § 1-1510], the drafters of the [DC] APA intended the Act to apply to the Commission.” <a href="/a2d/339/0710-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="339 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="8040616" data-case-paths="/a2d/339/0710-01">339 A.2d at 712-13</a> (footnote omitted).

By requiring some change in the <em>status quo </em>before an order dismissing a declaratory order petition may be judicially reviewed, I do not subscribe to the "negative order doctrine” rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Rochester Telephone Corp. v.

That judicially-created doctrine embodied an illusory distinction between orders that resulted in "action" and those that constituted “non-action.” <em>Id. </em><a href="/us/307/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="307 U.S. 125" data-case-ids="6137459" data-case-paths="/us/307/0125-01">307 U.S. at 141</a>, <a href="/us/307/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="222" data-cite="307 U.S. 125" data-case-ids="6137459" data-case-paths="/us/307/0125-01">59 S.Ct. at 762</a>.

My reading of § 1-1508 does not turn on any such metaphysical distinction between action and inaction. An agency decision not to issue a declaratory order involves no more and no less an exercise of agency discretion than does a decision to issue such an order. Moreover, both of these decisions result in action, one by changing the <em>status quo </em>and the other by reaffirming it. An agency decision dismissing a declaratory order without altering the <em>status quo </em>is unreviewable in this jurisdiction not because it fails to rise to the level of administrative action, but rather because such an exercise of agency discretion is made unreviewable by § 1-1508.</p>

Section 1-1508 was intended to protect both the ultimate agency decision not to issue a declaratory order and the deliberative process leading to such a decision. Consequently, this court is precluded not only from reviewing a dismissal of a declaratory order petition, but also from reviewing substantive decisions made during the course of an investigation leading to such a dismissal — unless the substantive decision results in a binding change in the legal <em>status quo </em>with effects beyond the dismissal of the petition.</p>
      <p id="b1354-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1354.14",1354,[1045,1789,720,899]]]'>This same basic result has been reached on slightly different grounds by federal courts dealing with the propriety of reviewing decisions made during the course of investigations that do not result in reviewable orders. Where an order is found not to be a proper subject for judicial review (usually on some basis other than an express preclusion provision), decisions made during the course of a preceding investigation are held to lack the finality necessary to warrant judicial review. <em>See International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. v.

Although my analysis turns solely on a reading of § 1-1508, its effect on the judicial review of findings and conclusions made during the course of an investigation is very similar to that of the doctrine of administrative finality, with its emphasis on a requisite level of aggrievement.</p>

Although there is no need for this court to evaluate the policy implications of permitting judicial review here, the present case provides an excellent illustration of the policies that underlie § 1-1508’s preclusion provision. In the absence of § 1-1508’s preclusion provision, declaratory orders could be requested, and the Commission could be compelled to investigate, every change in the price PEPCO paid for fuel or received for interchange transactions. Each price change could bring a new declaratory order petition asking the Commission to determine whether the FAC should be read to permit the new price to be passed through to ratepayers. The Commission would be forced time and again to develop support for its decisions whether or not to pass a price change through the FAC. This would undermine the purpose of the FAC and unnecessarily burden the Commission and this court. While it is appropriate for the Commission to consider clarifications or modifications of the FAC in light of particular changes in the price of fuel or interchange transactions, sound policy supports § 1-1508’s preclusion of review where the agency decides not to change established policy.</p>
