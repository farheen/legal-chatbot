Defendants have made a sham out of the system of justice and thwarted imposition of their ultimate penalty with continuous petitions for relief that often present claims without a legal foundation. As one court stated, “We have created a web of procedures so involved that they threaten to engulf the penalty itself.” State v. Steffen, <a href="/citations/?q=639%20N.E.2d%2067" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="639 N.E.2d 67">639 N.E.2d 67</a>, 73 (Ohio 1994) (limiting post-conviction relief for capital cases).</p>

The logic behind such a rule is that if counsel for post-conviction proceedings, as well as trial and direct appeal, must meet the same standards, then claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the immediate prior proceeding may be raised ad infinitum.</p>
    <p id="b652-8" data-blocks='[["BL_652.7",652,[195,1359,1121,258]]]'>Finally, Bejarano also argued that the district court erred in relying on an incomplete record to deny his petition.

First, and most decisively, as discussed above, a petitioner during post-conviction proceedings has no right to effective assistance of counsel unless that court is mandated by statute to appoint counsel. <em>See McKague, </em><a href="/nev/112/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="112 Nev. 159" data-case-ids="11822868" data-case-paths="/nev/112/0159-01">112 Nev. at </a>165 n.5, <a href="/nev/112/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="112 Nev. 159" data-case-ids="11822868" data-case-paths="/nev/112/0159-01">912 P.2d at </a>258 n.5. Therefore, since the district <a id="p1471" href="#p1471" data-label="1471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1471</a>court was not <em>required </em>by NRS 177.345(1) to appoint counsel for Bejarano, it did not err in denying the claim.</p>
    <p id="b653-6" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[184,458,1125,585]]]'>Second, Bejarano had the “burden of pleading and proving <em>specific </em>facts that demonstrate: (a) Good cause for the petitioner’s failure to present the claim or for presenting the claim again; and (b) Actual prejudice to the petitioner.” NRS 34.810(3) (emphasis added). A petitioner for post-conviction relief has the burden of establishing the factual allegations in support of his petition. Lozada v. State, <a href="/nev/110/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="110 Nev. 349" data-case-ids="8557843" data-case-paths="/nev/110/0349-01">110 Nev. 349</a>, 353-54 n.3, <a href="/nev/110/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="110 Nev. 349" data-case-ids="8557843" data-case-paths="/nev/110/0349-01">871 P.2d 944</a>, 947 n.3 (1994). The failure of Bejarano’s court-appointed counsel in this post-conviction proceeding to provide the record relevant to his petition does not constitute the “good cause” required by NRS 34.810. Therefore, contrary to Bejarano’s contention, this failure does not preclude the district court from dismissing his petition.</p>

I will not be engaging in a polemic on the constitutional niceties relating to the rights of <a id="p1472" href="#p1472" data-label="1472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1472</a>accuseds to be represented by counsel; instead, I base my case for providing <em>effective </em>counsel to impoverished criminal defendants on our own statutory scheme. Simply stated, our statutes allow for the appointment of counsel in post-conviction proceedings; and to me, appointment of counsel means appointment of effective counsel and not ineffective counsel.</p>

If the defendant is indigent, the court is empowered to appoint counsel. NRS 34.750(1) (“[T]he court may appoint counsel to represent the petitioner.”). Once counsel <em>undertakes </em>the representation of such a defendant, I cannot believe that the misdeeds or faulty representation of that counsel should be able to escape the judicial review of this court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

    <p id="b654-6" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[226,883,1124,527]]]'>My views are based on the assumption that all judicial irregularities must be subject to some kind of review by instituted appellate authority. Thus, for example, if a defendant were to come to us claiming that his attorney had missed the filing deadline in an appeal or had been drunk during the post-conviction proceedings, I do not think that it would be wise or just to turn our backs on such a claimant. If, as the majority rules, an indigent defendant has <em>no </em>right to effective counsel and no right to judicial review of “counsel’s performance in post-conviction proceedings,” then even the kinds of gross attorney malpractice mentioned above would escape judicial review. This does not seem fair to me.</p>
    <p id="b654-7" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[228,1424,1123,447]]]'>I do not feel called upon to discuss the scope of review that would be necessary in post-conviction cases because the majority has turned down any and all claims to the right of review by indigent defendants on the issue of effectiveness of counsel in post-conviction proceedings. It is my view that judicial review of some kind is mandated once counsel has been appointed by the district court. It does not seem reasonable to me that an attorney can be appointed and then not be subject to any surveillance or subsequent review of ineffective and prejudicial performance on the attorney’s part.</p>
    <p id="b654-8" data-blocks='[["BL_654.7",654,[226,1879,1120,129]],["BL_655.1",655,[184,299,1122,351]]]'>I am aware of the contention of some that a holding which gives to an indigent defendant the right to review of counsel’s performance in post-conviction proceedings might possibly lead <a id="p1473" href="#p1473" data-label="1473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1473</a>to a reluctance on the part of district judges to appoint counsel at all in these kinds of proceedings. I believe, however, that in any case in which an indigent defendant presented to the court reasonable grounds for post-conviction relief, it would be very probable that the judge in such a case would appoint counsel. Ordinarily such counsel would perform effectively, but when this was not the case, such a situation should be subject to review by the appellate court.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[182,665,1124,451]]]'>There are those who say that permitting review of the performance of counsel in post-conviction matters would result in a facing-mirrors effect, wherein proof of ineffectiveness of counsel would only result in the appointment of other counsel whose performance would then, in turn, be subject to further review, <em>ad infinitum. </em>This conjecture does not appear to me to present as great a menace to the fair administration of criminal justice as permitting a very bad and prejudicial performance by counsel in post-conviction proceedings to pass without any remedy by way of judicial review.</p>
    <p id="b655-6" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[181,1123,1122,402]]]'>In Grondin v.

I disagree with this change in course and with this court’s overruling of <em>Grondin.</em>
