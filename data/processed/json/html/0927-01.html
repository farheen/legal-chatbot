Appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by concluding, as a matter of law, that the ambulance was on an emergency run and thus submitting to the jury only the issue whether or not the District of Columbia in its operation of the ambulance was grossly negligent.</p>

D.C.Code § 1-1211(4) defines “emergency run” as “the movement of a District-owned vehicle, by direction of the operator or of some other authorized person or agency, under circumstances which lead the operator or such persons or agency to believe that such vehicle should proceed expeditiously upon a particular mission or to a designated location for the purpose of dealing with a supposed fire or other emergency, an alleged violation of a statute or regulation, or other incident requiring emergency action, or the prompt transportation to a place of treatment or greater safety of an alleged sick or injured person.”</p>

The testimony of the <a id="p929" href="#p929" data-label="929" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*929</a>paramedics<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was that they were transporting a woman who had called 911 after falling and suffering a head wound. Although the paramedics had given the woman’s injuries a low rating of seriousness, they transported her as an emergency run (with siren and flashing lights) because it was Fire Department policy and procedure to so treat all transports of injured persons resulting from 911 calls.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At the conclusion of the testimony, the court instructed the jury that, as a matter of law, the ambulance in this case was on an emergency run, and that they were to decide whether the District of Columbia was grossly negligent in its operation of the ambulance.</p>
    <p id="b963-4" data-blocks='[["BL_963.4",963,[144,1089,754,725]]]'>Appellant contends that § 1-1211(4), in its use of the words “under circumstances which lead the operator or such persons or agency to believe that such vehicle should proceed expeditiously,” requires the evaluation of the circumstances to be made on an individual, case-by-case basis. She further contends that the Fire Department’s internal policy, which treats all patient transports resulting from 911 calls as an emergency run, conflicts with this requirement. Instead, she argues, the determination whether the ambulance was on an emergency run should be made by the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The trial court correctly concluded that the determination whether the Department’s policy satisfies this statutory provision, or whether an individualized determination must be made, is a question of law, and thus is not appropriate for jury determination. <em>See, e.g., Doe by Fein v. District of Columbia, </em><a href="/a2d/697/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="697 A.2d 23" data-case-ids="12009286" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/0023-01">697 A.2d 23</a>, 27-29 (D.C.1997) (determination whether police report satisfies statutory notice requirement of D.C.Code § 12-309 is question of law for court).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We do not see a conflict between the Fire Department’s policy and § 1-1211(4) since the statute, which expressly provides for the decision to be made by “the operator or ... persons or agency,” does not rule out the adoption of a policy such as the one at issue here. Furthermore, the policy does not appear unreasonable on its face.</p>
