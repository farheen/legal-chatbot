    <p id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[67,465,1331,649]]]'>As to this we may say that, so far as we can determine, appellant’s motion to dissolve was quite comprehensive and specific in stating the reasons upon which it was based, and it is certain that the dis-mission contained in his petition to the board for rehearing covered in detail, although in somewhat different phraseology, the various technical matters presented to us (with the exception of the oper-ability of Robinson’s process), the limitations relied on being italicized and argued at length. We feel quite confident that the board as well as the Primary Examiner (the Examiner of Interferences not having had occasion to consider the case on the merits) fully understood the issues and the position of appellant respecting them, and that such issues were considered by those tribunals in the light of their expert knowledge of the subject matter.</p>
    <p id="b711-6" data-blocks='[["BL_711.6",711,[65,1121,1331,93]]]'>The Primary Examiner described the invention and the disclosures ■of the respective parties broadly as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b711-7" data-blocks='[["BL_711.7",711,[65,1242,1332,700]]]'>The invention relates to a process of decolorizing viscous lubricating oil ■with clay, and more particularly the oil is first mixed with a normally gaseous hydrocarbon solvent at an elevated temperature under pressure sufficient to maintain said solvent in the liquid state. The disclosure of Tears relates to the use of propane as the preferred diluent or solvent, but other liquefiable gases may be used. The diluent in Tears at a temperature corresponding to a solvent vapor pressure in excess of 150 pounds per square inch is mixed with the oil and then the mixture is heated to cause complete solution and ■extreme dilution. The heated solution may be passed directly to the clay ■chamber or it may be first cooled to a temperature corresponding to a solvent vapor pressure of 150 pounds per square inch. The Tears disclosure also relates to the reactivation of clay by interrupting the passage of the oil •solution through it while fresh liquefied normally gaseous hydrocarbon maintained in liquid form is passed through said clay. According to- data submitted and made of record in the Tears patented file the temperature of liquefied propane corresponding to its vapors pressure of 150 pounds per square inch is about 85 degrees Fahrenheit.</blockquote>

Robinson describes the treatment of a lubricating oil stock by first mixing it with propane at a pressure of about 50 to 200 pounds, depending upon the vapor pressure of the propane. The mixture is acid treated in a mixer wherein the temperature is preferably about 75 to 90° Fahrenheit which could be regulated by the use of heating or cooling coils. The mixture of acid, oil and propane is then passed into a reaction tank and kept there for a sufficient time to allow for complete reaction, then the sour oil is separate from the sludge. The acid treated oil is then passed to clay contacting or percolating filters. Robinson describes the maintenance of temperatures of the order of 70 to 90° F. within the reaction tank by withdrawing vapors of propane from <a id="p1394" href="#p1394" data-label="1394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1394</a>the top thereof. Robinson also discloses the reactivation of the clay beds by washing out the filters at intervals with propane and then treating with caustic alkali and a solvent mixture.</blockquote>

We find no specific reference to a chart in the decision of the board. The record also contains a document described in the brief on behalf of Tears as “a magnified portion of this chart showing the vapor pressure curves of propane, butane and pentane.” This appears in the record on page 126A. It is referred to in appellant’s petition for rehearing as having been “used by Tears at the hearing.” We assume that it was meant by this that it was used at the hearing before the Primary Examiner but whether the Primary Examiner’s reference to “the chart made of record in the file of Tears patent 2,061,802” was to this so-called “magnified portion,” or to the chart itself, is not clear. The “magnified portion” is more than that term indicates in that it contains printed matter, not embraced in the chart itself, referring specifically to the patent and application here at issue. The accuracy of this “magnified portion” is challenged in the brief for liobinson at least to the extent that in a supplement thereto an-<a id="p1395" href="#p1395" data-label="1395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1395</a>oilier chart is presented which is described as “a corrected copy of page 126A of the record.”</p>
    <p id="b713-3" data-blocks='[["BL_713.4",713,[85,357,1334,649]]]'>The brief on behalf of Tears contains the statement, in substance, that in technical literature two different pressures are used; namely, “gauge pressure” and “absolute pressure”; that when pressure is stated in pounds per square inch it is “universally understood” that the unit is gauge pressure; that when absolute pressure is meant it is “always stated as ‘Pressure in lbs. per sq. in absolute’ or ‘Absolute pres, lbs. Per Square Inch’ as it appears on the chart”; that gauge pressure is converted to absolute pressure by adding approximately 15 pounds ‘per -square inch-; that-a gauge pressure-of-ISO pounds per square inch would approximate an absolute pressure of 165 pounds per square inch, and that to convert absolute pressure to gauge pressure the process is reversed and approximately 15 pounds is deducted from the absolute pressure.</p>
    <p id="b713-4" data-blocks='[["BL_713.5",713,[89,1013,1332,445]]]'>The counts at issue require that the mixture of oil and the liquefied normally gaseous hydrocarbon solvent (count 2 being limited to propane as the solvent) be heated to a temperature in excess of 150-pounds per square inch, and it is the contention of Tears that this; should be interpreted as meaning <em>gauge </em>pressure. Based upon this construction he,directs attention to, lines and curves shown upon the-“magnified portion” of the chart which are claimed to demonstrate that Robinson does not disclose a pressure <em>in excess </em>of 150 pounds per square inch, as the counts require.</p>
    <p id="b713-5" data-blocks='[["BL_713.6",713,[87,1466,1333,396]]]'>The party Robinson responds that the counts do not call for gauge pressure; that nowhere in his patent does Tears refer to gauge pressure ; that vapor pressures of solvents are not ordinarily referred to as: gauge pressures; that the vapor pressure curves supplied to the Patent Office in the Tears file do not refer to gauge pressure; that there is no foundation whatever for reading the word- “gauge” into the-counts, and, in the chart supplied by Robinson for use in the argument, emphasis appears to be placed upon absolute pressure.</p>

This was suggested during the oral argument before us and counsel for the parties were invited to furnish any authorities deemed to be in point. We have been supplied with definitions of pressure quoted from what are stated to be standard and well recognized authorities. Assuming, without deciding, that we might properly look to them, they have been examined but they are found to be conflicting and not clear in some material respects, and we do not feel justified in accepting them as establishing appellant’s contentions.

Appellant insists this means <em>pure </em>propane, thus arguing for the insertion of another limitation (pure) into the counts, or at least into count 2. It is pointed out that the <a id="p1397" href="#p1397" data-label="1397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1397</a>specification of Robinson defines the propane proposed to be used by him “to mean commercial propane or mixtures of propane with butane, having a vapor pressure at 100° F. of about 50-200 pounds,” and appellant insists that a gauge pressure in excess of 150 pounds per square inch will not result from the use of such a mixture, while stating that the use of pure propane will produce such result.</p>
