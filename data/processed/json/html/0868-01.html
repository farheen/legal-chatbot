Cote, chose to enter a plea of guilty to the charge. The arraignment and acceptance of the plea took place on January 23, 1969. Incarcerated at the Maine State Prison under sentence to a term of not less than U/2 years and not more than 3 years, Cote filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 14 M.R.S.A., §§ 5502-5508. He was then represented by court-appointed counsel other than the attorney who represented him at the trial level. He now makes the commonplace accusations that his plea was not made voluntarily and understandingly. He attributes his judicial confession to inadequate advocacy of incompetent counsel.</p>

Our Court in <em>Child </em>interpreted for the first time our own Rule 11 <em>"in the light of McCarthy” </em>but confined its interpretation to clause (a) of our Rule which requires that the trial court, prior to accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, make such inquiry as may satisfy it that the defendant in fact committed the crime charged. Nowhere did our Court in <em>Child </em>indicate that it considered itself bound by the <em>McCarthy </em>policy concept. Our Court apparently viewed the <em>McCarthy </em>pronouncement respecting the interpretation of Federal Rule 11 as sufficient notice to the Bench and Bar of Maine that, when a plea of guilty was received and accepted by the court, there was need to provide an adequate record affirmatively showing the plea to be factually supported, a purpose which our Rule 11 was designed to accomplish, but it omitted a full analysis of the Rule and did not touch upon the consequences which might follow noncompliance. As we read the <em>Child </em>decision, it seems only to say that, assuming noncompliance with our Rule 11, this in itself will not vitiate guilty pleas tendered before the <em>McCarthy </em>ruling. That may explain the reason why the Court declined relief to Child, but it was improvident for this Court to anchor to a federal decision the cut-off date from which the legality of guilty pleas in our own State Courts would be tested for compliance with our Rule 11. We now rule that the procedural requirements of our Rule 11, so far as the accuracy of the plea clause is concerned, shall not be held applicable to guilty pleas tendered prior to May 26, 1969, the date of the <em>Child </em>decision.</p>

However, when a trial court fails to comply with the dictates of our Rule 11 by omitting at the plea-taking proceeding an on-the-record inquiry of such a nature as would satisfy it that the defendant in fact committed the crime charged and an on-the-record determination by addressing the defendant personally that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge, this non-observance of the Rule deprives an accused of procedural safeguards designed to establish at the very time of tendering the plea its accuracy and volun-tariness. We must presume that some prejudice inherently ensues from the court’s failure to carry out the demands of Rule 11, since noncompliance with the Rule means a later fact-finding hearing in post conviction habeas corpus proceeding where greater uncertainty is bound to exist due to problems of credibility of witnesses and reliability of memories. When the habeas petitioner has made such a showing, it is only fitting that the State carry the affirmative burden of proof on the question of the voluntariness of the guilty plea. See, Rimanich v.

The finding of the Justice below with respect to the voluntariness of the plea is fully supported by credible evidence and is not clearly erroneous. His decision cannot be disturbed on appeal. Raymond v. State, Me.1969, <a href="/a2d/251/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="251 A.2d 509" data-case-ids="8076424" data-case-paths="/a2d/251/0509-01">251 A.2d 509</a>. The voluntariness of petitioner’s plea is clearly shown by the record of the post conviction hearing and satisfies any constitutional requirements of due process. <em>Grass, </em><a href="/a2d/263/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="263 A.2d 63" data-case-ids="8074643" data-case-paths="/a2d/263/0063-01">supra.</a></p>

Rastrom, Me.1970, <a href="/a2d/261/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="261 A.2d 245" data-case-ids="8079090" data-case-paths="/a2d/261/0245-01">261 A.2d 245</a>, our Court recognized that, when an issue is raised of ineffective representation of counsel by reason of the brevity of trial preparation time, an appellate court must satisfy itself not only whether any abuse of discretion has been shown in the denial of a motion for continuance, but whether the defendant has been deprived of his constitutional right to effective representation by counsel. In <em>Rastrom, </em>we concluded as did the First Circuit not to adopt the rule of presumption of the Fourth Circuit to the effect that a mere showing of brevity of time for trial preparation raises a presumption of prejudice. See, Rastrom v. Robbins, 1 Cir. 1971, <a href="/f2d/440/1251-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="440 F.2d 1251" data-case-ids="760411" data-case-paths="/f2d/440/1251-01">440 F.2d 1251</a>.

His original counsel conferred with him, so Cote testified, on two occasions, at the probable cause hearing and a second time in the county jail about two weeks before petitioner tendered his plea of guilty to the charge of escape. Cote further stated that on the advice of his first court-appointed counsel he had made up his mind to plead guilty and forego a trial. He admitted discussing his case both with his first and second court-appointed attorneys. He indicated to the Court his agreement that another attorney be appointed to represent him when his first court-appointed counsel was not available. Both attorneys were experienced in the practice of criminal law and had participated in similar cases previously. No existing meritorious defense to the charge of escape is advanced in this appeal by petitioner or his third court-appointed attorney. In the instant case, the petitioner did not want trial; he accepted the first opportunity offered to him to tender his plea of guilty to the charge so as to hasten the judicial disposition of the matter and eliminate the service of dead-time pending court hearing. At no time did Cote or his trial counsel ask for a continuance. This fact alone distinguishes it from the exceptional circumstances presented in <em>Rastrom.</em>
