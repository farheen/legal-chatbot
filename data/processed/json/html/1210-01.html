A notice of compensation payable was filed, and Claimant received benefits until they were terminated by agreement. However, when Claimant’s disability recurred, by a notice of compensation payable, Claimant again began receiving benefits for his original July 30, 1987 injury.</p>

Additionally, if termination was not granted, Employer sought a modification of the benefits because Claimant refused suitable employment. Accepting Claimant’s medical testimony over that of Employer, the Referee refused to terminate benefits. However, the Referee did agree with Employer that Claimant had refused alternative employment and modified his weekly wage. Claimant appealed to the Board which affirmed. This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Ms. Gallen testified that, at the Employer’s request, she performed a vocational evaluation of Claimant on November 29, 1989. After interviewing Claimant regarding his vocational background and interests, his educational background, his perception of his physical abilities, and his daily activities, and after reviewing Claimant’s medical records, she provided Claimant with a list of jobs that were available and which he could perform.</p>

Ms. Gallen testified that five of the employers told her that Claimant had not applied for the positions, while four of the employers stated that Claimant did apply for positions with them. Ms. Gallen also testified that she was told by Bayard Sales Corporation (Bayard) that Claimant had applied for a position there which was offered at a wage between $6.50 and $7.50 per hour plus benefits, but that he was not considered for the job because he had demanded a wage of $10.00. Ms. Gallen further testified that Bayard had told her that the position was still available to Claimant if he would consider the offered wages.</p>
