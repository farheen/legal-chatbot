Briefly, Appellant, C. Larry McKinley (“McKinley”), was stopped in his vehicle by a corporal of the Harrisburg International Airport (“HIA”) Police at a location outside the airport officer’s jurisdiction. When asked to submit to chemical alcohol testing, McKinley refused, resulting in an automatic, administrative suspension by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (the “Department” or “PennDOT”), of his driver’s license pursuant to the Implied Consent Law, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(a), (b) (“If any person placed under arrest for [driving under the influence (“DUI”)] is requested to submit to chemical testing and refuses to do so, ... the department shall suspend the operating privilege of the person for a period of 12 months.”). In McKinley’s statutory appeal, the common pleas court overturned the suspension on the ground that the HIA police corporal lacked extraterritorial arrest powers, but the <em>en banc </em>Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that HIA police officers possessed extra-jurisdictional powers of municipal police. <em>See McKinley v. PennDOT, </em><a href="/a2d/739/1134-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="739 A.2d 1134" data-case-ids="11568928" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/1134-01">739 A.2d 1134</a> (Pa. <a id="p702" href="#p702" data-label="702" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*702</a>Cmwlth.1999) <em>(“McKinley I”). </em>On allowance of appeal by this Court, however, we determined that the lawful exercise of police powers by HIA officers was, by legislative design, confined to airport premises; thus, we remanded for consideration of other issues relevant to the appeal. <em>See McKinley II, </em><a href="/pa/564/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="564 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1276816" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0565-01">564 Pa. at 579-85</a>, <a href="/a2d/769/1153-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="769 A.2d 1153" data-case-ids="11114290,1276816" data-case-paths="/a2d/769/1153-01,/pa/564/0565-01">769 A.2d at 1161-64</a>.

Significantly, the line of authority advocating the “police officer in fact” interpretation, exemplified by the <em>McKinley III; Kuzneski, </em>and <em>Evans </em>decisions, can be traced to <em>Miles v.

There, in reaching the conclusion that an arrest need only be an “arrest in fact” to serve as the predicate for a refusal-based suspension under the Implied Consent Law, the court emphasized that the Legislature had neither defined the term “arrest” nor required its lawfulness, as for example, it had in other legislation. <em>See id. </em>at 550, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20704" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="304 A.2d 704">304 A.2d at 708</a>.

It therefore does not necessarily follow, as the <em>McKinley III </em>majority asserts, as a corollary of the “arrest in fact” doctrine, that the General Assembly contemplated application of a “police officer in fact” doctrine in the Implied Consent Law.</p>

As Section 6308(b) permits a “police officer” to stop a vehicle where he has articulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a Vehicle Code violation, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 6308(b), equating the term “police officer” with an official who has a power of arrest only within restricted boundaries, but not necessarily at the location of any particular police-citizen encounter, would confer on limited jurisdiction officers statewide authority to stop automobiles and detain drivers for Vehicle Code violations.

Although the General Assembly did not explicitly grant extra-territorial arrest powers to HIA officers, neither did they limit such officer’s power to pursue a suspect off airport property.

    <p id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.4",737,[116,689,754,1391]]]'>In <em>McKinley II, </em>this Court held the stop effectuated by the HIA corporal was illegal because the General Assembly has not explicitly granted HIA officers extra-territorial powers. Under the rules of statutory interpretation, the HIA officer enabling statute is to be given a liberal interpretation in order to effect its object and promote justice. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928. The object of having police officers with limited jurisdiction, such as the HIA police, is to have qualified persons on the premises in case a crime occurs. In order to promote justice, such officers may from time to time have to leave the premises to effectuate a traffic or other type of investigatory stop. This is not to say these officers may patrol areas outside their jurisdiction. On the contrary, such officers should be entitled to perform their law enforcement duties outside their jurisdiction only when they are in fresh pursuit. Thus, a fair reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that when an officer witnesses a violation of law within his jurisdiction, he is allowed to pursue the suspect until he is in a position to apprehend.</p>

It also ignores the urgency involved in dangerous situations, such as a person driving under the influence.</p>
