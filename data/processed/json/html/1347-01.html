    <p id="b1414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1414.4",1414,[199,480,753,601]]]'>The relevant facts, as found by the referee, are as follows. Claimant injured her back on September 26, 1989, in the scope of her employment at the Adams Mark Hotel (Employer). Employer issued a Notice of Compensation Payable and paid disability benefits to Claimant. On December 29, 1989, Claimant signed a final receipt indicating that she was able to return to work on October 16, 1989. On January 16, 1990, Claimant filed a Petition to Set Aside Final Receipt, claiming that she still had been disabled when she signed it.</p>
    <p id="b1414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1414.5",1414,[193,1103,757,644]]]'>At the hearing before the referee, Claimant testified that on December 29, 1989, a representative of the insurance company, William Ganley, came to her house and asked her to sign a form, which, in fact, was a final receipt. She testified that she told him she did not want to sign it because she was still sick and that he told her that she needed to sign the receipt in order to receive her last benefit check. Claimant signed the form. She also testified that she does not read English well, and that she did not understand the form until a friend explained it to her.</p>

As of March 16, 1990, although she was receiving physical therapy for her back, she still experienced pain. She stated that she could not return to her pre-injury job, because she could not do the bending, lifting and pushing that her position required.</p>

They spoke at length; Claimant read the final receipt, and did not tell him that she was still sick.

He rejected the portion of her testimony, however, where she said she had told Ganley that she was still sick and that he told her she had to sign the receipt in order to receive the final check.

Baldino, more persuasive. He testified, among other things, that, after examining Claimant and reviewing her history, she had not recovered from her work-related injury when she signed the final receipt on December 29, 1989, but that as of May 4, 1990, when she was released from his care, Claimant could perform a light-duty job for one month and thereafter resume her full duty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Therefore, the referee granted Claimant’s Petition to Set Aside Final Receipt. The referee also made a finding that in his opinion, Claimant, by her own medical evidence, established that she was no longer disabled as of June 4, 1990. The referee’s finding is as follows:</p>
