In Section 712.1.D(2), the Ordinance defines an off-premises sign as “a sign which directs attention to an activity not conducted on the same premises.” An advertising sign is defined as “[a]n off-premises sign which advertises or otherwise directs attention to a commodity, business, industry, home occupation or other similar activity which is sold, offered or conducted elsewhere than on the lot upon which such sign is located.” Section 712.1.D(3). As we noted previously, with certain exceptions, off-premises signs are generally prohibited by the Ordinance in any district. As the trial court properly concluded, “Taken as a whole, provisions of Section 712 of the Ordinance only permit off-premises signs in the form of street signs, signs for churches and service clubs, political signs or temporary signs for special events. Consequently, off-premises advertising signs are completely excluded.” (Trial Court Opinion at 4-5.) Our examination of the Ordinance leads us to the same conclusion as the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b653-7" data-blocks='[["BL_653.7",653,[898,425,758,821]]]'>Baker asserts that there is no <em>de jure </em>exclusion of off-premises advertising signs because off-premises advertising signs exist <em>de facto </em>within the Township. However, even if any signs exist in violation of the Ordinance, a <em>de jure </em>exclusion exists where the ordinance on its face totally excludes a proposed use. <em>See Centre Lime and Stone Company v.

He states that off-premises advertising signs, as proposed by Clear Channel, are not for the benefit of the residents of the Township. Rather, he contends, the drivers on the Turnpike are the relevant “community.” Consequently, Baker argues that the trial court should have examined the Turnpike from the Willow Grove exit to the Delaware River Bridge to determine whether off-premises advertising signs are excluded.</p>

The properties are located along a horizontal curve and Mr. Comitta stated that a curved road requires more attention while driving than a straight one. Additionally, proposed signs located near where the Turnpike runs under the Second Street Pike Bridge would create a “portal effect” and, thus, generate another safety hazard for properties B and C.

He also opined that the proposed locations of the signs did not present any traffic safety issue with regard to the “portal effect” as described by Mr. Comitta, with the exception of the proposed sign located on Property B (which is not the subject of this appeal) because it was so close to where the Turnpike runs under the Second Street Pike Bridge. Additionally, Mr. Caruolo noted that the proposed signs do not present any safety hazard because they are to be located over 600 feet from the bridges and overpasses and at least 70 feet from the edge of the Turnpike. The Board chose to rely on the expert testimony of Mr. Caruolo in reaching its decision, rather than the testimony of Baker’s witness, Mr. Comitta. In so doing, it did not commit error, but merely assessed credibility. Having determined that. Baker did not meet his burden to prove that the removal of the total prohibition on off-premises signs would be a detriment to the public’s health, safety, morals, or general welfare, the Board acted correctly in striking the provision that established the <em>de jure </em>exclusion providing for such a total prohibition.</p>
