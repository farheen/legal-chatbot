Before reporting the case, the Committee offered Judge Dunleavy a hearing but indicated that it did not consider a hearing necessary because the material facts were undisputed. The Committee explained that it was not within its authority to determine whether section 312 overrode the Code, and if it did, whether that constituted an unconstitutional invasion by the Legislature of the Judicial Branch’s inherent power to discipline its members. The Committee later clarified that it considered Judge Dunleavy’s solicitation of five-dollar Clean Elections qualifying contributions to be “funds” within the meaning of Canon 5(A)(1)(e) because that money ultimately enabled the public funding of his entire campaign. Judge Dunleavy waived his right to a hearing before the Committee.</p>

However, Judge Dunleavy chose to proceed with his candidacy despite the September 10, 2002, Judicial Ethics Committee’s advisory opinion indicating that, unless he resigned from the bench, his candidacy would result in a violation of the Code. The Commission’s opinion, however, provided no guidance as to the constitutionality of section 312. Although Judge Dunleavy could have sought resolution of this issue in an action for declaratory judgment pursuant to M.R. Civ.

Section 312 is not essential to advancing the legislative interest of assuring that every Maine citizen, including a judge of probate, who wishes to actively participate in the political process is able to do so. Section 312 aside, a judge of probate may unilaterally free her or himself from Canon 5(A)(3)’s barrier to political participation by resigning from office or by not seeking reelection. <em>See Signorelli, <a href="/f2d/637/0853-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="637 F.2d 853" data-case-ids="1353842" data-case-paths="/f2d/637/0853-01">637 </a></em><a href="/f2d/637/0853-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="637 F.2d 853" data-case-ids="1353842" data-case-paths="/f2d/637/0853-01">F.2d at 858</a> (“New York’s scheme ... confronts the prospective candidate with a choice: he may run for Congress if he is willing to resign his judgeship.”).
