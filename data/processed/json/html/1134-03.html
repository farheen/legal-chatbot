In the <em>Wynn </em>case, the plaintiff waited for sixteen months after being awarded compensation benefits before filing an amended complaint against PEPCO. The appellate court affirmed the denial of a motion to dismiss.

Thus, facing additional liability if such right of action was successfully asserted, it had no reason to bring suit.

There are numerous operations covered by the Long-shore Act, <em>e.g., </em>dry-dock overhaul of vessels, off-shore oil rigs, shipbuilding, etc., which require the services of literally scores of subcontractors. Obviously the unions representing workers on such projects — and credited in the reports of the House and Senate Committees as helping to shape the new legislation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> — would scarcely regard favorably any legal doctrine having ominous overtones with respect to successful litigation against general contractors in maritime industries.</p>

He argues that because the 1984 act specifically makes certain provisions inapplicable or limited with regard to the Black Lung Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Act — statutes also incorporating by reference portions of the Longshore Act — the absence of any similar reference to the 1928 District of Columbia Act indicates that Congress intended that its amendments were also applicable to the latter. The short answer to this contention is that there was no occasion for Congress to exclude expressly from the application of provisions of the new law any statute already repealed. Congress was certainly aware of the repeal of the 1928 act, for the Council legislation accomplishing such action had been submitted to Congressional review for the statutory period of 30 legislative days, and became law without the disapproval of either branch.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a>
