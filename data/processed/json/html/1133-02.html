Brown appeals the denial of his second motion, attacking convictions of several criminal offenses, filed pursuant to D.C.Code § 23-110 (“second motion”), contending that the trial court should have conducted a hearing on the motion and counsel should have been appointed to represent him. The motion was denied on the ground that the issues raised had already been considered and resolved against appellant in prior proceedings, namely a previously filed § 23-110 motion (“first motion”), and the direct appeal from his convictions. Because there was a defect in the trial court’s consideration of the first motion, we hold that the trial court should have appointed counsel and conducted a hearing to resolve the second motion. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>

A timely notice of appeal was filed and new counsel<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was appointed by this court to represent Brown in the direct appeal. Thereafter Brown filed, <em>pro se, </em>the first motion<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in the trial court contending that tidal counsel’s representation was constitutionally defective because counsel failed to raise certain points relating to Brown’s mental condition. The grounds relied on in the first motion were basically the same as those later presented in the second motion, which is the subject of this appeal. The trial court transmitted a copy of Brown’s first motion to both appellate counsel and the prosecutor on <a id="p1135" href="#p1135" data-label="1135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1135</a>June 29, 1992. The trial court then scheduled a hearing on the motion for December 7, 1992, but the record is silent whether the trial court notified appellate counsel of the hearing date or requested counsel’s participation. Brown, his trial counsel, and a prosecutor appeared at the hearing; however, appellate counsel did not appear and Brown was not otherwise represented by counsel.</p>
    <p id="b1181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1181.5",1181,[204,693,753,900]]]'>During the hearing, the court received testimony from trial counsel and thereafter denied Brown’s motion in a written order entered that same day. No appeal was taken from that order. Subsequently, the direct appeal was decided adversely to Brown in a Memorandum Opinion and Judgment entered on February 26, 1993. Brown’s <em>pro se </em>petition for rehearing en banc was denied on June 8, 1993. The second motion, seeking essentially the same relief as that sought in the first motion and requesting the appointment of counsel, was filed on July 2, 1993. That motion was denied in a written order on July 12,1993, on the ground that the issues had previously been raised in the trial and appellate courts and decided adversely to Brown. This appeal, challenging the denial of that motion, followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

For example, it is well settled that ineffective assistance of trial counsel challenges, such as this one, generally must be raised during the pendency of the direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., Shepard v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/533/1278-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="533 A.2d 1278" data-case-ids="7887031" data-case-paths="/a2d/533/1278-01">533 A.2d 1278</a>, 1280 (D.C.1987). It is also well settled that the trial court is “not required to entertain a second or successive [§ 23-110] motion[s] for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.” <em>Vaughn v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/600/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="600 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="7348558" data-case-paths="/a2d/600/0096-01">600 A.2d 96</a>, 97 (D.C.1991) (citation omitted); D.C.Code § 23-110(e) (1992). Thus, because the second motion in this case raised issues essentially identical to those unsuccessfully raised in previous proceedings, under most circumstances, the trial court would be free to deny the motion without conducting a hearing or appointing counsel, as the trial court did here.</p>

Appellate counsel did not appear, and no other attorney was present on Brown’s behalf. Thus, having been granted a hearing on his <em>pro se </em>motion, Brown was without counsel to act on his behalf even though he was entitled to have counsel appointed. We must now determine what consequences, if any, flow from the trial court’s failure to appoint counsel to assist Brown in pursuing his claims against trial counsel in the first motion.</p>

Olevsky challenged his convictions for several minor misdemeanor offenses, which did not result in incarceration, on the ground that he was improperly denied the opportunity to request representation by counsel. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 11-2602. We observed that the trial judge ignored his “obligation to recognize that he had a discretionary right to appoint counsel for Olevsky and to exercise that discretion in an informed and meaningful manner,” and held that where an indigent defendant was deprived of his right to have counsel appointed, absent a valid waiver, his conviction must be reversed. <em><a href="/a2d/548/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="548 A.2d 78" data-case-ids="7871985" data-case-paths="/a2d/548/0078-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/548/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="548 A.2d 78" data-case-ids="7871985" data-case-paths="/a2d/548/0078-01">at 83</a> (citation omitted).</p>

There is nothing in the record, however, showing that Brown was either informed of his right to counsel or that he waived that right. The result was that Brown was denied his statutory right to be represented by counsel during the hearing on the first motion.

In our view, Brown's failure to request counsel is not fatal to his cause because D.C.Code § 11-2602 (1992) requires the trial court to advise Brown of his right to counsel in such circumstances, and no such advice was given. In short, since Brown was never informed he had a right to counsel, his failure to expressly request representation does not bar him from the benefits conferred in <em>Doe, i.e., </em>the right to appointment of counsel in circumstances where a hearing is required.</p>
