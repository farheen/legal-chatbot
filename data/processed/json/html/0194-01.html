The action arose out of the purchase of residential property by the Bartners. Ap-pellees Carter and Moore, relying on information furnished by the seller, advertised the property in the following language:</p>

Appellant Jay Bartner testified that the premises were offered for sale at $32,000, that the Bartners made a counter-offer of $28,000, and that the price agreed on was $30,000. A real estate agent called as a witness by the appellants testified that the premises were worth $30,000 at the time of sale.</p>

On October 1, appellants wrote to Moore stating that on an examination of the deed to the property they had noticed a reference to the area of the lot as being one-half acre, that the discrepancy caused them some concern, and that they “would <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>like to settle it before the closing on October 5th.” They suggested that the diminution in acreage represented a diminution in market value amounting to $1,500. In a telephone conversation with appellants, Moore acknowledged that there had been a mistake and that the lot was somewhere between one-half and three-fourths of an acre. Appellants’ demand for a reduction of the price was refused, but the seller himself, in a telephone conversation in early October, told the Bartners they could terminate the contract. According to appellants’ testimony, the seller did not offer at that time to return their $3,000 deposit.</p>

On October 9, appellants wrote to Moore, stating that they had written the Maine Real Estate Commission complaining of ap-pellees’ “misleading representation of the property” and were preparing to file a formal complaint. On October 10, they wrote again to Moore stating that they had sent to their lending institution in Maine the executed documents necessary to accomplish the purchase. In this letter they reaffirmed a decision they had communicated to appellees, apparently on or about October 3, to complete the purchase at the $30,000 price, but the purported to reserve “the right to sue for the difference between the advertised description of the property and that stated in the deed.” They demanded, apparently in accordance with an earlier commitment by the seller in a telephone conversation, that a survey be prepared at the expense of the seller and delivered to them by the time of the closing or soon thereafter. At the closing, the seller himself offered to let the Bartners rescind the purchase agreement and to return their deposit. Appellants refused the seller’s offer of rescission and accepted title, paying the rest of the $30,000 price.</p>

Section 213 of the Maine statute, on the other hand, gives the consumer-plaintiff the remedies of “restitution” and “such other equitable relief, including an injunction, as the court may deem to be necessary and proper.” Since there is no analogue in the federal statute for the remedy by a consumer’s action and since the preventive purpose of the Commission’s action under the federal act is different from the restitutionary purpose of individual private relief under the Maine statute, the federal decisions afford uncertain guidance in the interpretation of the Maine private remedial provisions.</p>

The consumer’s action under section 213 is not for damages generally but for “restitution.” Not only must the consumer suffer a loss of money or property by his purchase as a result of a method, act or practice unlawful under section 207, but his statutory action is “for restitution” and for other necessary and proper equitable relief, including an injunction. In its technical sense, “restitution” refers to a person’s recovery of benefits he has conferred on another in circumstances making it unjust or inequitable for the other to retain those benefits. <em>See Restatement of Restitution, passim, </em>especially Introductory Note and §§ 1, 3, 4, 21, 28, 150, 151 (1937). On the facts of the present case, if appellants’ claim under the statute must be based on the restitution of benefits conferred by them on the appellees, their loss recoverable from appellees would have been the $3,000 they paid on the purchase price. They did not assert a claim for that loss. Instead, they affirmed the agreement by closing the transaction, accepting title from the seller, and paying the rest of the price. Appellants’ purported reservation of a right to recover damages measured by the alleged difference between the value of the land as represented and its actual value had no relation to the right they once had to restitution under section 213. The value of the difference in acreage might have been appropriate as a measure of damages for fraud and deceit,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> but such damages are not restitutionary in the technical sense: they do not represent the value of any benefit appellants conferred on appellees during the transaction.</p>

It is arguable, of course, that the word “restitution” could be taken in the broad sense to include whatever amount is necessary to make the plaintiff whole, regardless of any enrichment of the defendant. However, there are several reasons supporting the conclusion that the legislative purpose was to use the word in its technical sense.</p>

No reason appears for supposing that it was the purpose of the language to exclude an action for some kinds of non-restitutionary relief but include it for others. Common law actions for negligence and breach of warranty are available in appropriate cases for non-resti-tutionary damages in situations where personal injuries or damages to property have occurred.</p>

They were not entitled to reformation of the contract either directly or by abatement of the price, there having been no understanding among the persons involved as to any relationship between price and acreage. No basis existed for reformation of the price term in the contract. The appellants’ own ideas about the market value of .175 acres in that neighborhood could not be imposed on the seller in the form of an abatement of price. Hence, after appellants rejected rescission, affirmed the contract, paid the rest of the $30,000 and accepted title, they no longer had any restitutionary remedy. The “reservation” in their letter to Mr. Moore on October 10 “of the right to sue for the difference between the advertised description of the property and that stated in the deed” could not have been effective to reserve any restitutionary right after they completed their purchase of the property, for no such right existed.</p>
