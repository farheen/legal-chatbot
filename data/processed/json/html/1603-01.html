Although the defendant was; charged with arson—the malicious burning of the dwelling <a id="p1616" href="#p1616" data-label="1616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1616</a>of another—and an intent to defraud the insurer is not an element of that offense, we are inclined to the view that where evidence is introduced tending to show the <em>corpus delicti, </em>that is, that the burning was not accidental but incendiary, the State may resort to circumstantial evidence to show that the defendant committed the act, and that he did so with criminal intent. Where the defendant himself holds a policy of 'insurance on the property, this would certainly be admissible as showing a possible motive for the crime. Where the policy is not held by the defendant, but is held by the defendant’s father, and where, as here, there is evidence of statements by the accused tending to show an intention on his part to burn the house or cause it to be burned in order that his father might collect the insurance, we think there was no error in permitting the State to prove that the father had the house and contents insured and the amount of the insurance.

    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[273,1611,1102,694]]]'>The motion for severance as made by defendant Enslow Sawyer was hardly sufficient to put the trial court in error in denying it. We cannot say that any abuse of discretion was shown. The motion was largely based on apprehensions, for which no adequate basis was afforded by the facts alleged in the motion. However, it turned out during the trial that Sawyer’s apprehensions that the interests of the two defendants were antagonistic, were largely correct. His co-defendant became a witness for the State and gave testimony which, if believed, and it evidently was, in part at least, was very damaging against him. But, on the showing made by and in support ,of the motion, we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion. See Suarez v. State, 115 So. R. 519, <a href="/fla/95/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="95 Fla. 42" data-case-ids="1265251" data-case-paths="/fla/95/0042-01">95 Fla. 42</a>, and-cases therein cited.</p>

      <a id="p1617" href="#p1617" data-label="1617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1617</a>It is further contended that the court erred in permitting the chief of the fire department to testify that in his opinion the house had been set on fire by the use of gasoline. There could be no objection to that part of the chief’s testimony as to the facts concerning the fire and the conditions he found in respect to the building, or what remained of it, after the fire, upon which he based his opinion. But ordinarily in an arson case a witness cannot testify as to his opinion that the fire was, or was not, of incendiary origin, that being a question for the jury to determine. 5 C. J. 577. However, this witness was by his testimony qualified as an expert, and it has been held in several cases in other jurisdictions that an expert can testify to his opinion as to the cause of an explosion. 22 C. J. 647, 648, and cases cited. While the question is a difficult one, we hardly think, in view of the evidence, which strongly indicated that the fire was of incendiary origin, that there was any prejudicial or reversible error committed by the court in admitting this testimony.</p>
