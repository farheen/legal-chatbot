On the following day Mr. Curtis received an anonymous telephone call. The informant, indicating that he was aware of the theft and what had been lost, told him that two persons connected with it, naming one Lewis Catlin and the defendant Robert Dali, were in town preparing to leave in a small blue car which might be a “Valiant.” The theft had occurred in North Harpswell about three miles from Brunswick. Mr. Curtis immediately relayed his information to the police and road blocks were established. A short time later, police officers observed a small blue “Comet,” a Ford product, containing two men leaving Route 1 in Brunswick by exit ramp. As the car approached, Lieutenant Joy, who knew the defendant, saw him sitting on the passenger’s side of the front seat. The car was being driven by Catlin. Joy observed that Dali suddenly bent forward in his seat. The car was immediately stopped and the two men ordered out and searched. On request, Catlin then gave permission to open the trunk but nothing material to the investigation was found in it. Joy went to the door on the driver’s side of the vehicle, bent over and observed a brown paper bag protruding from under the seat on the passenger’s side. Joy took the bag, opened it and discovered items identified as part of the property stolen from Curtis. Officer Medary then drove the vehicle off the highway and searched it more thoroughly. On pushing the front seat back, he discovered under it a wig and under that a 22 caliber revolver.</p>

In evaluating the evidence of possession, therefore, we must perforce di<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>vorce from our minds the fact that such a tip was given as well as its contents. We are left then with the bare facts that Dali was a passenger in the car, that stolen property was concealed in a bag partially under the seat which he occupied and that just before the car came to a stop he was seen to bend forward. Mere presence will not support a finding of possession. The fact of presence is relevant and admissible evidence but it will not alone raise an inference of possession unless “illuminated by other facts.” United States v. Romano (1965), <a href="/us/382/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="382 U.S. 136" data-case-ids="6172939" data-case-paths="/us/382/0136-01">382 U.S. 136</a>, 141, <a href="/us/382/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="382 U.S. 136" data-case-ids="6172939" data-case-paths="/us/382/0136-01">86 S.Ct. 279</a>, 282, <a href="/us/382/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="382 U.S. 136" data-case-ids="6172939" data-case-paths="/us/382/0136-01">15 L.Ed.2d 210</a>. We squarely faced this issue of proof of possession in State v. Mosher (1970-Me.), <a href="/a2d/270/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="270 A.2d 451" data-case-ids="8107065" data-case-paths="/a2d/270/0451-01">270 A.2d 451</a>. Mosher was present in a vehicle in which stolen property was in plain view but there were no other facts linking him to possession of that property and he could as well have been an innocent passenger or even a hitchhiker. <em>Mosher </em>stands in sharp contrast to State v. Poulin (1971-Me.), <a href="/citations/?q=277%20Me.%20493" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="277 Me. 493">277 Me. 493</a> in which Poulin’s presence in the same vehicle with Mosher was adequately supported by other facts. Poulin was the driver and in control of the car which was owned by his wife. Thus, inferentially, he was also in control of its contents. He had been seen, both as to space and time, near the crime. In the instant case, however, many hours had elapsed between the discovery of the crime and the apprehension of the defendant Dali. He had never been seen during those hours in company with Catlin or near the scene of the crime. He was not the operator of the car nor is there any evidence that he owned or controlled it. The State, recognizing that it must distinguish Mosher, contends that Dali’s “furtive” movement, bending forward in his seat, fills the evidentiary gap with respect to his control and possession of the stolen property. Such an action on the part of a suspect, understandably deemed suspicious by an experienced police officer, might well have supportive effect if the issue were <em>probable cause. </em>But it will not suffice as a matter of law to prove possession <em>beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>If there was anything in the defendant’s hand when he bent forward, the officers were unable to observe it. There are simply too many rational hypotheses explanatory of such a sudden movement which are consistent with a lack of control or possession of the stolen property. The vehicle was about to be stopped or in the process of being stopped at the roadblock. The movement may have been induced by the operation of the car. A passenger may for example bend forward to adjust a seat-belt, stub out a cigarette, reach for a lighter or adjust the radio. In the instant case Dali may have engaged in pushing the wig or the gun or both under the seat. Conclusion of the officer that Dali was in fact exercising control over the stolen property rises to no higher level than lively suspicion and conjecture. We are not so naive as not to recognize the probability that Dali was guilty at least of the larceny of the Curtis property but under our legal system proof of the mere probability of guilt will not suffice.</p>

All agree, however, that evidence of such possession is relevant and admissible but these Courts require that there be additional supportive evidence of receipt and knowledge. Some Courts which, like Maine, permit a fact-finder to infer <em>larceny </em>from recent unexplained possession (State v. Poulin, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20Me.%20493" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="277 Me. 493">supra;</a> State v.
