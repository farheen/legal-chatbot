To the plaintiffs complaint the defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The defendants adeged therein that in separate proceedings, held in bankruptcy court, it had been determined factually that the partnership’s interest in the rental property had been divested by judicial sale prior to the adeged acts of interference. The trial court, bedeving it could take judicial notice of the findings of a federal bankruptcy court, sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The partnership appealed. We reverse.</p>

On or about October 22, 1992, PECO, through its agent, Gregory Golazeski, Esquire, threatened to terminate electric service at the office budding. PECO also contacted the budding’s tenants and advised them that the partnership had been delinquent in paying its electric bid and that electric service to the office budding could be terminated. On July 27, 1993, PECO allegedly contacted the tenants again and advised them that the partnership was stdl delinquent in paying its bids and warned the tenants not to pay their monthly rent to the partnership or they would risk termination of electric service. The partnership adeged that PECO’s charges of delinquency had been incorrect and asserted that its outstanding bids had been paid in fud. PECO’s actions, it was adeged, had left the tenants of the office budding with a false impression regarding their abidty to receive uninterrupted electric service and had caused several tenants either to terminate their lease agreements prematurely or to default on their rent. This tortious interference with contractual relations, it was adeged, had caused damages to the partnership.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Upon these adegations, the trial court granted PECO’s preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>
