Appellants personally guaranteed this loan between the Bank and the Authority and executed an Industrial Revenue Bond Guaranty. Appellants pledged their business real estate as collateral for the Guaranty. In order to effectuate the pledge, Appellants executed a Mortgage and Bond Accompanying a Mortgage in the sum of $650,000 in favor of the Bank. On November 18, 1988, due to non-payment, the Bank confessed judgment for the principal amounts against the Appellants pursuant to the Warrants of Attorney in the Bond Accompanying the Mortgage and the Industrial Revenue Bond Guaranty.</p>

The judgment may include interest computable from the instrument.</blockquote>

(4) the computation of the amount due requires consideration of matters outside the instrument.” It is the question of what the language “consideration of matters outside the instrument” means that is before this Court now, since Appellants argue, among other things, that the judgments were incorrectly entered under Rule 2951(a) and the Bank was required to follow the complaint procedure under 2951(b).</p>

    <blockquote id="b1120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1120.4",1120,[222,395,718,559]]]'>Clause (4) codifies the existing practice which forbids confession under subdivision (a) if matters outside the instrument must be examined to compute the amount due. Subdivision (a) refers to the “amount which may appear to be due from the instrument” and, obviously, if this cannot be computed without going outside the instrument, subdivision (a) cannot be used. In such ease, the complaint procedure of subdivision (b) is the only procedure available to confess the judgment.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1120.5",1120,[221,967,716,370]]]'>An illustration of this situation is a lease which gives the lessor the right, from time to time, to confess judgement against the lessee for the amount of rent and other charges which may be in arrears. A confession under subdivision (a) is impossible, since the instrument itself discloses no amount due at any particular time.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b1120-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1120.6",1120,[220,1351,715,179]]]'>Another illustration is an installment note which authorizes confession for the full amount of the debt if there is a default in the payment of any installment.</blockquote>
    <p id="b1120-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1120.7",1120,[177,1552,756,700]]]'>Appellants here argue that the judgments in question all require matters to be considered outside of the governing instruments because Appellants have made payments on all three loans. Therefore, Appellants argue that they do not owe the amount indicated on the face of each instrument and entered as the judgment amount. Although Appellants do not refer to the Explanatory Notes, essentially their argument is that their debts are akin to the installment loan illustration included in the Notes. Accordingly, Appellants contend that the Bank was required to file complaints for each judgment pursuant to Rule 2951(b).</p>
    <p id="b1120-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1120.8",1120,[175,2278,756,317]]]'>I agree with Appellants. Although the loan documents in question were not, in fact, installment loans on their faces, the record reveals that the loans were treated by both the Bank and Appellants as installment loans, and some payments were made on the loans.</p>

However, in deposition testimony the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank acknowledged that payments had been made by Appellants and that the outstanding principal balance on the loan was $184,958.12. Similarly, the deposition revealed that payment had been made on the $650,000 debt (Nos. 1144 and 1145 PHL 1992) and that the unpaid balance was estimated to be approximately $404,000. Neither party disputes the fact that these payments were made. Thus, the principal amounts that are in fact due are <em>not </em>evident from the instruments and require the consideration of matters outside of the instruments. Therefore, I would find that the loan instruments are similar in substance to installment loans and are therefore subject to the complaint procedure under Rule 2591(b).</p>

Once a judgment is entered for a certain amount, the judgment creditor is entitled to the full amount of the judgment and is not prevented from executing for that amount. Thus, Appellants would be exposed for the full amount notwithstanding the Bank’s word that it would only execute for the amount that it is really owed. This would, I believe, unfairly place the burden on Appellants to correct the work of the Bank, which, in keeping with the view that confessions of judgment are looked upon with disfavor, should be the party required to prove that the requirements for entering a confession of judgment were met.</p>

I view the question of what are “matters outside the instrument” for purposes of Rule 2951 to be distinct from the question of what are "matters outside the record” for purposes of striking a judgment. In the first instance, if matters outside the instrument must be considered to confess a judgment, a complaint must be filed. If the complaint is not filed when one is required, the judgment is confessed improperly and that is a defect on the record.</p>
