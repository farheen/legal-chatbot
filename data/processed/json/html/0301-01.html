In addition, the report from the Pennsylvania Highway Safety Program, appended to the PIR, indicates that a blood alcohol content [BAC] of .34% results in “an exhibition of major impairment of all physical and mental functions; irresponsible behavior; general feeling of euphoria; difficulty in standing, walking, talking, distorted perception and judgment. If BAC reaches .50% a coma develops and by .60% death can result.” Clearly, there was evidence before the sentencing court that appellant’s driving was impaired to a degree that rendered him incapable of operating his vehicle safely.

In addition, in a letter to the court from Ms. Colanduoni, appended to the PIR and made a part of the record, Ms. Colanduoni stated: “On July 15, 1992 my family and I were inolved [sic] in an accident caused by a drunk driver.

I feel for what he has caused me alone ... should cause him the fullest punishment the law allows.” (PIR addendum, 1/15/93.) At the sentencing hearing, however, Ms. Colanduoni testified that she told the probation office she had no recollection as to how the accident occurred. <em>(See </em>notes of testimony, 1/25/94 at 17-18.) Ms. Colanduoni also indicated at the hearing that her memory of other events was deteriorating as a result of her head injuries. <em><a href="/pa-super/350/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="350 Pa.

[The superior court and the Commonwealth argue for] a strained reading of an otherwise straightforward statute which is directed at giving the trial court the ability to sentence a defendant for the damage caused by him in the commission of a crime. Thus, where one steals an automobile valued at $15,000 and during a high speed chase is involved in a wreck which damages the auto, reducing its value to $5,000, it would be appropriate, in addition to incarceration, upon conviction for theft, to require the defendant to pay the victim $10,000 for the loss of value to the auto.

Gallagher, </em><a href="/pa-super/430/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="430 Pa. Super. 457" data-case-ids="936474" data-case-paths="/pa-super/430/0457-01">430 Pa.Super. 457</a>, <a href="/pa-super/430/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="430 Pa.

In the present case there is no question that serious bodily injury was sustained, however, the evidence adduced at the sentencing proceedings was quite minimal and did not establish, with any degree of certainty, that appellant’s intoxication caused the injuries sustained.</p>
    <p id="b367-10" data-blocks='[["BL_367.12",367,[986,1761,754,656]]]'>Appellant maintained throughout the proceedings that the victim’s car came into his lane of travel and that as it did so he stopped his vehicle within his lane at which time the victims’ vehicle struck his. Despite his persistent challenge to the basic factual premise underlying the implementation of an enhanced sentence, the Commonwealth presented no actual testimonial evidence relating to who or what caused the accident in question. Instead, to carry its burden, the Commonwealth apparently relies upon a pre-sen-tence report, which, essentially, is total hearsay.</p>
    <p id="b367-11" data-blocks='[["BL_367.13",367,[989,2440,763,313]],["BL_368.1",368,[217,256,758,606]]]'>The pre-sentence investigation contains the opinion of the investigating officer, Chief Roofner, that the appellant crossed <em>into the </em>victim’s lane of travel. However, the officer did not witness the collision and there is no indication in the report as to how this opinion was reached, and, of course, he did not ap<a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>pear at <em>the </em>sentencing to explain the basis of his “opinion.” The report further contains a ■version of events of one of the victims, Linda Colanduoni, indicating that as they came around the bend appellant’s vehicle was in their lane of travel and that she “places the blame for this accident solely on [appellant].” Unlike Chief Roofner, Ms. Colanduoni did testify at the sentencing hearing. However, she indicated she had <em>no recollection </em>of the accident. Thus, the trustworthiness of this version of what transpired is totally negated by her own testimony at sentencing.</p>
    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[213,885,758,1656]]]'>Unfazed by the above the majority rehabilitates and supplements the Commonwealth’s evidence in an attempt to make it appear to be sufficient. At pages 3 and 4 of their opinion they supply information relating to the extent of appellant’s intoxication and the generally associated affects of that level of intoxication. The apparent purpose of this process is to allow the inference that since appellant was so drunk he must have caused the collision and his statements to the contrary cannot be trusted. Appellant’s intoxication and interest are certainly proper factors to consider in the weighing of his testimony. However, the sentencing court never made a credibility assessment, and the mere fact that appellant was intoxicated does not mean that he caused the accident in question. Next, the majority attempts to rehabilitate Ms. Colanduoni’s testimony by hypothesizing that as a result of the collision she had been gradually losing her memory of the accident so that at the time of sentencing she could not recall the accident at all. Thus, they argue, the version contained in the pre-sen-tence report should be credited above her sentencing testimony. This hypothesis is flawed, however, because Ms. Colanduoni never testified that she had been gradually losing her recollection. Her exact response at sentencing was “I told him [the probation officer] that I have absolutely no recollection of the accident.... I don’t remember anything that whole day, or weeks- — there’s loads of things I don’t remember.”</p>
    <p id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.7",368,[1018,255,750,850]]]'>By Ms. Colanduoni’s own testimony she had no recollection of the accident <em>at the time </em>she spoke with the probation officer. She does not state that she had a recollection at the time of her interview with the probation department but then lost it sometime before the time of the sentencing when she testified. Additionally, no one else testified that Ms. Colanduoni had been suffering a gradual deterioration of memory, nor was that syndrome noted in the pre-sentence investigation despite listing the various medical consequences of the accident. As such, it is far more likely that the victim related to the probation officer her opinion and belief of what transpired, based upon assumption or what someone else told her, rather than what she personally recollected.</p>
    <p id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.8",368,[1016,1145,751,1042]]]'>As such, although the majority suggests that the Commonwealth carried its burden with respect to applying the sentencing enhancement, in my opinion the evidence is rather minimal and inherently suspect. This is unfortunate because, in all likelihood a much stronger case could have been presented. After all, there were three occupants of the vehicle in question and only one was called to testify. Were they all incapable of remembering what transpired just preceding the accident? Chief Roofner could have been presented as well to explain his “opinion” and how it was derived. Testimony regarding debris location and skid marks would have been especially helpful and, one would assume, must have been available. Yet the Commonwealth put no such evidence in. In consideration of <em>Gallagher, </em>and upon the record presented, I do not believe it was proper to sentence according to § 303.5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Thus, I dissent from that aspect of the decision.</p>

My dissenting opinion should not be construed as leniency towards drunk drivers. If appellant in fact <em>caused the accident </em>in question I believe he would be fully deserving of the enhanced sentence imposed in this case. However, the Commonwealth should be made to prove the existence of the underlying elements of the enhanced sentence just as they are made to prove the elements of the offense in question and the fact that appellant has chosen to plead guilty to <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>the offense of driving under the influence does not eliminate the Commonwealth's obligation to prove the additional elements necessary to impose the enhanced sentence.</p>
