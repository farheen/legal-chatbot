Anderson, asks us to determine whether the trial court miscalculated his prior record score and consequently imposed an excessive sentence without sufficient reasons for sentencing Appellant in the aggravated range of the sentencing guidelines. Appellant also questions whether the court relied on improper factors when imposing Appellant’s sentence. We hold the trial court properly calculated Appellant’s prior record score where Appellant’s previous sentences were not totally concurrent, and adequately stated its reasons for the sentence imposed. We further hold Appellant has waived his claim that the court considered improper factors at sentencing for failing to object at sentencing or preserve the issue in a post-sentencing motion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

Specifically, Appellant asserts that the court miscalculated his prior record score because the sentences Appellant received in 1998 on four felonies were imposed totally concurrent. Pursuant to 204 Pa.Code § 303.5(b), Appellant contends only the conviction with the greatest number of points under Section 303.7 should be counted in his prior record score. Further, Appellant submits under subsection (c), totally concurrent means each sentence imposed does not increase the term of the sentence. Appellant concludes the trial court improperly treated his four felony convictions in 1998 as separate offenses and applied an incorrect prior record score to his current offenses.</p>

Appellant concludes his judgment of sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resen-tencing. We disagree.</p>

At No. 572, Appellant was sentenced to 3-12 months; at No. 573, Appellant was sentenced to 4r-14 months; at No. 574, Appellant was sentenced to 5-16 months; and, at No. 575, Appellant was sentenced to 6-18 months plus 60 months’ probation. The record demonstrates that the original sentencing court did not intend Appellant’s prior sentences to be totally concurrent. First, the 1998 sentencing court did not “sentence the most serious conviction offense first.” Additionally, each sentence imposed actually increased Appellant’s maximum sentence. Although the sentences were to be served concurrently, there is nothing about the 1998 sentencing scheme to indicate the court intended “total concurrence.” Therefore, Appellant’s prior sentences for the four felonies in 1998 were not “totally concurrent.” <em>See </em>204 Pa.Code § 303.5(c) and Commentary. Thus, we conclude the trial court correctly calculated Appellant’s prior record score.

Third, that your conduct while incarcerated in the Butler County Jail, as reflected in the pre-sentence report, was not in accordance with the conduct that would be expected of somebody incarcerated. In fact, you had several violations. Based upon that, the Court chooses to impose the aggravated guidelines, and will impose the following sentence for the reasons stated: The [Appellant] is directed to pay the costs of prosecution for the offense of possession with the intent to deliver, an unclassified felony.
