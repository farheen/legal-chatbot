Since the fire occurred 36 days into the renewal period, the trial court concluded that the vacancy clause did not apply to preclude coverage. Estate obviously agreed with the trial court’s interpretation of the vacancy clause. On the other hand, Insurer argued that days prior to the effective date of the renewed policy, which were covered by the prior policy, should be counted in calculating the 60-day condition. In this appeal, we must determine which interpretation and application of the vacancy clause is consistent with the intent of the parties and the legislature, <em>i.e., </em>whether the days of vacancy covered by the prior policy, before the effective date of the renewed policy, should be permitted to be counted toward the 60-day condition contemplated in the vacancy clause. In deciding this question, we are mindful that the prior policy was essentially identical to the <a id="p783" href="#p783" data-label="783" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*783</a>renewed policy and there was no gap in coverage between the two policy periods.</p>

In <em>Pappas, </em>the insureds sought coverage under a fire insurance policy. The insureds’ initial policy commenced on September 1, 1988, and was renewed each year on September 1, 1989, and on September 1, 1990. The insureds’ property became vacant in May of 1989 and remained vacant up until the date of the fire well over a year later, on October 27, 1990.

Accordingly, the <em>Pappas </em>court was faced with the same question of law that we are presented with in the instant case, which is “whether the vacancy exclusion applies where, as here, the fire loss occurred during the first sixty days of the policy renewal and the vacancy had existed for more than sixty days before the date of the fire.” <em>Id. </em>at 83. The <em>Pappas </em>court concluded that “the period of a vacancy existing prior to the date coverage is <em>first </em>effective <em>[i.e., </em>the inception of coverage] should not be counted in determining whether a vacancy that excludes liability has occurred.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). However, the <em>Pappas </em>court indicated that the vacancy exclusion will apply to preclude coverage for a loss due to fire that occurs during the first 60 days of a <em>renewed </em>policy where the insured premises are unoccupied or vacant for more than 60 days, including days prior to the effective date of the renewed policy, where the renewed policy is not significantly different from the prior policy that was in effect immediately prior to the renewed policy. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Pappas </em>court provided the following explanation for this rule:</p>

That exclusion of coverage continued at least to September 1, 1989, when the second policy period began. An exclusion of coverage unquestionably thereafter existed during the second policy period at least from the end of October, 1989, to September 1, 1990, when the third policy period began. <em>No reasonable insured would believe, in those circumstances, with the uncontestable periods of noncoverage deñned above, that the vacant premises would annually be provided coverage during the first sixty days of each renewal period. </em>

Although in their complaint, Estate admitted that the renewed policy named Decedent as the insured, the Estate also averred that the policy insured “the insured named above and legal representatives.” Complaint, 3/25/02, at ¶ 6. However, Estate fails to indicate that the names of the insureds “John J. Higgins <em>&amp; </em>Barbara Higgins” were typed in to the policy, whereas the other language is part of the boilerplate form of the policy. Absent any showing that Insurer knew, at the time of renewal, that Decedent had died, that her property had been vacant, and that her estate was renewing the policy, we can find no indicia of bad faith on the part of Insurer in this case.</p>

Therefore, Estate argues that the renewed policy “stands on its own and the events occurring under the prior policy would not apply to the new one. Events occurring prior to a new policy cannot count against the insured insofar as establishing coverage is concerned.” Estate’s brief at 2.</p>
    <p id="b815-4" data-blocks='[["BL_815.4",815,[114,1008,753,1676]],["BL_815.5",815,[914,277,756,1495]]]'>¶ 19 Estate focuses on footnote 2 in <em>Penn, </em>which states that “a renewal of a policy constitutes a separate and distinct contract for the period of time covered except where the provisions of the extension certificate show that the parties intended not to make a new contract but to continue the original contract in force.” <em>Penn, </em><a href="/a2d/719/0749-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="719 A.2d 749" data-case-ids="11681815" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0749-01">719 A.2d at </a>751 n. 2 (citing <em>Schock, </em><a href="/citations/?q=24%20A.2d%20741" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="24 A.2d 741">24 A.2d at 743</a>). Nevertheless, the result in <em>Penn </em>actually supports the result we reach in this appeal. <em>Penn </em>involved a township’s effort to recover from fidelity bonds issued each year, from 1986 to 1990, each in the amount of $125,000, from Aet-na Casualty and Insurance Company (Aet-na). The bonds issued each year had the same language and the same bond number. When the township’s treasurer embezzled over $400,000 from the township during the period of time these bonds were in effect, the township sought to recover on each fidelity bond. Aetna, relying on a non-cumulation clause in each bond, agreed to pay only $125,000 in the aggregate, rather than $125,000 multiplied by the number of bonds in effect during the period of embezzlement. We examined cases involving non-cumulation clauses in other bonds and concluded that the bonds in <em>Penn </em>were ambiguous because they did not reference past or future bonds and whether such bonds would be aggregated. However, even finding the language ambiguous, we agreed with Aetna’s position after relying on parol evidence in which the township admitted that there was only a single bond running from 1986 through 1987. So, although we stated that each bond was a separate contract, we focused on the parol evidence to conclude that the non-cumulation clause allowed recovery of only an aggregate of $125,000, not $125,000 for each bond. Similarly, in the instant case, Estate admits that the renewed policy was essentially the same as the prior policy. Indeed, as noted above, it named the same insureds (even though Decedent had died by the time the renewed policy came into being, she was listed as an insured), had the same terms, and was for a five-year period, just like the prior policy. The only differences were the policy number and the actual five-year period covered. Just as <em>Penn </em>concluded that the five separate bonds issued each year were, for practical purposes, a “single bond,” the fire insurance policy here, although involving a renewal, could still be considered the same policy. Accordingly, <em>Penn </em>is more supportive of the result we reach here than it is of Estate’s arguments.</p>
    <p id="b815-6" data-blocks='[["BL_815.6",815,[914,1813,754,870]]]'>¶ 20 Also in <em>Penn, </em>we even considered the township’s argument that it could have recovered multiple times only if it had purchased bonds from a different insurer each year. Estate could have made this argument, as by indicating that it could have purchased a new policy from a different insurer. Indeed, had Estate done so, the vacancy clause would not have applied to suspend coverage during the first 60 days of the new policy. That result would have been consistent with the rule enunciated in <em>Pappas, </em>described above and adopted herein. However, the fact remains that Estate did not change insurers and the renewal policy was essentially the same as the prior policy.</p>

      <a id="p786" href="#p786" data-label="786" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*786</a>¶ 21 Estate also relies on <em>Schock </em>for the proposition that a renewal is in effect a new policy that should stand on its own. <em>Schock </em>was cited in footnote 2 of <em>Penn, </em>as indicated above. Moreover, <em>Schock </em>involved a renewed policy that had a materially different term from the prior policy, the insured was unaware of this different term, and the term greatly decreased the coverage available to the insured. In the instant case, we are dealing with a renewed policy that was identical to the prior policy in all material respects. Accordingly, we find <em>Schock </em>readily distinguishable.</p>
    <p id="b816-15" data-blocks='[["BL_816.4",816,[176,1020,758,1496]]]'>¶ 22 We emphasize that the vacancy clause would not have applied to preclude coverage if, for example, the fire occurred within 60 days of the effective date of the <em>first </em>policy, <em>ie., </em>September 20, 1996, which is the date Decedent first purchased the insurance, even if her dwelling at that time had been unoccupied for a period of more than 60 consecutive days. As noted in <em>Pappas, </em>under such circumstances, the insurer has the opportunity to determine “whether a vacancy exists at the inception of a policy and to choose not to underwrite the risk, to amend the policy provisions (where permitted), or explicitly to provide coverage at an additional premium.” <em>Pappas, </em><a href="/citations/?q=661%20N.E.2d%2081" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="661 N.E.2d 81">661 N.E.2d at 83</a>. “If a vacancy exists at the <em>inception </em>of coverage, it is hardly reasonable to believe that the coverage should terminate earlier than sixty days later when, for the premium paid, the insurer has agreed to assume for sixty days the increased risk of loss that vacant premises present.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=661%20N.E.2d%2081" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="661 N.E.2d 81">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added). However, these circumstances do not exist here, where the loss occurred during a period covered by the renewed policy that was substantially the same as the first, or prior, policy.</p>

Our interpretation in this case serves the intent of the legislature of limiting an insurer’s risk of loss on properties that are vacant for prolonged periods and serves the reasonable expectations of the parties.</p>
    <p id="b816-4" data-blocks='[["BL_816.7",816,[981,602,754,656]]]'>¶ 24 Finally, we recognize and accept Insurer’s argument that Estate could have “avoided the suspension or restriction of coverage simply by interrupting the period of vacancy,” Insurer’s reply brief at 2, as by having someone stay overnight at the dwelling, thereby alleviating the concern of the legislature regarding the safety of premises left unoccupied for prolonged periods. We agree with Insurer that “it is not unreasonable to require that a property be occupied once every two months.” <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>

In its motion for summary judgment and brief in opposition to Insurer’s motion for summary judgment, Estate notes only two differences between the renewed policy and the prior policy, <em>i.e., </em>the policy numbers and the periods of time which they cover. These are not differences relevant to our determination of whether the renewed policy has substantially the same characteristics as the prior policy. Moreover, in their brief to this Court in this appeal, Estate admits that the renewed policy covered the same property in the same amount as the prior policy, listed the same insureds as the prior policy, <em>i.e., </em>"John J.
