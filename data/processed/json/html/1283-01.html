Beane (Beane). Beane admitted liability but his insurance company, State Auto Mutual Insurance Company (State Auto), refused to settle for the policy limit of $25,000. Following trial, a jury returned a verdict of $200,000 in Johnson’s favor. Johnson requested $175,000 from her underinsured motorist carrier, Erie Insurance Group (Erie). No agreement was reached, and Johnson filed a petition to compel underinsured motorist arbitration.</p>

Johnson agreed to settle with Erie for the remaining $50,000 of the judgment and executed a release agreement in which she agreed to subrogate Erie to her right of recovery against any other liable party. Johnson then commenced a bad faith garnishment action against State Auto, Beane’s insurer, seeking $50,000 based on the existing judgment against Beane. The trial court dismissed the action, holding that Johnson had effectively assigned her right to recovery to Erie in exchange for payment of the entire sum due her. The superior court affirmed.</p>
