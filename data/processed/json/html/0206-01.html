A physician told him that he had five years to live. At about the same time, the defendant’s father left the home and the defendant failed his Air Force physical examination. By August of 1977, his condition had deteriorated to the point that he began receiving thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatments in six-hour sessions at a Portland hospital. In conjunction with this treatment, he began receiving psychiatric care and evaluation. -At trial, evidence was admitted to show that by the late fall of 1977 the defendant began experiencing severe depression and engaged in erratic and- often self-destructive behavior. Another of the problems incurred by the defendant as a result of his condition was a chronic inability to achieve gratification during sexual encounters, a condition that had existed for some time.

He left his Brunswick home, where he was living with his mother, at around 5:30 p. m. on Wednesday, November 9, 1977. By the time he arrived at the Portland apartment of a friend, Jason Riley, he had already committed the robbery and purchased the car. Indeed, at one point he displayed a pistol to Riley and asked him if he would care to join him in a future robbery. Riley declined, but he helped the defendant buy drugs and introduced him to Susan, a local prostitute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Despite extensive efforts, the defendant was still unable to achieve a sexual climax with Susan. At the end of the encounter, which took place in a Forest Avenue apartment, the defendant, before departing, declared to a number of prostitutes lounging about in the living room that he would be back around midnight and would then engage the services of two prostitutes.</p>

While there, he consumed some alcohol, played pinball, and chatted with Riley, relating the details of his sordid tryst with Susan. At one point, he asked Riley how he might go about engaging the services of a male prostitute. Riley expressed ignorance of the pertinent customs, and the defendant apparently made his own arrangements leaving the tavern with another male. Once again, all efforts to achieve satisfaction, this time in a homosexual context, proved unavailing.</p>

Leaving the car at a local garage, he returned to the Forest Avenue apartment and conversed in the living room with Susan and Mary Ann, another prostitute. After a while, the threesome entered a bedroom. The defendant removed his coat and sat down on the bed next to Susan while Mary Ann remained near the door. When Mary Ann demanded immediate payment, the defendant reached for the pocket of his coat, removed a .22 caliber pistol, and pointed it at Mary Ann.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Seeing the gun, Mary Ann darted - for the door. The defendant fired, hitting her in the back. Mary Ann scrambled out the door and around the corner as the defendant began laughing uncontrollably. Susan then ran from the room and out of the apartment with the defendant behind her. The defendant paused to fire another shot at Mary Ann, who was on her hands and knees on the living room floor, and then ran out of the apartment. From the top of the flight of stairs just outside the apartment, the defendant fired a number of shots down at Susan, one of them fatal.</p>

After securing aid for Susan, Riley returned to his apartment and found the defendant in a “quite apprehensive” state. Suspecting the worst, Riley left the apartment and informed the police that, in his words, “I think the guy you are looking for is in my apartment.” Riley then escorted two police officers to his apartment. After a brief search, the policemen opened the door of the bathroom and found the defendant seated on the floor with his back against the wall pointing his gun directly at them. He eventually agreed to drop the gun, which was identified at trial as the murder weapon, and the policemen took him into custody.</p>

Citrin, M.A.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It developed that in August of 1977 the defendant had taken the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test, a multiple-question examination designed to reveal the participant’s psychological problems. The “Citrin Report,” which was dated August 10, 1977, consisted of the author’s subjective evaluation of the defendant’s personality as evidenced by his answers to the MMPI test. When the State objected to the report on grounds of hearsay, defense counsel responded that the report was the “exact sort of thing that doctors commonly rely on in making diagnoses: nurse’s notes, laboratory reports.” The presiding Justice then pointed out that if the defendant was seeking to have the report admitted on the basis that it was the “kind of hearsay upon which [Dr. Soreff] makes a diagnosis,” he would first have to lay a proper foundation. At that point, defense counsel resumed questioning Dr. Soreff on unrelated matters. Although during the remainder of the direct examination Dr. Soreff was asked some general questions regarding the degree of his reliance on psychological testing, he was never asked to identify the Citrin Report nor did he indicate that he had relied on that or any other specific document in reaching his conclusions as to the defendant’s mental state. Accordingly, when, at the conclusion of direct examination, defense counsel again offered the Cit-rin Report for admission into evidence, the presiding Justice again excluded it.</p>

Assuming arguendo that his failure to lay a foundation at trial is not fatal to defendant’s position, we are far from persuaded that the Citrin Report meets either of the above-mentioned exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>

However, we are not aware of any authority for tjje proposition that the opinion of one person, whose identity, qualifications, and relationship to the patient are unknown, may be admitted into evidence simply because the opinion may have been offered for the purpose of assisting a physician in formulating his diagnosis. Clearly, the author of the report could not have been motivated by the considerations that underpin Rule 803(4): he, or she, was not offering the statement in the hope of securing competent medical treatment for himself, or herself. Insofar as the justification behind Rule 803(4) is unavailable, we have little hesitation in rejecting defendant’s argument that the rule ought to apply.</p>

That rule requires the proponent of the document to produce the custodian of the record, “or other qualified witness,” to testify that the offered document was “kept in the course of a regular conducted business,” and that it was the “regular practice of that business to make [such a document].” No such testimony was introduced at trial, an omission fatal to the document’s admissibility as a business record.</p>

Under questioning from defense counsel, Dr. Jacobsohn allowed that he was familiar with the Citrin Report and that his opinion was partially based thereon. After Dr. Ja-cobsohn had examined and identified the report, defense counsel, in the presence of the jury, began to read a portion of the report to him. At this, the State objected and the presiding Justice, after again examining the report, sustained the objection.</p>

That rule provides that an expert witness “may . be required to disclose the underlying facts or data [upon which his opinion is based] on cross-examination.” The failure on the part of the defense to address this argument to the trial court in the first instance narrows the scope of our review to the “manifest error/serious injustice” standard. <em>State v.
