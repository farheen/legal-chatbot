    <p id="b1182-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1182.7",1182,[193,910,758,752]]]'>This case was held in abeyance pending the decision of another division of the court in <em>Rose v. United States, </em>No. 85-111, which in turn was held pending the decision of the court en banc in <em>Ford v. United States, </em>No. 83-1105. Both of those cases have now been decided. <em>Ford v.

      <em> </em>We hold, therefore, that the evidence adduced at appellant’s trial was insufficient to prove him guilty of soliciting for a lewd and immoral purpose, in violation of <a href="/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2701" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="D.C.

      <em> </em>This case is different from <em>Ford </em>in that here the defense did not object to the admission of the expert testimony, so that appellant must bear the heavy burden of demonstrating that its admission was plain error. <em>See Watts v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/362/0706-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="362 A.2d 706" data-case-ids="8011007" data-case-paths="/a2d/362/0706-01">362 A.2d 706</a>, 709 (D.C.1976) (en banc). We need not decide whether the court committed plain error in allowing the officers to testify as experts on the “ultimate issue” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> because the expert testimony here, as in <em>Ford, </em>“shed no light on what [appellant] might or might not have said to the motorists who stopped their cars and talked with [him].” <em>Ford, <a href="/a2d/533/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="533 A.2d 617" data-case-ids="7874357" data-case-paths="/a2d/533/0617-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/533/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="533 A.2d 617" data-case-ids="7874357" data-case-paths="/a2d/533/0617-01">533 A.2d at 627</a>.

Appellant, although male, was dressed in women’s clothing — a purple dress, a blue jacket, and high-heeled shoes. As the officers watched, appellant and his companion (also a man dressed in women’s clothing) waved at approximately thirty passing cars, all of which were occupied exclusively by men. Both officers heard appellant repeatedly call out to the occupants of those cars "Hey, baby" and "Hey, pull over." At no time, however, did either officer overhear any conversation relating to sexual acts, see any money exchanged, or see any sexual acts performed. On one occasion, after speaking with the occupants of one car, appellant and his companion got into the car and drove away. About fifteen minutes later they returned in the same car and resumed their earlier activity of waving and shouting at passing motorists.</p>
