The trust documents provided for the principal to be divided equally between a marital trust for his wife and a residuary trust. Decedent’s wife, Delema G.

In her will, Mrs. Deaver exercised her power of appointment over the marital trust, making certain specific bequests and leaving the balance to her deceased husband’s collateral heirs. In January 1993, the executor filed a remainder inheritance tax return for the funds over which Mrs. Deaver had exercised her power of appointment. The inheritance tax return reflected a gross value of $7,261,-146.94 for the remainder interest of the marital trust. From that figure, the executor deducted a total of $3,610,236.50, $3,462,-822.34 of which represented federal and state estate taxes imposed upon the estate of Mrs. Deaver and attributable to the inclusion of the marital trust in her estate. After taking these deductions, the executor arrived at a net value of the marital trust of $3,650,-910.44.

The Notice indicated an additional sum due of $519,423.34. The executor paid this sum and filed a protest. After the Department refused to hear the protest, an appeal to the trial court followed.</p>

The Estate relies, <em>inter alia, </em>upon <em>Estate of Pickering, </em><a href="/pa/410/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="410 Pa. 638" data-case-ids="1884579" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0638-01">410 Pa. 638</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20132" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="190 A.2d 132">190 A.2d 132</a> (1963); <em>Estate of Oberdorfer, </em>10 Fiduc.Rep. 358 (Orphans’ Ct.Phila.1960); and <em>Estate of Baylis, </em>15 Fiduc.Rep. 490 (Orphans’ Ct.Phila.1965), for the proposition that when inheritance tax is paid after the death of the decedent, either before or upon the death of the life tenant, <a id="p690" href="#p690" data-label="690" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*690</a>taxes paid or payable from the decedent’s estate are excludable from the value of the remainder estate.
