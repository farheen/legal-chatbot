He vaulted over the counter and demanded that the bank tellers at four stations deposit the cash at each station into his shopping bag. The gunman then vaulted over the counter and walked out of the bank. One of the bank tellers, Maria Quintanilha (Quintanilha), testified at trial that she concentrated on the gunman’s face while he emptied the cash registers. After he walked outside, she watched him remove his mask. For five seconds she could see his face unobstructed.

One of the robbers leaped over the counter, told Quinta-nilha and another cashier to open their bottom cash drawers, took the money, leaped back over the counter, and left.

The search uncovered a handgun and a letter written by defendant when he was incarcerated at the ACI. The letter was written on February 11, 1989, one day after the 1989 robbery.

The Court held that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by denying defendant’s motion to sever these charges because they were all intertwined as part of a common scheme and design to murder an entire family. Further, in <em>Lassor, </em>the defendant was charged with three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, and one count of first-degree sexual assault. The offenses occurred over a three-month period from June to September 1984. Each offense involved strangulation or attempted strangulation of the victim; three offenses involved sexual assaults; one victim had a stick placed in her vagina; and another victim had a stick placed in her rectum. In sum, there was “an overall pattern of abhorrent sexual behavior.” <em>Lassor, </em><a href="/a2d/555/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="555 A.2d 339" data-case-ids="7883810,7883881" data-case-paths="/a2d/555/0339-01,/a2d/555/0339-02">555 A.2d at 345</a>.

During both the 1988 and 1989 robberies, a masked man leaped over the counter, demanded that the tellers open the top and bottom drawers, and took the money from the bottom drawers. Kroll testified that defendant told him this was his modus operandi because the money in the bottom drawers did not have dye packs. The defendant’s letter to his daughter the day after the 1989 robbery clearly showed his participation.

A reasonable inference exists that the handgun seized was the actual gun used during the 1989 robbery. Therefore, it was relevant to prove that DiLibero actually committed the crime that would make it relevant to proving the aiding and abetting count against defendant.</p>

    <p id="b766-9" data-blocks='[["BL_766.9",766,[997,1002,755,1438]]]'>The defendant’s final argument is that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the aiding and abetting count. The trial justice denied the motion because he thought that there was sufficient evidence to send the charge to the jury. He acknowledged that although the letter that defendant wrote to Dawn postdated the robbery, it still indicated defendant had prior knowledge of the robbery. Further, defendant explained in the letter what to do with the money and how to avoid being detected. The trial justice found that the jurors could reasonably infer from this letter that defendant was giving this advice to help DiLibero avoid detection. The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a guilty verdict on this charge. He contends that even though the jury found him not guilty on this count he was still prejudiced because, if the motion had been granted, then all the evidence relating to the 1989 robbery, such as the letter to his daughter and the handgun, would not have been considered by the jury in its deliberations, and it would not have returned a guilty verdict for the 1988 robbery.</p>

We believe that it was capable of supporting such a finding. To be guilty of aiding and abetting, a defendant must share in the principal’s criminal intent and participate in the “furtherance of the common design, either before or at the time the criminal act is committed.” <em>State v.
