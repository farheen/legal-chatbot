N.T., 11/18/04, at 129.

In fact, Appellee testified that she continues to make payments on the refinanced loan she assumed to pay MasterCard and Sears balances that were relegated as Appellant’s responsibility. Also, the section involving Appellee’s interest in Appellant’s business provides that Appel-lee would agree to allow Appellant to defer payment of the $22,500.00 to her until 2001, and sets forth a payment plan according to which Appellant might remit installment payments over a decade or more. Significantly, the agreement does not provide a specific start date for the first installment. Clearly, a reading of these terms evinces Appellant’s attention to pay certain credit card debt and to pay Appellee what the parties deemed to be a fair share of her interest in his business; in return, Appellee assumed the payment of other debt and agreed to relinquish any further interest she may have had in D. Crispo, Inc., d/b/a/ Dependable Auto.</p>

A close examination of the contractual provision regarding this sum indicates at the outset that Appellee shall receive $22,500.00, and in return agreed to relinquish any further interest she may have in Appellant’s then business, D. Crispo, Inc., d/b/a/ Dependable Auto. Its future existence is a non-issue, as this language addresses Appel-lee’s interest in a marital asset as of 1995. The provisions which follow concerning both the payment schedule and the clause regarding a modification of support, though not artfully drafted, evince the parties’ intent to ensure Appellant paid that amount. Certainly, Appellee could have insisted that the payment be made in one lump sum, but by agreeing to have Appellant make installment payments in accordance with his income Appellee was attempting to do Appellant a favor. Furthermore, the provision requiring payment in full in the event Appellant sought to decrease his support obligation to Appel-lee serves as a deterrent and a surety to Appellee that Appellant would provide her with her monetary share of the business.</p>

In a case where the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement on July 21, 1989, in which father agreed to be responsible for twenty-five (25%) of the cost of the college tuition and expenses accrued by each of the parties’ minor children and failed to make those payments for one son, the trial court found that father had not breached the agreement based upon the fact mother had made no demand upon father for payment of those expenses. <em>Fina v. Fina, </em><a href="/a2d/737/0760-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="737 A.2d 760" data-case-ids="11572226" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0760-01">737 A.2d 760</a>, 769 (Pa.Super.1999). In reversing the trial court on this issue, this Court reasoned as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b370-7" data-blocks='[["BL_370.7",370,[1045,1501,714,1003]]]'>If [father] failed to pay his share of [son’s] college expenses after he was consulted and agreed to the choice of school, he necessarily breached the agreement. The fact that [mother] made no demand for payment does not alter this fact, especially where the agreement contains no requirement for a demand, and the trial court’s attempt to place an additional duty on appellant is improper.... In short, just as [mother] might have demanded payment, [father] might have inquired as to the amount due, and the parties were equally culpable for the failure to communicate. Given this equality, it was improper for the trial court to focus solely on appellant’s failure to make a demand as the basis for refusing to find appellee in breach of the 1989 Agreement.</blockquote>
