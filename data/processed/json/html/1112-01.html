Lu-zerne Intermediate Unit provides special education services to various school districts in Luzerne County. Prior to the 1992-93 school year, the Intermediate Unit provided the District with school psychologists, special services and professional employees to staff learning support classes and speech and language support classes. Due to budgetary considerations and a substantial decline in its student enrollment, the District decided to realign its staff and to provide these services itself. In March 1992, the Department of Education approved the District’s proposed staffing realignment in which fifteen classes or programs were eliminated and only the least senior District employees were furloughed.</p>

Even though those five District employees were never actually “suspended,” the result of employing all twelve L.I.U. # 18 employees to staff the transferred classes and programs would have been to furlough those five District employees.

Athough the current 1991-1995 CBA between the District and the Federation was not in effect on February 4, 1982, the Federation argues that subsection (e) was intended to protect against the preemption of any <em>provision </em>of a CBA in effect on February 4, 1982.</p>
