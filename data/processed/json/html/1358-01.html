    <p id="b1426-23" data-blocks='[["BL_1426.27",1426,[996,1624,753,1133]]]'>In February 1984, plaintiff, “Norman Gershman’s Things to Wear, Inc.,” through Norman Gershman (“Gershman”), purchased for $58,660 a new 1984 Mercedes-Benz 500 SEC from defendant, I.G. Burton &amp; Co., Inc. (“Burton”), a franchised Mercedes-Benz Delaware dealer. Defendant, Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. (“MBNA”), was the importer and distributor of the vehicle. Four months later, after the car had been driven 6,253 miles, Gersh-man complained to Burton that the car’s engine had overheated and was inoperable. The overheating was later attributed to a crack in the engine block. Defendants returned the car thirty days later, after replacing the engine’s “short block.” Gersh-man would later testify that he was told, “They are replacing it with a brand new engine,” and he did not learn until June 1986 that Burton had in fact only replaced the engine block. The repairs were made under MBNA’s warranty at a cost to MBNA of $7,227.28.</p>

After repair and while the car was being returned by Burton’s service personnel to Gershman, the engine again overheated, attributed to a defective thermostat, resulting in extensive damage to the motor. By then, Gershman had driven the car 22,134 miles. MBNA replaced the entire engine assembly at a cost of $12,070; but Gersh-man then refused to accept redelivery of the car and demanded a full refund of the car’s purchase price or a new vehicle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Burton declined, stating that MBNA’s warranty obligation did not go beyond repairing the vehicle at its expense. In November 1986, Gershman commenced this litigation, asserting multiple claims for relief, including breach of express and implied warranties and violation of state and federal law. Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims and Superior Court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motions. <em>Norman Gershman’s Things to Wear, Inc. v.

The court permitted four of plaintiffs claims to be submitted to the jury: (i) plaintiff’s primary claim against both defendants for breach of their warranty to “repair or replace”; (ii) plaintiff’s claim for relief under 6 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2-608 for recovery of the car’s purchase price for the remedy of “revocation of acceptance”; (iii) plaintiff’s claim against both defendants for violation of the Delaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 6 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2531, et seq.; and (iv) plaintiff’s claim against MBNA for violation of the Delaware Lemon Law, 6 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 5001, et seq.</p>
    <p id="b1427-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1427.7",1427,[1024,256,751,560]]]'>The jury, by special interrogatories, found defendants not in violation of the Delaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act, but MBNA liable for violation of the Delaware Lemon Law. Both defendants were found to have breached their warranty to “repair or replace,” the warranty to have “failed of its essential purpose,” and plaintiff to have “effectively revoked his acceptance” of the car. On these findings, the court entered a verdict against both defendants for $58,660.</p>

Plaintiff cross-appeals from Superior Court’s ruling setting aside its verdict against MBNA for violation of the Lemon Law and for new trial on the deceptive trade practices counts.

While conceding that timeliness of revocation is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact, defendants contend that this case is the exception to the rule. Defendants refer to “uncontradicted” evidence that over a period of eighteen months, from November 1984 to May 1986, Gershman drove the car approximatély 12,600 miles without report<a id="p1362" href="#p1362" data-label="1362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1362</a>ing any engine overheating problem, and with the car having been serviced by Burton but once.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Since Gershman could not have been relying on any promise by defendants “to make further repairs” over that period, defendants assert that Gershman’s revocation remedy for engine malfunction accrued at the latest by November 1984, when he had “actual knowledge” of the warranty’s failure. Defendants assert that plaintiff’s 18-month delay, until May 1986, after obtaining knowledge of “grounds” for revocation, rendered the remedy untimely as a matter of law because neither induced by any assurance by defendants nor exercised “within a reasonable time after the buyer discovered] or should have discovered the ground for it.” 6 <em>Del.C. </em>§ 2-608(2). Defendants contend that there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law to sustain a jury finding that plaintiff’s delay was “reasonable” under section 2-608(2) as either caused or induced by any actions or promises of defendants to make further repairs of the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b1428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1428.4",1428,[191,1478,756,1137]]]'>The predicate for the availability to plaintiff of the remedy of “revocation of acceptance,” for purposes of recovery of the car’s purchase price, was the jury’s finding that MBNA’s exclusive “repair or replace warranty failed of its essential purpose.” <em>See </em>6 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2-719(2). A warranty on a motor vehicle fails of its essential purpose when it is not repaired in conformity with the warranty within a reasonable time or within a reasonable number of attempts. <em>Gershman I, </em><a href="/a2d/558/1066-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="558 A.2d 1066" data-case-ids="11325087" data-case-paths="/a2d/558/1066-01">558 A.2d at 1070, 1071</a>; <em>Beal v.

Indeed, defendants concede that plaintiff had, as late as November 1984, “valid grounds” for revocation of acceptance, presumably for engine overheating due to a “porous block.”</p>
    <p id="b1428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1428.7",1428,[997,257,754,1298]]]'>This Court’s standard of review of the trial court's denial of defendants’ motion for a directed verdict and motion for judgment n.o.v. is well settled. The evidence of record must be viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party; and the trial judge must determine whether under any reasonable view of the evidence, the jury could justifiably find in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants. <em>Moody v.

Plaintiff testified that after the 1984 repairs, he continued to experience problems with the car’s engine involving hesitation, stalling and the motor’s running “rough.” Gershman stated that he telephoned Burton’s service manager to report the problems and was told that he would have to “live with the car’s behavior of [engine temperature] rising almost to the red zone.” Assuming that the car’s entire engine assembly had been replaced in June, plaintiff, in effect, accepted Burton’s explanations and continued to drive the car. Plaintiff contends that his revocation remedy was thereby tolled by Burton’s misrepresentations in June concerning the engine replacement work and by Burton’s assurances after November 1984 that his con<a id="p1363" href="#p1363" data-label="1363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1363</a>tinuing complaints about the car’s operation were imagined rather than real.</p>

      <em>Freedman </em>is factually distinguishable from this case in several respects. In <em>Freedman, </em>the issue of revocation arose in a distinct factual and legal framework. The buyer revoked his acceptance only “after the [automobile] warranty had expired,” <a href="/a2d/564/0691-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="564 A.2d 691" data-case-ids="11326271" data-case-paths="/a2d/564/0691-01">564 A.2d at 700</a>, and based on inconsequential complaints about the car. Here, revocation occurred within the warranty period and a finding of the warranty’s failure of its essential purpose. The <em>Freedman </em>court found the plaintiff-buyer to have completely failed to prove that the defects in his automobile substantially impaired its value. In <em>Freedman, </em>plaintiff “failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case” for revocation of acceptance. Here, defendants concede that plaintiff had “valid grounds” for revocation due to a persistent engine overheating problem. Finally, we do not read <em>Freedman </em>as establishing a “bright-line” test for determining whether a revocation is timely under section 2-608. <em>Freedman </em>does not stand for the proposition that a buyer may be denied recovery under section 2-608 simply by driving his vehicle for a defined period of time or mileage after the last repair effort.</p>

Finding no abuse of discretion, we therefore affirm the trial court’s ruling. The parties agree that an issue remains before Superior Court as to the award of attorney fees in light of the disposition of this appeal. We express no view as to any further fee the trial court might award for services on appeal.</p>
