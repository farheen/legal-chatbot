Upholding that defense, the Superior Court held in favor of the husband and dismissed the petition. The wife appeals.</p>
    <p id="b376-19" data-blocks='[["BL_376.20",376,[991,1056,751,466]]]'>The Trial Court had before it substantially the same evidence that was before a different Judge of the Superior Court in an earlier action for divorce brought by the husband against the wife on the ground of constructive desertion. In the earlier action, upon the same facts, the husband’s petition was dismissed on the ground that he was not justified in leaving; and in so holding, the Court stated:</p>

This is evidenced by their suicidal tendencies and also without accepting as absolutely true either version of the incidents, by the mere fact that their relationship was such that deadly weapons were a leading factor in identifying certain incidents. There is, as in most cases of this nature, much evidence of mere incompatibility, but in my opinion when viewed as a whole, the complete picture is one of justifiable separation. * *</blockquote>

Approving the doctrine of constructive desertion, as adopted in Harrington v. Harrington, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.W.%20Harr.%20333" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 W.W.

These are the tests of justification in a constructive desertion case; and it was these tests that the Trial Judge found to be unmet when he dismissed the husband’s petition for divorce on the ground of constructive desertion. Otherwise stated, the Court in the earlier case manifestly found that the husband was not justified in leaving his wife because he had not satisfactorily proved that the wife’s conduct was such as to be absolutely inconsistent with the marriage relation, nor such as to make it impossible to continue cohabitation with safety, health, and self-respect.</p>

We think the issue was the same in each case. Under the liberal doctrine of constructive desertion prevailing in this State, the requisite misconduct constituting justification for leaving need not rise to the proportion of a ground for divorce. Harrington v. Harrington, supra; compare 1 <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>Nelson, Divorce and Annulment (2dEd.) § 4.16.

    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[190,537,753,860]]]'>Since the issue of justification was the same, and since it had been tried and determined in the earlier case between the same parties, the refinement of the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>known as collateral estoppel applies. Under that doctrine, where a question of fact essential to the judgment is litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive between the same parties in a subsequent case on a different cause of action. In such situation, a party is estopped from relitigating the issue again in the subsequent case. Petrucci v.
