    <p id="b474-29" data-blocks='[["BL_474.25",474,[1028,1175,746,560]]]'>This matter came before the Court on September 12, 1995, pursuant to an order directing the plaintiff to appear and show cause why this appeal should not be summarily denied and dismissed. In this case the plaintiff has appealed from an order of the Family Court appointing a commissioner to sell her residence, originally owned jointly by her and her former husband and still occupied by her. The daughter now owns her interest together with her former husband.</p>

It is clear that the wife was awarded exclusive use of the property but not permanent use thereof.</p>
