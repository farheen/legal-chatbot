Claimant and Greene indicated that the February 25, 2003 Benefits Rights Interview was confusing and lacked clear direction as to the need for a waiver and/or who had responsibility for initiating the waiver process. Their assertion was supported by testimony from Anthony Scalise, a former coworker who attended the interview. The referee denied benefits, but the Board reversed and applied state regulations to backdate Claimant’s waiver application to February 25, 2003 and then granted benefits by decision issued April 30, 2004. The Department of Labor and Industry requested reconsideration; thereafter, the Board vacated its April 2004 decision pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20617.50" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="20 C.F.R. § 617.50">20 C.F.R. § 617.50</a>(d), which precludes application of state regulations regarding the extension of any time limits specified in the Trade Act.
