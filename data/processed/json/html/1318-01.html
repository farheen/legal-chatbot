It was not long before defendant fell behind in making the payments, and since November 1975 Virginia Small has repeatedly resorted to the courts to enforce the judgment for alimony. On November 5, 1975 she filed a Petition for Ar-rearages and for Contempt, which was dismissed without prejudice on December 8, 1975. Again on December 31,1975 plaintiff filed a Petition for Arrearages and for Contempt. Regarding that Petition, the Superior Court found defendant in arrears in the amount of $2,820.00, and further adjudicating that defendant had a present ability to pay a portion of those arrearages, the Court ordered judgment for plaintiff in the full amount of the arrearages and that defendant be committed to the county jail “until he . . . [paid] . . . $500.00.” The order committing defendant to jail was stayed for several weeks to give defendant an opportunity to meet the payment requirement. Defendant did make the payment.

Defendant also testified that he no longer owned two parcels of real estate, awarded to him in the divorce settlement, because he had “sold” them for two dollars (one dollar per parcel) to a third party as “security.” Defendant explained that his purpose in conveying the real estate was to provide a form of “insurance”: the third party was to hold the property, and if defendant ever became, ill, or otherwise incapacitated, the property was to be sold to meet his expenses. At the time of the hearing both properties remained in the name of the third party. Defendant had also turned over his tools to the same person, which were being kept in a workshed on one of the parcels of real estate conveyed. Defendant was freely using the tools as well as both real estate parcels.

As we have already emphasized, civil contempt proceedings are plainly a most effective tool to seek to ensure that the persons entitled to receive alimony or support will enjoy the benefits of their entitlement. Were it the legislative intendment in the particular context of the enforcement of court orders for the payment of alimony or support to take the highly extraordinary step of depriving courts not only of a most effective remedial tool but also of a power inherently possessed by judicial courts and which, in addition, the legislature has otherwise taken pains expressly to confer on them, we think that the legislature would have used language expressly, directly, affirmatively and unequivocally conveying precisely such meaning. The legislature would not have left such intendment to be derived by indirection merely from the use of the single word “shall”, a word which courts frequently interpret as expressing an enabling authorization rather than as imposing a particular mandate for a particular course of proceeding to the exclusion of any other.</p>
