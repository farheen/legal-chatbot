Moreover, we said that, in the event retrial is elected, “if a jury finds that the third element of AWIMWA — absence of mitigating circumstances — has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury may not convict of assault with intent to murder while armed (AWIMWA); it may find guilt only of the lesser included offense of assault with intent to kill while armed (AWIKWA).” However, we amended our opinion on February 23 and March 30, 1995.</p>

We said nothing about the trial error also impacting any possible lesser included offense.

That question has not been conclusively answered. Although, as indicated earlier in the text, the standard criminal jury instructions include the “specific intent to kill” as an element of AWIMWA, as well as of AWIKWA, we have never held that a specific intent to kill is the only species of malice that will qualify for AW-IMWA. If at least one other type of malice qualifies, such as a “specific intent to inflict serious bodily harm” or “a wanton and willful disregard of an unreasonable human risk,” <em>Comber v.

The trial court’s obligation was to dispose of the matter in a manner consistent with <em>Howard I. </em>In entering judgment of conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, the trial court disposed of the matter in a manner consistent with footnote 10A and textual language in <em>Howard I </em>specifying that, unless the government proves the absence of mitigating circumstances, “the jury may not convict of assault with intent to murder while armed (AWIMWA); it may find guilt only of a lesser offense, such as assault with intent to kill while armed (AWIKWA) or assault with a dangerous weapon.” <em>Howard I, <a href="/a2d/656/1106-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="656 A.2d 1106" data-case-ids="7883895" data-case-paths="/a2d/656/1106-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/656/1106-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="656 A.2d 1106" data-case-ids="7883895" data-case-paths="/a2d/656/1106-01">656 A.2d at 1114</a>.

Ct. 1241" data-case-ids="11744570" data-case-paths="/us/517/0292-01">116 S.Ct. 1241</a>, <a href="/us/517/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="116 S.
