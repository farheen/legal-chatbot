At most, the defendants would be responsible for the delay between the workers’ compensation decision in October, 1993 and the motion for summary judgment, which first raised the defense of collateral estoppel.

In light of our previous discussion, though, this argument is without basis. As we stated, the referee found unequivocally appellant’s injury was not work-related, and appellant had failed to sustain her burden of proof. This failure was grounded not in appellant’s inability to establish her sar-coidosis as an occupational disease injury, for her claim proceeded without that determination, but rather, in appellant’s inability to prove the causation of her injury was aggravated, accelerated or related in any way to her work for Xerox. This was the central issue in appellant’s workmen’s compensation claim, just as it is instantly, and appellant was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue before the referee. As that judgment is now final, appellants are estopped from pursuing the identical issue in a common law tort action. To find otherwise would be to undermine the concept of workmen’s compensation which has served the workers and economic structure of our society so well.</blockquote>

By that finding, the referee not only decided that Capobianchi’s injuries were not work-related, but also established the cause of the injuries. Appellants aver in their complaint that a defective product caused the same neck injuries already attributed to a degenerative condition.
