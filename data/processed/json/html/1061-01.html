Petitioners claim that the director misinterpreted the statute and, in any event, that the imposition of a penalty on the particular facts of this case contravenes due process of law. Notwithstanding the patchy record before us, we conclude on the basis of oral argument, and, in particular, an important concession by petitioners, that the claims lack merit.

The director’s failure to exercise his discretion under D.C.Code § 32 — 1515(f) to consider mitigating circumstances and waive payment of the penalty cannot plausibly be considered discriminatory or a denial of due process on the present facts. “The Mayor may waive payment of the additional [penalty] compensation after a showing by the employer that owing to conditions over which he had no control such installment could not be paid within the period prescribed for the payment.” D.C.Code § 32-1515(f).

Section 32-1515(f) provides that the employer/carrier must effect payment “within 10 days after it [the compensation award] becomes due” to avoid the penalty fee. Although never expressly stated by either the ALJ or the director, both the penalty order and the director’s decision necessarily imply that the compensation award became due, and the ten-day time limit therefore began to run, on July 30, 2002 — the day on which the compensation order was mailed to the parties. See notes 4 and 6, <em>supra. </em>This implicit assumption runs glaringly contrary to both DOES regulation and prior administrative decisions — some of which form the very basis of the director’s interpretation of the term “paid” — determining that a compensation order becomes due on the date on which the employer/carrier receives the compensation order via certified postal mail. <em>See, e.g., </em>7 DCMR § 228.4 (“Whenever the Act or this chapter provides a time period in which an action is to be taken, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time shall run from the actual receipt of a document.”); <em>Matysek, </em>2002 D.C. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 127, *4 (explaining that the “undisputed facts show that the May 4, 2000 Compensation Order was mailed to all the parties by certified mail on May 4, 2000 and was received by claimant’s counsel and employers’ counsel on May 8, 2000. The Compensation Order issued May 4, 2000 ... was due and payable by May 18, 2000”); <em>Imes, </em>2000 D.C. Wrk. Comp.

We are not thwarted, however, by the absence of express findings nor the seemingly unsupported assumptions in this case because counsel for petitioners explicitly conceded during oral argument that the limitations <a id="p1071" href="#p1071" data-label="1071" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1071</a>period commenced on August 2, 2002 when he received the compensation order.

The precise dates on which Liberty Mutual issued and then mailed the award check are not clear in the record.

August 9, 2002.” Of course, issuance does not necessarily mean dispatch by the postal mail; it also may more narrowly refer to the date on which the check was processed. Sellers urges this narrower reading by attempting to supplement the ALJ’s express findings with a postmarked envelope appended to his brief purportedly showing that Liberty Mutual did not actually mail the check until August 10. By Sellers's own admission, however, this envelope was never introduced into the record. Because our disposition does not turn on the date of mailing we do not resolve this dispute between the parties. It may safely be assumed for the sake of discussion that the compensation check was issued on August 9 and mailed on August 10.</p>

Relying on <em>Dorsey, </em>the director stated that "there is no room for discretion, either the compensation is paid timely and there is no penalty, or the compensation is late and the penalty must be imposed if the Claimant seeks it.” Taken at face value, this statement is inconsistent with the plain language of § 32-1515(f). However, the director's minimal explanation also could be interpreted on the particular facts of this case to mean that he had no choice but to impose the penalty because petitioners did not make a sufficient showing of conditions beyond their control. The skimpy record prevents us from ferreting out the facts which would illuminate the better interpretation, but, for the reasons identified in the text, petitioners have not met their burden of demonstrating constitutional error on appeal that would require us to explore further the director’s possible misapprehension.</p>

Petitioners’ alternate rationales for the existence of a due process violation arising from the director's failure to waive the penalty are equally meritless because they repeat flawed arguments made elsewhere in their brief. <em>See </em>Pet. Br. at 8 (urging the court to consider the fact that Liberty Mutual was never properly served, and that it nonetheless surmounted the lack of notice by timely paying the compensation award on the tenth day). Petitioners do not argue that they relied to their detriment on the director’s decision in the <em>Hill </em>case implying that posting was the dis-positive date under the statute. See note 9, <em><a href="/citations/?q=503%20A.2d%201099" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="503 A.2d 1099">supra.</a> </em>Even if they had, the contrary decisions in <em>Dorsey </em>and <em>Imes </em>would have undermined the reasonableness of their reliance for due process analysis.</p>
