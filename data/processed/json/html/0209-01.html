    <p id="b244-15" data-blocks='[["BL_244.15",244,[1010,375,755,707]]]'>This case came before the Court on May 10, 2000, on the appeal of the plaintiff, Gail DeRobbio (plaintiff or DeRobbio), from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendant, the Stop and Shop Supermarket Company<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (defendant or Stop &amp; Shop). The plaintiff was directed to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown. Therefore, we shall decide the case at this time.</p>

    <p id="b244-17" data-blocks='[["BL_244.17",244,[1010,1186,752,660]]]'>On February 17, 1993, plaintiff filed a Superior Court complaint against defendant, alleging that she suffered injuries following a slip and fall accident on January 22, 1993, in Super Stop <em>&amp; </em>Shop in Johnston, Rhode Island. The plaintiff alleged that Stop <em>&amp; </em>Shop knew or should have known of an unsafe condition on its premises that caused her to fall. A jury trial was conducted on March 16-17, 1999, at which two witnesses testified, plaintiff and Debra Gregoire, a Stop &amp; Shop employee. A summation of that testimony follows.</p>

She testified that upon entering the aisle where the baby formula was located, she noticed that there were no full cases available to purchase. She walked toward the back of the store to obtain a box in which to put the formula. She returned to the aisle to fill the box. She testified that when she arrived, an employee, who later was identified as Debra Gregoire (Gregoire), was in the aisle working from a blue cart.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>plaintiff testified that she asked Gregoire to move out of the way so she could retrieve the baby formula from the shelf. She said that after Gregoire moved aside, she slid into the space between the cart and the shelf and began placing cans of baby formula in the box. Both DeRobbio and Gregoire testified that the space between the cart and the shelf was approximately eighteen inches in width. The plaintiff testified that after she finished collecting the cans of baby formula, Gre-goire’s blue cart again was blocking the area from which she had entered the space. The plaintiff attempted to exit the space between the blue cart and the shelves on the opposite side of the blue cart. She testified that she tripped and fell as she attempted to move, and that as she got up from the floor, she saw a box on the floor, which she believed had caused her fall.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[136,1334,752,725]]]'>Gregoire testified that she did not see plaintiff fall, but upon realizing plaintiffs plight, went over to her and asked her whether she was injured. She said plaintiff responded that she was fine. Gregoire testified that she then helped plaintiff pick up the cans of formula that she had dropped when she fell. Gregoire testified that it was at that point that she noticed a box on the floor. She testified that she did not notice the box before DeRobbio fell, that she did not place a box on the floor, and that she did not see anyone else put a box on the floor while she was working in the aisle.</p>

Further, in <em>Pan-dozzi, </em>in which a woman slipped and fell in a bingo hall allegedly because of a bingo marker on the floor, we held that where there was no evidence that any agent or officer of defendant had caused the marker to be dropped on the floor or had known of the presence of the marker and negligently failed to remove it, a directed verdict was legally required. <em>Pandozzi, </em><a href="/a2d/496/0928-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="496 A.2d 928" data-case-ids="11319569" data-case-paths="/a2d/496/0928-01">496 A.2d at 929-30</a>.</p>

Therefore, reasonable minds could disagree on the question of whether defendant was on notice of the dangerous condition. Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we are of the opinion that reasonable minds could differ concerning whether Gregoire, who was in the immediate location of the accident, knew or should have known of the dangerous condition (that is, the box on the floor), unlike in <em>Massart, Pandozzi, </em>and <em>Gleason, </em>in which it was clear that no employee or agent was present in the area where the accident occurred.
