Ahmed asserts that the trial court erred by: (1) admitting a police officer’s testimony describing statements made by the victim, Ahmed’s wife, at the time of the event; (2) excluding an audiotape that Ahmed had created from voicemail messages that purportedly contained threats from his wife; (3) excluding a video Ahmed had taken of the victim using his cell phone immediately following a 911 call and as the police officer arrived on the scene; and (4) determining that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Finding no error in the trial court’s conduct of the proceedings, we affirm.</p>

    <p id="b1070-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.6",1070,[212,1540,755,767]]]'>[¶ 2] Ahmed and the victim are husband and wife. At the time of the incident they lived together in Lewiston with their three children. Based on the record developed at trial, the court could have reasonably found the following facts: Ahmed and his wife are originally from Somalia. Ahmed speaks English capably. His wife sometimes has difficulty with the language. She testified with the assistance of an interpreter at trial. However, she was able to speak in English about the events at issue for portions of a 911 call and in discussions with a Lewiston police officer who responded to the 911 call.</p>
    <p id="b1070-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.7",1070,[211,2332,752,354]],["BL_1070.8",1070,[1022,274,751,459]]]'>[¶ 8] On the morning of September 23, 2005, Ahmed’s wife placed a 911 call to the Lewiston Police Department. Initially she spoke in Somali. She then spoke in English stating “my husband he kill me,” and “my husband he hit me — he is hitting me.” In response to the 911 operator’s question: “Is this a domestic?” Ahmed’s wife stated: ‘Yes.” By stipulation of the parties, the court admitted the statements on the 911 call for impeachment purposes only, after the victim had testified during trial, denying that Ahmed had hit her and denying that her condition and injuries observed by the police officer at the scene were the result of an assault by Ahmed.</p>
    <p id="b1070-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.9",1070,[1015,772,754,1288]]]'>[¶ 4] Following the 911 call, a Lewiston police officer was dispatched to the scene, arriving within five minutes of the call. The officer testified that when she arrived at the scene, Ahmed opened the door and that he was “kind of smiling” and using his cell phone to take pictures of the victim. Upon entry, the officer testified that she observed the victim “crouched on the floor, crying hysterically and clutching her stomach.” At the time, the victim was four months pregnant with her fourth child with Ahmed. The officer asked the victim what happened, but she was unable to answer. After a minute or two, the victim, still crying, told the officer that she was “in pain” and that Ahmed had “grabbed her by the arms and pushed her down the stairs and had hit her in the head.” The officer also testified that the victim showed the officer her upper arms and stated “[t]his is where he grabbed me.” At the hospital emergency room, the officer observed fingerprint bruises on the victim’s upper arms.</p>
    <p id="b1070-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.10",1070,[1014,2100,749,246]]]'>[¶ 5] At trial, the victim testified that Ahmed was interpreting for her when she spoke to the officer. However, the officer denied this, asserting that she had spoken directly with the victim.</p>
    <p id="b1070-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1070.11",1070,[1012,2385,749,303]],["BL_1071.1",1071,[179,279,754,769]]]'>[¶ 6] Ahmed’s theory of the case was that the victim had fabricated her claims that Ahmed had hit and hurt her because they were having an argument at the time, and the victim was upset because she believed that Ahmed was seeing another <a id="p1015" href="#p1015" data-label="1015" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1015</a>woman. To attack the credibility of the victim’s anticipated testimony at trial and her statements to the officer on the day of the event, Ahmed proposed to introduce a tape recording he had made from voice-mail messages from the victim, received on his cell phone at various times between March and November 2005. The court permitted Ahmed to make a testimonial offer of proof as to the contents of the tape. M.R. Evid. 103(b). However, the tape itself was never played for the court, and the defense did not make the tape part of the trial court record or the record on this appeal. M.R.App. P. 5(a).</p>
    <p id="b1071-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1071.4",1071,[182,1074,753,1175]]]'>[¶ 7] During the offer of proof, Ahmed testified that the voicemail messages included threats by the victim to kill him and to have him deported. Ahmed appeared uncertain as to the timing of particular calls. In response to questions by the State, Ahmed testified that he did not know the number of messages recorded on the tape and that he was unsure of the number of recorded calls, if any, that were made after September 23. In response to further questioning from his attorney, however, Ahmed indicated that there were some calls that had been recorded after September 23, and he testified that at least one of the calls after September 23 involved a threat to use a knife to Mil him. After completion of the testimonial offer of proof and extended argument by counsel, the court ruled that it would exclude the tape, but that the victim could be questioned regarding any threats to Ahmed that she had stated on voicemails.</p>
    <p id="b1071-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1071.5",1071,[181,2284,752,404]],["BL_1071.6",1071,[980,277,752,717]]]'>[¶ 8] The victim was called as the first witness at trial. She testified that she did not want the matter prosecuted and that she wanted Ahmed to remain with her and the family. She testified that she was angry with Ahmed because she believed that he was seeing another woman, and that when she gets angry she makes threats and says things she does not mean. She denied that Ahmed had hit her or caused her pain on the morning of the incident, testifying instead that she had injured herself by hitting her head against a wall in a fit of anger. She also testified that she did not recall what she had said either on the 911 call or when speaMng with the officer after the officer had arrived at her apartment. Although she testified to injuring herself and lying on the floor when the officer entered her apartment, she also testified: “I don’t remember anything I did or said that day.”</p>
    <p id="b1071-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1071.7",1071,[981,1022,753,610]]]'>[¶9] In response to the questions regarding the voicemails, the victim testified that she had left threatening messages on Ahmed’s cell phone “cause I was mad.” She also testified that she had threatened to get Ahmed deported. “I was saying that to him so he can get scared and, you know, leave the woman alone.” The victim testified that she had made the 911 call to scare Ahmed, to stop him from seeing another woman, and to bring him back to his family.</p>
    <p id="b1071-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1071.8",1071,[979,1659,756,1028]],["BL_1072.1",1072,[219,278,750,194]]]'>[¶ 10] Ahmed testified similarly to the victim that he had not hit or hurt the victim that morning. He testified that they had a dispute regarding access to his car keys and that the victim had placed the 911 call and then began banging her head into the wall. He asserted that after the victim had begun banging her head into the wall, and as the police officer was arriving, he had used his cell phone to take a video, with no sound, of the victim. The defense asked the court to view the video taken by the cell phone. The court declined, indicating it would be repetitive of the testimony already offered by Ahmed and his wife. As with the tape of the voicemail messages, the cell phone video was not made part of the trial court record and is not part of the record on this appeal. Ahmed also testified that he had <a id="p1016" href="#p1016" data-label="1016" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1016</a>received threatening calls and phone messages from his wife, but the court sustained the State’s objection to questions regarding the content of the messages.</p>
    <p id="b1072-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1072.4",1072,[215,497,754,866]]]'>[¶ 11] After trial, the court found Ahmed guilty as charged. In stating its findings and conclusions, the court found that neither the victim’s testimony presented during the trial, nor Ahmed’s testimony, were credible. The court found the police officer’s testimony and the statements by the victim reported by the police officer to be reliable and appropriate for consideration as excited utterances pursuant to M.R. Evid. 803(2). The court imposed a sentence of 120 days to the county jail with all but seven days suspended, and probation for a period of two years with a number of conditions of probation. The court also imposed a $300 fine. Ahmed then brought this appeal.</p>

The record also shows that when the officer arrived, the victim was lying on the floor and crying “hysterically,” and when they spoke in the kitchen, she was still crying. To support its reliance on the statements pursuant to M.R.

As the court did here, the court is free to determine which witnesses to believe and which evidence to accept or reject as trustworthy or untrustworthy. In a case involving violence or assault, the court is free to disbelieve a victim’s testimony that the assault did not occur or that the victim does not recall essential events, as long as there is other evidence in the record by which a fact-finder could rationally conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime was committed. <em>See State v.

From the discussion with the court it appears that the video was several brief videos, recorded at various intervals from a short time after the 911 call until the time the police arrived.
