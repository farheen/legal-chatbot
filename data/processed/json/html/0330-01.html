We affirm. The facts of the case insofar as pertinent to this appeal are as follows.</p>

A telephone cord was wrapped around Smith’s neck, and his knees were slightly elevated above the ground. The right side of the body leaned against the right-hand post of the phone booth. The cord had been looped one and one-half times around Smith’s neck and was still attached to the telephone.</p>
    <p id="b397-15" data-blocks='[["BL_397.15",397,[993,630,749,186]]]'>At about 11:50 p.m. Patrolman Scanlon was joined by Sergeant Steven H. Hall. Sergeant Hall believed that Smith was dead when he first encountered the body.</p>
    <p id="b397-16" data-blocks='[["BL_397.16",397,[990,850,752,766]]]'>Earlier that evening Smith had been in the Safari Lounge and had been told to leave after a heated verbal exchange with Nancy Duffy (Duffy), who served as a bartender at the lounge. Although Smith had been barred from the lounge some years before, he had made it his custom to enter the lounge almost every night for about three years. On each of these occasions Duffy would tell him to get out. Smith would curse at her and then leave. On the night of October 5,1987 Duffy ordered him out of the lounge, and after about five minutes of directing verbal abuse toward her, Smith left. Duffy thought that this was merely a normal encounter.</p>
    <p id="b397-17" data-blocks='[["BL_397.17",397,[987,1650,753,571]]]'>During the exchange defendant Richard Houde (Houde), was in the bar. Duffy had known Houde for about two years. During that time he came into the bar about three or four times a week. Duffy had bought jewelry from Houde quite a few times. On this particular night Houde asked Duffy if Smith was bothering her. She had answered in the negative and said that he would leave “on his own.” Smith did leave at about 9:30 p.m. Somewhat later, at about 11:15 p.m., Houde left the bar also.</p>

Duffy ran outside and saw a man hanging from the phone by his neck. At the time she did not identify the body but went back inside and called the police. About 12:30 a.m. Duffy picked up the telephone and recognized the voice of the caller as that of Houde. Houde stated, “[Y]ou know the <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>‘moulon yam’ that was bothering you? I beat him up” or “I took care of him” or “I did it,” Duffy recalled. She also testified that Houde may have said that “he won’t bother you again” or something to that effect. Duffy explained that “moulon yam” means a black person.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[229,610,756,931]]]'>At about 3 a.m. Houde entered the Dun-kin Donuts shop on Weybosset Street. This shop was located about one block from the Safari Lounge and Westminster Mall. Houde often patronized the Dunkin Donuts shop and was said by the night manager to be a regular customer. While Houde was in the shop, Patrolman John Carchia of the Providence police department came in and ordered coffee. Houde inquired of Carchia whether he was “wanted” for anything or if there were any warrants outstanding for him. Carchia, who knew Houde, obliged him by making an inquiry by radio. While Carchia waited for a response, Houde asked him about the incident on the mall. Although at the time the general assumption, according to Carchia, was that the death was a suicide, defendant asked whether it was murder.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[228,1569,753,511]]]'>Carchia left the Dunkin Donuts shop, and defendant followed him outside. Houde stated that he had been in a fight earlier in the evening with a black male and expressed concern whether in the scuffle the man had been hurt or even fatally injured. Carchia responded that he had not heard anything about such an incident. Houde reentered the Dunkin Donuts shop, and Carchia radioed Sergeant Steven Hall, his superior officer.</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[225,2102,753,363]]]'>When Houde entered the shop, the night manager, James Silverthorn, asked Houde if he had heard what happened on the mall, referring to the body that had been discovered. Houde replied, “[A]re you kidding? I had a fight with a black guy over there tonight and I left a telephone cord around his neck.”</p>

One of them advised Houde of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Houde stated in response to their inquiry that he had had a fight on the mall near a telephone booth with a black male. Houde said that he had hit the man and wondered if he had hurt him. Houde stated that the man “got up and walked away” after the fight. Houde explained that he had been on the telephone attempting to contact his girlfriend when a black male about 35 to 40 years of age came up to him and asked him for money “to buy a drink.” Houde said that he refused to give the man money. In response to the refusal the man became belligerent and Houde got into a fist fight with him. Houde consented to go with Sergeant Hall in order to show him where the fight had taken place. As Hall drove down Westminster Mall, Houde pointed out the group of phones in front of 204 Westminster Mall where the victim was found. Houde told Hall that the fight had taken place at around 11 p.m. Shortly thereafter Houde was placed under arrest. He was later indicted for the murder of Robert Smith.</p>
    <p id="b398-9" data-blocks='[["BL_398.9",398,[1031,1360,749,370]]]'>At trial Dr. Kristin Sweeney, deputy chief medical examiner, testified that the cause of Smith’s death was asphyxia due to ligature strangulation. She stated that the sternocleidomastoid muscle (a large muscle on the side of the neck) was torn in two in the front portion and extensively bruised in the back portion.</p>
    <p id="b398-10" data-blocks='[["BL_398.10",398,[1028,1751,749,418]]]'>After deliberation the jury found defendant to be guilty of murder in the second degree. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, and on October 30, 1989, the trial justice sentenced Houde to forty years imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, of which twenty-five years were to be served and the remaining fifteen years suspended.</p>

In support of the motion to suppress, defendant’s attorney pointed out that the motivation for this request was that Houde’s girlfriend, Sheila Brown, had filed a complaint against defendant for assault. Although the parties ultimately stipulated before the jury that such a complaint had been filed by Brown against Houde on October 4, 1987, the trial justice denied the motion to suppress and allowed Officer Carchia to testify concerning this inquiry on the ground that it was relevant on the issue of defendant’s consciousness of guilt.</p>
    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[194,1028,754,1317]]]'>The defendant argues to us, as he did to the trial justice, that the existence of another plausible explanation for the inquiry reduced the probative force of this testimony to a level where its relevance was outweighed by its prejudice to defendant in requiring him by way of explanation to admit that he had been charged with another crime. In holding that the evidence was admissible, the trial justice was following Rules 402 and 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Rule 402 states generally that all relevant evidence is admissible. Relevant evidence has been defined as evidence that tends to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without such evidence. <em>Capezza v.

It is important to note that the trial justice did not consider this conversation between Officer Carchia and Houde in isolation. He considered this inquiry in combination with the telephone call made by Houde to Duffy and with the statement made by Houde to James Silverthorn, the manager of Dunkin Donuts.</p>

This evidence was clearly relevant on the issue of consciousness of guilt, particularly when viewed in combination with other statements made by defendant on the same evening. The existence of another possible explanation for Houde’s inquiry concerning a warrant should not have affected the admissibility of the evidence but might be considered by the jury in regard to its weight. The trial justice called the stipulation relating to the assault complaint to the attention of the jury and further cautioned the jurors that they were not to draw any unfavorable inferences against defendant as a result of the existence of this complaint. He properly allowed the jurors to assess the weight of this evidence in all the surrounding circumstances. In so doing, he acted well within the bounds of his discretion and committed no error.</p>

Rule 701 deals with opinion evidence offered by lay witnesses. A more appropriate rule regarding the admissibility of this testimony is Rule 901, which deals with the requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility. The rule states that this requirement is <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.

    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[217,693,754,836]]]'>In the case at bar Duffy testified that she had known defendant for approximately two years and had had conversations with him at the bar a few times each week during that period. Not only had she conversed with him relative to drink orders but she had bought jewelry from him. We are of the opinion that Duffy’s verbal contacts with defendant over this period established an adequate foundation for the judge to make a preliminary finding that her recognition of his voice was sufficient to satisfy Rule 901(b)(5). <em>See also State v.

The trial justice in the case at bar instructed the jury in accordance with our holding in <em>Caruolo </em>that the state was not required to prove motive as an element of the crime. This statement of the law was accurate. The argument that the trial justice misconceived the holding of <em>State v.

We must respectfully disagree because Corley was not asked his opinion in regard to Picard’s guilt or innocence. He simply characterized the posture in which he regarded Picard at the time of his taking a statement from him and photographing him. This does not implicate the elements that were present in our prior cases wherein we disapproved of the comment by a witness upon the credibility or lack of credibility of a witness. <em>State v.

The position of defendant is somewhat obscure on this issue because he argues, first, that he was in custody whereas the trial justice found as a fact that he was not. More significantly, the trial justice found by clear and convincing evidence that Houde had been given his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he voluntarily waived such rights. The only people present at the time of the conversation among Carchia, Hall, and defendant were those three individuals. Both Carchia and Hall stated that defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he voluntarily decided to make a statement after such admonition. We have often stated that a finding by a trial justice <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>relating to the giving of <em>Miranda </em>admonitions and their sufficiency will not be set aside or disturbed on review unless clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Amado, </em><a href="/a2d/424/1057-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="424 A.2d 1057" data-case-ids="7964520" data-case-paths="/a2d/424/1057-01">424 A.2d 1057</a>, 1062 (R.I.1981). The record in this case amply supports the finding by the trial justice that such admonitions were given prior to any statements having been made by defendant. Therefore, assuming without deciding that defendant may have been in custody from the, beginning of the interview, we conclude that the statements made would nevertheless have been admissible.</p>
    <p id="AGC" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[220,1003,753,934]]]'>The defendant argues that the sufficiency of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings would have been affected by the testimony of Detective Corley, who was summoned by defendant but was not available to testify. Since Corley was not present during the colloquy that took place outside the Dunkin Donuts shop, we are unable to determine how his testimony on this subject could have been relevant. It is obvious from the exchange between defense counsel and the trial justice that defense counsel had not even the glimmer of an idea concerning what Corley would have testified to if he were present in court. This omission cannot form any basis for faulting the trial justice or finding reversible error in his declining to continue the case to enable Detective Corley to be present.</p>
