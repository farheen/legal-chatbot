Notice of Ms. Irma McPherson’s death was timely given to the DCHA. The housing unit in which Ms. Irma McPherson had resided also was shared by Debra and Tiffany McPherson,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and other relatives, who continued to live there following Ms. Irma McPherson’s death. No new lease or lease agreement was executed by any of the remaining relatives and the DCHA.

Ms. McPherson’s May 2001 application was preliminarily denied due to her alleged past criminal activity. Two letters from the DCHA to Ms. McPherson informing her of administrative mechanisms of redress available to her went unacknowledged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Ms. McPherson claims she never received either communication.

Ms. McPherson claims she was alerted to this action by a summons posted on the property on January 17, 2002, noting that eviction proceedings had begun against Ms. Irma McPherson. A default judgment was ordered on January 29, 2002. On January 30, 2002, Ms. McPherson filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for leave to intervene and to vacate the default judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Her motion was denied “for want of prosecution.” Because her hospitalization for a kidney ailment had precluded her presence at a February 7, 2002, hearing on her motion, Ms. McPherson filed a motion for reconsideration on February 15, 2002, which was granted. A new hearing was scheduled for March 12, 2002, but on February 28, 2002, a writ of restitution was issued. However, Ms. McPherson successfully applied for a stay of the writ. Following a non-evidentiary hearing on March 19, 2002, the trial court denied Ms. McPherson’s motion to intervene.</p>

The record reflects no dispute about DCHA’s awareness of the continuing occupancy, and the yearly recertifications. Moreover, DOHA made no allegation that it was not receiving rental payments. Furthermore, eviction would oust Ms. McPherson from the housing unit, and allowing the underlying eviction action to occur without Ms. McPherson as a party impairs or impedes her ability to protect that interest.
