    <p id="b98-21" data-blocks='[["BL_98.21",98,[1017,1230,746,1040]]]'>On December 2, 1990, at approximately 4:35 a.m., the plaintiff Laura Dana, was arrested in Baileyville for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI). Approximately one hour and fifteen minute's later, Dana was again arrested for OUI in. Indian Township. On the date of her arrest, Dana had one prior conviction for OUI dating back to March 1989. On Dana’s guilty plea to two charges of OUI arising out of the December 1990 arrests, the Superior Court <em>(Sils-by, J.) </em>suspended her license for two one-year terms to run concurrently. Subsequently the Secretary of State administratively extended Dana’s suspension for one additional year. Pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 80C, Dana sought review of this decision by the Superior Court <em>(Alexander, J.) </em>which affirmed the decision of the Secretary of State. On Dana’s appeal, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

That question is answered in section 1312-B(2)(F), i.e., previous to “the date of the new conduct.” On the date of the new conduct Dana had only one previous conviction.</p>
    <p id="b99-10" data-blocks='[["BL_99.9",99,[159,1867,747,648]]]'>The Secretary of State concedes that “it is undisputed that prior to December 2, 1990, Dana had one prior OUI conviction within the prior six years” and thus that “the sentencing court was constrained by section 1312-B(2)(F) from imposing an enhanced license suspension on her.” He argues, however, that “no such constraint hinders the Secretary of State’s authority under 1312-D(1)” citing our decision in <em>Benedix v. Secretary of State, </em><a href="/a2d/603/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="603 A.2d 473" data-case-ids="7938816" data-case-paths="/a2d/603/0473-01">603 A.2d 473</a>, 475 (Me.1992), in support of his novel proposition.

Secretary of State </em>can be construed to give the Secretary the authority to impose a suspension greater than that mandated by section 1312-B. On the contrary, in <em>Benedix </em>we said that “section 1312-D(1) recognizes the Secretary’s back-up authority ... to enter the license suspension that according to the Secretary’s records is statutorily mandated by section 1312-B” and that “[s]ection 1312-D(l) ... requires the Secretary to enter the exact suspension that ... is required by the OUI statutes.” <em><a href="/a2d/603/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="603 A.2d 473" data-case-ids="7938816" data-case-paths="/a2d/603/0473-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/603/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="603 A.2d 473" data-case-ids="7938816" data-case-paths="/a2d/603/0473-01">at 474-75</a>.</p>
