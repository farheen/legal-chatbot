Thereafter, a telephone hearing was conducted before the Bureau’s Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”), Sharon Fox Zanotto, to determine whether JRSS was entitled to a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal. At the hearing, JRSS presented testimony from its office manager, who said that although she was authorized to accept service, she never received the audit report. JRSS further submitted the affidavit of Robert Sobanski, then a reimbursement analyst with JRSS’s law firm, Capozzi &amp; Associates. Sobanski represented in the affidavit that, in September 2004, JRSS’s Chief Financial Officer, Michael Callan, requested him to prepare projections for the facility’s medical assistance rates. In the process of preparing these projections, Sobanski noticed the 2002 audit results were missing from the files, and called Callan to determine their whereabouts. According to Sobanski, Cal-lan told him JRSS never received DPWs audit report for 2002. Sobanski then contacted DPW and requested a copy of the report, which he later obtained on October 27, 2004. JRSS did not contest Sobanski’s receipt of the report, but argued he was not authorized to accept service of the report on the facility’s behalf.</p>

She indicated that in accordance with the department’s practice and custom, the 2002 audit report would have been mailed out on March 31, 2004. She did not recall DPW experiencing any problems at the time with mailing any of the reports, and noted the report in question was never returned as undelivered. DPW also presented the testimony of its Chief Rate Analyst, Ian Cohen, who testified that the audit report was properly mailed on March 31, 2004, and that it was the department’s standard practice to stamp the mailing date on the notices the same day they were mailed. Cohen further testified that he personally provided a copy of the report to Sobanski on October 27, 2004, at which time Sobanski represented he was acting on JRSS’s behalf.</p>

ALJ Zanotto then noted that while JRSS offered testimony reflecting it did not receive the notice, testimony alone on this point was insufficient to rebut the presumption. As JRSS offered nothing more than testimony, the judge indicated she could not grant its motion to proceed <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>ALJ Zanotto further found that JRSS failed to act promptly after its agent (Sobanski) obtained a copy of the report on October 27, 2004. For these reasons, the judge concluded JRSS failed to demonstrate it was entitled to a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal, and recommended the appeal be dismissed.</p>

JRSS then filed a petition for reconsideration with the Secretary of DPW, who upheld the Bureau’s decision. JRSS appealed to the Commonwealth Court, arguing that while the notice of adjudication was stamped with the March 31, 2004 date, it was defective because it did not comply with DPWs Standing Practice Order (“SPO”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Rule 13 requiring the notice to <a id="p1188" href="#p1188" data-label="1188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1188</a>include the date the notice was deposited in the mail. JRSS also argued Sobanski was not an agent authorized to accept personal service on its behalf, and so personal service was not effectuated on JRSS when Sobanski was provided a copy of the audit report. JRSS did not, however, contest the Bureau’s determination that JRSS itself received a copy of the report, or otherwise challenge the Bureau’s conclusion that the facility was not entitled to an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>

The majority reasoned that “[wjhen an administrative agency makes service by mail, the date of mailing is required to be listed on the notice of adjudication because that date is ‘deemed to be the date of entry of the order ... ’ and the date from which the time for appeal begins to run.” <em>Julia Ribaudo Senior Serv. v.

The majority observed that a simple date stamp on the notice, as in this case, without any specific indication that it is the mailing date, is not sufficiently informative. Lastly, the majority rejected DPW’s claim that personal service of the audit report on Sobanski on October 27, 2004 began the running of the appeal period, noting that Sobanski was not JRSS’s agent authorized to accept personal service. Judge Smith-Ribner noted her dissent without writing an opinion. DPW sought allowance of appeal, and we granted allocatur on the following issues:</p>

We agreed with the taxpayer that the first notice was inadequate to trigger the appeal period, and found the appeal to be timely since the Department of Revenue’s failure to provide the requisite notice of the decision’s mailing date justified the taxpayer’s reliance on the date of the second notice of reassessment as the commencement of the period for appeal. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this decision, we rejected the contention that a postmark on an envelope carrying an agency decision could serve as the date of mailing.</p>

That assumes, however, that Section 1102(b)(1)(ii)(B) is ambiguous, which we conclude it is not, and note the parties do not contend otherwise. (Rather, their dispute largely concerns the interpretation of <em>Schmidt </em>and its progeny.) Regardless of the method of the provision of the notice, under Section 1102 the appeal period is triggered by the "date of the notice of the departmental action.” 67 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1102(b)(1)(ii)(A) &amp; (b)(1)(ii)(B). It is manifest to us that this is the "date” on the "notice” of the "departmental action."

However, “of’ simply does not unambiguously mean “on”; and notice does not always mean a written notice form. Indeed, the term “notice” is inherently ambiguous-it can mean actual notification in some form; receipt of a formal written notice; the condition of being notified whether or not actual awareness exists; or a written or printed announcement. <em>See </em>BlaCk’s Law Dictionary 1090 (8th ed.1999). Accordingly, scriveners of statutes, rules of court, and contracts frequently provide specific and sometimes extensive clarification concerning the form and effective date of required notices, particularly as they relate to time periods provided for required actions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa.R.A.P. 121(c), (e) (allowing for service of papers by mail and allowing an extra three days for response as compared to personal service).</p>

Rather, I find the statute to be poorly framed, in that it does not closely define the appeal period in terms of effective notice, or specifically eschew the concept of effective notice.

In this regard, I have difficulty envisioning that the Legislature would have so little regard for personal rights and interests that it would provide that any and all potential laxness in administrative procedures in the giving of notice should inure to the detriment of persons and entities affected by agency action. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (reflecting the presumption in statutory interpretation that the General Assembly does not intend results that are absurd or unreasonable).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Under the Department’s own practice, “notice” (i.e., notification) is different from a “written notice form” (since the Department is authorized to “give notice” through the act of mailing “a written notice”). Furthermore, the standing order reflects a recognition that the mere act of date-stamping a notice form does not furnish notice, but that notice is given by affirmative acts of convey-anee (mailing, service, or publication). The standing order wholly conforms to the perspective that the “date of the notice” is the date notification is given (or the effective date of the notice).</p>
    <p id="b1223-15" data-blocks='[["BL_1223.16",1223,[922,572,754,1075]]]'>Indeed, the Department’s parlance referencing the “giv[ingj” of notice mirrors the verbiage of Section 1102(b)(1)(ii)(B). <em>See </em>67 Pa.C.S. § 1102(b)(1)(ii)(B) (“[I]f notice <em>was given </em>by mail, [an appeal must be filed] within 33 days of the date of the notice of the departmental action.” (emphasis added)). At a very minimum, the tension between the Department’s own reasonable interpretation of the statute, as reflected in its standing practice order, and the majority’s construction militates strongly against the majority’s position that the statute unambiguously keys notice to a <em>pro forma </em>date stamp, regardless of the date of conveyance. Finally, the similarity between a notification-based reading of Section 1102(b)(1)(ii) and other conventional procedures for providing notice, <em>see, e.g., </em>Pa.R.A.P. 121(c), (e), seems too close to overlook.</p>

Since the Department specified in its letter that the appeal period commenced on the date of its notice, and the Department appears to apprehend that the date that notice is provided for purposes of Section 1102(b)(1)(ii)(B) is the date of mailing, I have no objection to presuming the Department mailed the notice on the date it was prepared, as it says it did. Nevertheless, consistent with the Commonwealth Court’s decision, I believe the law prevailing at the time of the agency’s notice was clear, and I cannot fault the intermediate appellate court for applying <em>Schmidt </em>in its decision in this case. Indeed, DPW appears to have recognized the prevailing requirements in its Standing Practice Order Rule 13, which requires notice of an agency action to contain the effective date of the action, the basis for the decision, and the date the notice was deposited in the mail or otherwise served on the provider. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=33%20Pa.%20Bull.%203053" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="33 Pa.
