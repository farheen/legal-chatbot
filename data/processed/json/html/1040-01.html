At his trial, four errors in translation during his testimony were detected by the Spanish-speaking prosecutor and defense counsel and corrective action was taken. Although no further action was sought by Ramirez, he now claims on appeal that the trial court committed reversible error by failing sua sponte to conduct a voir dire into the interpreter’s competence. Given the circumstances here, we disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>

According to the complainant, on February 8, 1999, she let Ramirez — whom she recognized as a maintenance worker in her building — into her apartment to perform maintenance work. After inspecting the pipes, Ramirez locked the complainant’s front door and asked her to go on a date with him. When the complainant refused, Ramirez began punching and shoving her, forcing her to the ground, and eventually to her bed. At one point during the struggle, the complainant grabbed a knife, which Ramirez wrested from her, injuring them both. Ramirez then attempted to rape the complainant, but could not maintain an erection. After several unsuccessful attempts at penetration, Ramirez washed the blood off himself in the complainant’s shower and took the bedding (which was stained with blood from the struggle) from the complainant’s bed. Ramirez instructed the complainant not to tell anyone what had happened, gave her $50.00 and left the apartment. The complainant then sought help from her neighbors, who contacted emergency services.</p>

According to Ramirez, he went to the complainant’s apartment on the day in question at her request, where they had consensual sex; however, he was only able to give her $50.00. The complainant was angered by the reduced payment and slapped Ramirez, who slapped her in return. This escalated to a violent exchange during which the complainant grabbed a kitchen knife, which Ramirez wrested from her, cutting them both. Both parties sustained injuries, and Ramirez left the apartment and cleaned up at home.</p>

He points out that the interpreter is an official appointed by the court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> and it should be particularly vigilant when possible deficiencies in such an official’s performance are brought to the court’s attention, just as would be the case for a court clerk or marshal. Ramirez analogizes the situation to that presented where possible deficiencies in defense counsel’s preparation are brought to the attention of the trial court pre-trial and we have mandated a duty on the trial court to engage in an immediate pre-trial determination of the adequacy of the preparation. <em>See Monroe v.

First, he asserts that the trial court limited cross-examination of the complainant about a vibrator, but the record reflects no such limitation once counsel promised in opening statement that appellant would testify on the subject. Second, he argues that the trial court erred in declining to admit as substantive evidence portions of transcripts from the first trial, in which the complainant testified regarding Ramirez’s truck. However, the record demonstrates that defense counsel thoroughly brought out the alleged inconsistencies, including reading the prior testimony verbatim, so that any error was harmless.</p>
