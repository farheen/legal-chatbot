The Court considers this to be the appropriate sanction upon the following considerations:</p>

In the first case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> this Court imposed the sanction of reprimand. In that case, Judge Le-adbetter dissented and would have imposed a sanction of suspension for “at least” ninety days without pay.</blockquote>

I do so because I believe that is a sanction too harsh in the circumstances of this case. While Respondent’s conduct was unquestionably rude, and even nasty, it was not criminal, and there was no implication made that his service to the citizens of his magisterial district was other than competent and conscientious. In my view, suspension for six months without pay would be an appropriate sanction.</p>
