He raises two issues on this appeal: 1) whether the court committed reversible error in refusing to consider marital misconduct as a factor in dividing the marital property and 2) whether the court abused its discretion in dividing the marital property approximately equally between the parties. The wife, plaintiff-appellee in this action, moves this Court for counsel fees and costs on appeal. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

A hearing was held, and the divorce was denied on February 1, 1977.</p>

By February of 1977, the wife had moved in with another man. On March 14, 1978, the wife filed this action for divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences. The husband answered by denying the allegations of irreconcilable differences and plaintiff’s faithfulness to her wedding vows, but he raised no affirmative defenses. A hearing was held, and the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the ground of irreconcilable differences.</p>

In addition, the wife was awarded a 1971 Camaro automobile and the household furniture then in her possession; the husband was awarded a 1978 Corvette automobile, the motorcycles, the tools then in his possession and the business known as “Limerick Mills Outlet.” All of these were awards of marital property. All other personal property, including savings and checking accounts, insurance policies and retirement funds, was awarded to the party then in possession. No alimony was awarded to either party.

Absent any legislative history to that effect, we find this conclusion unwarranted.

It is clear from the enumerated “relevant factors” in Section 722-A(l) that the primary emphasis is economic: present economic circumstances and past contributions to the marriage, either financial or translatable into financial terms, such as the contribution of a spouse as homemaker. At most, the Legislature may have hesitated to absolutely preclude the court from considering “marital misconduct” in the division of marital property when the “marital misconduct” was of a financial nature. <em>See Oppenheimer v. Oppenheimer, </em><a href="/ariz-app/22/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="22 Ariz.

This purpose would be wholly defeated if all the evidence relevant to a fault-based divorce action could be introduced on the issue of property distribution-a phase of the proceedings designed to approximate the distribution of assets on the dissolution of a business partnership. <em>Id. </em>at 93.

The husband is incorrect for two reasons: first, the relative economic positions of the parties is only one factor to be considered by the court in dividing the marital property; second, even if the wife were in fact in a superior economic position, this would not necessarily defeat the legislative policy favoring equal division of marital property on marriage dissolution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Superior Court plainly considered the economic circumstances of the parties at the time of the divorce in making its property distribution.

The record shows that over the course of the marriage the economic contributions of the parties, both of whom worked full time, were roughly $66,-000.00 by the wife and $78,000.00 by the husband. It was unrefuted that while the parties lived together the wife did all of the housework including such household upkeep as painting. The court found the parties’ contributions to the upkeep of the marital property had been approximately equal in light of the husband’s exclusive use of that property since the separation.
