This notification was provided in the presence of Grievant’s immediate superiors, the IAD investigator, and a representative from Appellant, the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge Number 5 (FOP). Consistent therewith, Grievant was terminated on December IB, 2002. The FOP, on behalf of Grievant, and pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the City and the FOP, appealed the termination to a neutral arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The FOP contended that the termination was without cause and thus viola-tive of the CBA.

The FOP submitted that, while prior practice had formerly been to request documents and the like informally through correspondence addressed to the City, the City had recently changed its stance regarding arbitration discovery, and was requiring subpoenas for all information. Despite the City’s change in position, the FOP contended that, in this case, as well as other Act 111 arbitrations between the parties, the City had continuously refused to comply with .formal discovery requests.</p>

The City further stated that there had been settlement negotiations in the weeks leading up to the July 10 hearing, and the FOP’s counsel made no mention of the failure to comply with the subpoena. Moreover, the City argued the FOP could have filed a motion to enforce' the subpoena with the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas prior to the hearing, rather than waiting, then asserting prejudice, and requesting the imposition of severe sanctions. The City then noted that neither the FOP nor Grievant had been prejudiced by the error given that the FOP received the documents two weeks before the July 25 merits hearing, <a id="p1265" href="#p1265" data-label="1265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1265</a>rather than on July 10, as it had originally requested.

While recognizing that the deputy City Solicitor was unaware of the subpoena until the July 10 hearing and that counsel diligently cured the problem immediately thereafter, the arbitrator found that the Grievant had sustained prejudice because he was seeking reinstatement to the police force and the delay in the proceedings had slowed this quest. Moreover and importantly, the arbitrator further faulted the City for alleged noncomplianee in other Act 111 arbitrations before different arbitrators and involving different attorneys from the City Solicitor’s office. The arbitrator did not find any bad faith on the City’s part specific to this case, but nevertheless stated that in his experience, the FOP has had significant compliance problems with the City in the past, and that the City should not be permitted to ignore subpoenas, regardless of its good or bad faith.

Moreover, the court noted that, while Grievant (and the FOP) sustained some prejudice, it had been cured when the City provided the requested documents immediately following the July 10 hearing, providing Grievant and FOP two weeks to study the documents and prepare for the hearing, when the FOP had only sought the documents on the day of the originally scheduled hearing. In the end, the Commonwealth Court found that the sanction of complete preclusion of evidence equating to a dismissal of the City’s case, was a violation of due process, and thus ordered the remand for a full arbitration hearing.</p>

To that end, the City contends that the arbitrator did not find any willful misconduct on its part. The City further strongly objects to the FOP’s and Grievant’s contention that they were prejudiced. As noted above, the City believes that by receiving the subpoenaed materials two weeks prior to the hearing, Grievant and FOP were, in fact, benefitted. Thus, the City contends it properly raised a due process question cognizable under narrow <em>certiorari, </em>and that there was, in fact, a violation of due process.

Initially, we note that there is no doubt that a discovery violation by the City occurred; the City concedes as much. As already established, the arbitrator issued a subpoena, and the City failed to produce the duly requested materials by the July 10 deadline for providing them. As a result of this noncompliance, the arbitrator found that the FOP and Grievant were prejudiced by the violation in two ways. First, the City prevented Grievant and the FOP from preparing their case for the July 10 arbitration hearing by failing to turn over the requested materials, reasoning that until the City turns over such evidence, it remains in exclusive control thereof. Moreover, the arbitrator concluded that Grievant and the FOP sustained prejudice due to the “substantial backlog of well over 200 grievances pending before arbitration. Therefore[,] to grant additional time in order to prepare and eventually reschedule a hearing would further prejudice [Grievant] by forcing him to encounter more ... delays in resolving this matter.” Arbitration Award Op. at 6.</p>

As discussed <em>supra, </em>the subpoena contained a compliance date of July 10 and, accordingly, the City could have fully complied with the subpoena by simply providing the requested items to the FOP in the moments prior to the commencement of the hearing. Upon being informed of its inadvertent noncompliance, the City immediately provided the requested documents to the FOP. With the hearing continued until July 25, the FOP had an additional two weeks to prepare its case. The FOP thus received more time to prepare its case than it would have received had the City provided the documents on the subpoena’s due date. The FOP’s second averment of prejudice is that Grievant’s ultimate return to this police officer position was delayed by the continuance. However, that continuance was two weeks, and obviously of no signifi-<a id="p1272" href="#p1272" data-label="1272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1272</a>canee in the scheme of this case.

On that point, while the FOP attempts on numerous occasions in its brief to characterize the City’s actions as “willful,” the arbitrator declined to make such a finding. Our independent review of the record fully supports the arbitrator’s conclusion that the City did not act willfully, or in bad faith, in failing to provide the requested discovery. Indeed, there is ample support for the arbitrator’s holding in this regard: the FOP conceded that the subpoena inadvertently “sat on a secretary’s desk,” N.T., Jul. 25, 2006, at 11, and that the noncompliance was the result of a “clerical error.” <em>Id. </em>at 28. Further, the deputy City Solicitor supplied the subpoenaed documents promptly upon being informed of the inadvertent noncompliance. Thus, we find no willful misconduct on the City’s part.</p>

There is no question that the evidence at issue was vitally important to both the City and the FOP. We further recognize the arbitrator’s finding that the FOP was hampered in the preparation of its case for the July 10 hearing because of the City’s noncompliance. Notwithstanding this, the City, which bore the burden of proving just cause for Grievant’s termination, clearly had no other alternative but to rest its case once the arbitrator precluded the entry of any evidence or testimony subject to the terms of the subpoena. While the FOP argues that the City had other options to present its case—namely calling the IAD investigator and Grievant—as already noted, this contention is contradicted by the very language of the subpoena and the sanction imposed by the arbitrator. <em>See supra </em>note 7. The subpoena requested all documents subject to the investigation; surely, the IAD investigator and Grievant would both have testified to matters covered by the subpoena and subsequent sanction. Thus, we conclude that the evidence that was excluded was critical to the City’s ability to present a case.</p>

To that end, the FOP contends that the City has violated discovery orders in other Act 111 cases, and we should draw upon such alleged misconduct to reinstate the sanctions imposed by the arbitrator instantly. Indeed, the arbitrator seemingly used these prior violations as a basis for his decision: “For quite some time there was a controversy which it was alleged that the City had failed to turn over customary documents and evidence. <em>As a result six prior arbitrators have at least expressed their displeasure or have ruled against the City.” </em>Arbitration Award Op. at 4 (emphasis added). The City counters, however, that such supposed noncompliance by it in other Act 111 arbitrations, involving different counsel, arbitrators, grievants, facts, and circumstances, has no relevance here.</p>

In particular, regarding the prongs of prejudice and willful misconduct, while the FOP and Griev-ant arguably suffered prejudice by the City’s failure to comply with the subpoena, we find of great import that such prejudice was sufficiently cured by the City’s subsequent actions and that no willful misconduct occurred on the part of the City. <em>See Stewart, </em><a href="/pa-super/452/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="681 A.2d 214" data-case-ids="769265,7859854" data-case-paths="/pa-super/452/0120-01,/a2d/681/0214-01">681 A.2d at 217</a>. Again, the FOP was afforded an additional two weeks to prepare for the arbitration once the subpoena was complied with, and the arbitrator, despite the FOP’s assertions to the contrary, did not find any willful misconduct or bad faith on the City’s part. Further, the excluded evidence consisted of the City’s entire case-in-chief, thus the arbitrator’s action constructively dismissed the grievance entirely. Finally, the City did not repeatedly violate discovery orders as they pertained to this arbitration. Rather, a sole transgression occurred, which the City immediately cured after recognizing the mistake. Accordingly, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that the City was improperly denied due process.</p>

Pursuant to the clear dictates and intent of Act 111, such discretionary sanction is a final, non-appealable determination of the arbitrator and not reviewable under our narrow <em>cer-tiorari </em>scope of review.</p>

The majority’s opinion reads as if it is justifying its power to conduct a review based on the fruits of that review. <em>See </em>op. at 1268. Although the majority correctly notes that appellate courts have a plenary standard of review when determining the applicability of the narrow <em>cer-tiorari </em>scope of review to Act 111 appeals, such plenary standard must nevertheless yield in deference to the arbitrator’s findings of fact. <em>See, e.g., Town of McCandless v.

Indeed, regarding the majority’s review as to whether the arbitrator appropriately imposed the sanction, the majority acts as if it were the “trial court.” The negative consequences of the majority’s approach here are potentially endless, and not just in the realm of Act 111 cases.</p>

Pennsylvania State Troopers’ Ass’n (Betancourt), </em><a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="540 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="472165" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01">540 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">656 A.2d 83</a>, 90 (1995) (“An error of law alone will not warrant reversal under the narrow <em>certio-rari </em>scope of review.”).

We would be faced with a different situation— one that certainly could have serious due process implications — if the arbitrator had precluded the City from presenting evidence unrelated to its failure to obey a subpoena, thereby in actuality depriving the City of an opportunity to present its remaining evidence. That is not this case. Thus, where the case on appeal establishes that a party before the Act 111 arbitrator fully had an opportunity for a hearing, but forfeited its opportunity through its own action, I conclude that the Act 111 arbitrator’s discretionary sanction ruling is beyond appellate review under the narrow <em>certiorari </em>scope of review.

Although it is undisputable that where appellate review is permitted, a severe sanction imposed under Rule 4019 should be given appropriate scrutiny, the majority here seems to signal that a trial judge’s discretion to impose severe and crippling sanctions will be subject to a new constitutional test. Most troubling, the majority justifies its position by citation to cases that have absolutely nothing to do with the procedural posture involved in this case, or in any case involving the discretionary application of Rule 4019 sanctions, but rather involve basic principles of due process where the opportunity for a hearing has been allegedly denied. The majority now runs the risk that its decision will be interpreted by the practicing bar and tribunals below to equate the forfeiture of an opportunity to a hearing with a deprivation of such opportunity in the first instance. In <em>Logan, <a href="/us/455/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="455 U.S. 422" data-case-ids="11305924" data-case-paths="/us/455/0422-01">supra,</a> </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a litigant’s due process rights were violated when his administrative hearing was terminated for reasons completely beyond his control.

I believe that the majority’s decision will thereby potentially cause havoc, as the majority has now effectively modified Pa.

This is an extraordinary leap. Indeed, the case relied upon by the majority for such “proposition” simply provides that due process claims “are best reviewed as errors of law,” and, hence, are reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>Pocono Manor Investors, L.P. v.

Aside from the circumstance that the majority ignores this law, the majority also appears to disregard the fact that the impact of the delay was not on the FOP lawyers but on the police officer who was then out of a job. The arbitrator did not abuse his discretion by concluding that the grievant suffered some prejudice in this instance, particularly when the officer had already been out of a job for some years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> The majority’s conclusion of lack of prejudice is simply an impermissible substitution of its judgment for that of the arbitrator.

This “finding” of the majority is based on its reading of the record, which it believes shows that the FOP “conceded” that the City’s failure to honor the subpoena was inadvertent. <em>Id. </em>In my opinion, the record cited by the majority simply reflects that the FOP, without making any concession, understood that the City’s position was that its failure to honor the subpoena was a “clerical error.” <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 7/25/06, at 11 and 28. However, the fact that the FOP had strenuously argued below that the City has demonstrated a disturbing pattern of failing to respond to FOP discovery requests in order to delay and derail the arbitration of grievances indicates to me that the FOP was not “conceding” that the City’s failure to respond to the subpoena was innocent. More importantly, the arbitrator did not find that the FOP had made this concession, and it is beyond our standard of review to characterize the evidence to our liking. Further, although the arbitrator did not find that the City had acted in bad faith in this particular grievance arbitration matter, the arbitrator did determine that in his experience, the FOP has had significant compliance problems with the City in the past, and, thus, the City should simply no longer be permitted to ignore subpoenas.

Although there was no specific evidence of the City’s “bad intent” with respect to the subpoena in this particular grievance, as all such evidence was solely within the City’s possession, the arbitrator could, without making a specific finding of “bad intent” regarding the instant subpoena, nevertheless view the City’s behavior with suspicion because of the arbitrator’s knowledge of the City’s past behavior. Again, an appellate court’s job is not to review the record anew to arrive at an independent judgment, but to review the record to determine whether there are reasonable grounds for the discretionary rulings at issue.</p>
    <p id="b1306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1306.4",1306,[207,1179,753,1219]]]'>The majority then continues its fact-finding by determining that the arbitrator’s sanction precluded the City from presenting any evidence, despite the absolute absence of such factual finding by the arbitrator, and despite the FOP’s actual concession that the City could have called the IAD investigator and the grievant himself to testify. Again, the majority apparently believes the FOP is being disingenuous and that it would have actually opposed the City had it attempted to call these witnesses. It is not this Court’s job on appeal to make such a “finding” or leap to such conclusions. If the FOP were being disingenuous, the opportunity to show this was foreclosed by the City’s refusing to proceed with the hearing, opting instead for an appeal. Under the “significantly deferential” standard of appellate review that we must apply, the majority’s failure to consider the consequences of the City’s refusal to proceed is, I believe, troubling at best.</p>

Once again, I must register my distress that the majority deems it appropriate to act as “trial court.” The General Assembly did not intend that Act 111 arbitrators be so dismissed as insignificant trifles by appellate courts. Indeed, Act 111 grants rather extraordinary powers to its arbitrators, albeit within the narrow confines of their jurisdiction. Section 7 of Act 111, for example, not only provides that the Act 111 arbitrator’s decision is “final” and “non-appealable,” but it also provides that the final arbitrator’s award serves as a mandate to the public employer to enact required legislation or take such other action as is necessary to implement the award in a time-specific fashion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> 43 P.S. § 217.7; <em>see also Township of Moon v.

To my knowledge, no other tribunal in this Commonwealth has such vast power. More importantly, Act 111 makes the arbitrator the effective trial court whose decisions are intended not to be reviewable except under the narrowest of circumstances. If justifiably under the narrow <em>certiorari </em>scope of review, we have the extremely rare occasion to review an Act 111 arbitrator’s evidentiary rulings, then I believe we must accord the arbitrator at least the same level of deference as we would any trial judge, and probably greater deference. <em>See McCandless, supra </em>at 1000.</p>

Here, the majority simply dismisses the institutional and actual knowledge of the arbitrator concerning the City’s past transgressions, not to mention the arbitrator’s apparent finding that “six prior arbitrators have at least expressed their displeasure or have ruled against the City.” Arbitration Opinion at 4. We would not dismiss the institutional knowledge or findings of any other trial court in this manner. Where there is evidence and institutional knowledge that one party in a narrow series of cases involving only one other party, and related by subject matter, has, for years, behaved improperly in discovery matters, it is simply beyond my comprehension that the majority would dismiss such evidence and knowledge as irrelevant. Among other things, in taking this position, the majority glosses over the City’s apparent transgressions and thereby simply encourages the City to disregard discovery requests and abuse the system until stopped in some manner by a future case.

However, it is as yet unexplored whether the arbitrator’s power to compel the enactment of legislation or the promulgation of regulations involves only interest as opposed to grievance arbitration.

The majority suggests that the FOP file a separate grievance and arbitrate the matter in order to place the City "on notice.” I strongly urge this Court to take the position that, by this decision, the City is now "on notice" that its past behavior in grievance arbitrations shall be at issue when there is any future failure to honor discovery requests by the FOP in Act 111 grievance arbitrations.</p>
