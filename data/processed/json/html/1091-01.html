In 1989, appellant instituted the first action against Pension Mortgage Associates, Inc., Francis J. Regan, Jr., and Jeffrey Williams. In 1992, appellant instituted the second action against Mr. Re-gan, Mr. Williams, Williams Financial Group, Robert G. Welch, Esquire, Robert G. Welch, P.C., and Intrepid I Services, Inc., i/a Intrepid I. The defendants collectively are the appellees. Both actions concern the fact that appellees allegedly advised appellant to invest the Plan assets in investment vehicles which suffered losses.</p>

Since January, 1986, the individual defendants have been employed to administer the Plan, have been employed as investment fund managers, and have directed fund investments. In 1989, the individual defendants recommended that Plan assets be placed in a real estate mortgage which they said would be financially safe. The mortgage was to yield an annual return of eleven percent and was secured with 118 acres of real estate in New Jersey. The defendants prepared a mortgage participation agreement for the transaction, and appellant liquidated Plan assets to invest $162,026.68 in the mortgage investment vehicle. The individual defendants received a finder’s fee for the investment, and in addition, the corporate defendant, in which the two individual defendants own a controlling interest, received interest income on the mortgage principal. Appellant alleges in the complaint that he received only two interest payments from this venture and has not received any return of his principal.</p>

In addition, Mr. Welch was hired to assist in the administration of the Plan and investment of Plan assets. The individual defendants collusively induced appellant to execute certain investment contracts and transfer $644,030.58 from the Plan to investments in nine entities, including Intrepid I Services, Inc. Appellant never was told that Mr. Williams and Mr. Welch were officers, directors, and controlling shareholders in that corporation.

Super. 449" data-case-ids="911146" data-case-paths="/pa-super/415/0449-01">609 A.2d 837</a> (1992) (where appellant presented a position without elaboration or citation to ease law, we declined to address phantom argument).</p>
    <p id="b1153-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1153.8",1153,[967,325,751,1124]]]'>Appellant raises arguments that are not relevant and then conclusorily presents the only pertinent argument, ignoring the correct legal standards. We note the following with respect to his argument that the motions were improperly treated as motions to dismiss. The allegations are not in dispute; we can accept fully all the allegations contained in the complaints about appellees’ fraudulent acts. That is not the issue in this appeal. However the complaint is viewed and whether the motions are treated as ones to dismiss, as ones for judgment <em>on </em>the pleadings, or as ones for summary judgment, appellant cannot ignore the substantive issue herein. That issue is whether these cases are pre-empted and whether these actions are subject to the mandatory federal jurisdictional provisions of ERISA. The complaints here “relate to” a pension plan subject to the provisions of ERISA; the actions were not instituted by plan beneficiaries. Appellant’s arguments do not refute this conclusion; the trial court will be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b1153-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1153.9",1153,[964,1479,752,705]]]'>Appellant’s related argument is that if the record is viewed in the light most favorable to him, ERISA does not pre-empt the actions for the following reasons. Appellant alleged in his complaints that the individual defendants were fiduciaries within the meaning of ERISA. Those defendants denied that they were fiduciaries. Then, after appellees moved to dismiss the actions based on ERISA, appellant elected to argue that they were fiduciaries. Appellant argues that since the record viewed in the light most favorable to him establishes that the defendants are not fiduciaries under ERISA, ERISA does not apply.</p>
    <p id="b1153-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1153.10",1153,[964,2206,748,513]],["BL_1154.1",1154,[235,222,751,132]]]'>Again, appellant misapprehends the law. This Plan is an employee benefit pension plan within the meaning of ERISA. This is true whether or not appellees are fiduciaries with respect to the Plan. ERISA, as interpreted by the previously-cited law, has made the regulation of pension plans exclusively a federal concern. ERISA expresses Congressional desire that all plans subject to its provisions be subject to uniform rules and that people who deal with ERISA plans be <a id="p1096" href="#p1096" data-label="1096" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1096</a>subject to consistent liability. <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra; Goldberg v. Caplan, <a href="/pa-super/277/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="277 Pa. Super. 47" data-case-ids="144274" data-case-paths="/pa-super/277/0047-01">supra.</a></em>
    </p>
    <p id="b1154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1154.4",1154,[235,393,750,650]]]'>Thus, whether the defendants are fiduciaries must be determined by federal courts under uniform federal law. Whether appel-lees are subject to liability for their actions as those actions impact on this ERISA-cov-ered plan, as clearly provided in ERISA, must be analyzed in a federal court according to uniform federally-developed law. Whether an individual’s actions render him a fiduciary is to be subject to uniform interpretation and not vary according the state where the plan was created. Fiduciaries are not to be subject to conflicting liability under various state laws.</p>
    <p id="b1154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1154.5",1154,[230,1089,752,421]]]'>We next address appellant’s claim that the trial court was without jurisdiction to decide the matter because the motions to dismiss were filed with it rather than with the pro-thonotary. There is no case holding that a trial court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a motion handed to it. Appellant has confused a jurisdictional argument with a waiver argument.</p>
    <p id="b1154-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1154.6",1154,[230,1569,751,467]]]'>Our law is that if appellate resolution of an issue is <em>dependent upon </em>materials not provided in the record, it is deemed waived. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Muntz, </em><a href="/pa-super/428/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="428 Pa.

Super. 99" data-case-ids="933149" data-case-paths="/pa-super/428/0099-01">630 A.2d 51</a> (1993). In this case, however, appellees’ motions to dismiss are not necessary for us to resolve the issue. Our disposition of whether these actions are pre-empted requires only an examination of the complaints and reference to relevant law.</p>
    <p id="b1154-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1154.7",1154,[229,2095,751,364]]]'>As a practical matter, if we would reverse on this procedural ground, the only result would be a waste of judicial resources. The motions merely would be re-filed, the cases dismissed again, the appeals filed again, and briefs ordered again. This follows because subject-matter-jurisdiction issues cannot be waived.</p>
    <p id="b1154-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1154.10",1154,[1035,222,746,314]]]'>Thus, appellant cannot avoid the fact that his entitlement to relief requires that he address the substantive issues presented herein.
