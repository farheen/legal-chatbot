In determining the “balance due” under a contract to a general contractor who defaults prior to completion, we must decide whether it is proper to offset or deduct the cost of completion and liquidated damages for delay in completion. Our holding that the cost of completion may be deducted, while liquidated damages for delay may not, follows from both the words of the Statute and our conclusion that § 2707 modified, rather than repealed, the pre-existing Delaware Mechanic’s Lien Law.</p>

Prior to completion, Reid and Lloyd defaulted and were discharged, having already received $37,200 from the Browns. The Browns completed construction for an additional $3,912.97. Therefore, the total cash cost to the Browns was $41,-112.97, rather than the contract price of $45,027.17.

However, because § 2707 is part of the larger mechanic’s lien statutory scheme, it must be interpreted in a way consistent with the general purpose of that scheme, which is to protect suppliers of labor and material. We must uphold both purposes in our interpretation because, contrary to the Browns’ contentions, the General Assembly did not repeal the existing Mechanic’s Lien Law and adopt the New York System when it passed § 2707. Instead, the General Assembly sought to modify the existing Law to eliminate the harsh results that occurred under it. With these principles before us, we turn to the specific questions presented in this case.</p>

    <p id="b168-14" data-blocks='[["BL_168.9",168,[1012,855,744,224]]]'>The first issue is whether the amount expended by the Browns to complete their house may be set-off in determining “the extent of the balance due such contractor” under § 2707.</p>
    <p id="b168-15" data-blocks='[["BL_168.10",168,[1007,1105,749,989]]]'>The argument of the subcontractors, that when the Browns paid others to complete the house they were making bad faith payments to themselves, tortures the meaning and structure of the Statute and therefore must be rejected. The “payments” that § 2707 focuses upon for the “good faith” requirement are those made to the general contractor. It is explicitly stated in § 2707 that “[pjayments made to the contractor by the owner after service of process, as provided in § 2715 of this title,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> shall not be deemed to be ‘in good faith’.” Clearly, the purpose of the “good faith” requirement is to prevent an owner from attempting to defeat a supplier’s lien through payments to the general contractor. Thus, where an owner pays a general contractor after service of process under § 2715, such bad faith payments will not operate to reduce the fund to which a supplier’s lien may attach.</p>

If the homeowners were allowed to deduct liquidated damages for delay, there would be an offset of $6,350 (254 days times $25 per day) which, if added to the $41,112.97 (the amount paid to the general contractor plus the cost of completion), would leave no balance due to the contractor reachable by the lienholders. Although the Browns had expected to pay $45,027.17 for their house, an offset for delay would allow them to have their house for the sum of $41,112.97, at the expense of the lienholders.
