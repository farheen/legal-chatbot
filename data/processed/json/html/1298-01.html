On August 19, 1986, the Theberges transferred to the Worden Group the seven properties for a total of $900,000 and the Worden Group executed a promissory note payable to the Theberges for $180,000 secured by a mortgage on the property.</p>

To finance the purchase of the seven buildings, Horton Street (1) executed a promissory note to Casco Northern Bank in the amount of $720,000 secured by a first mortgage on the premises;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> (2) assumed the $180,000 promissory note to the Theberges, secured by a second mortgage on the premises; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> (3) executed a promissory note to Casco Northern for $120,000, secured by a third mortgage on the premises, with Albert as comaker; and (4) executed a $20,000 note payable to the Worden Group with Albert as comaker.</p>

To compensate for these losses, Albert loaned money to Darbro which in turn loaned the money to Horton Street. Darbro loaned additional monies to Horton Street.</p>

Albert also advised the Theberges that he could not make any further payments and that he wished to negotiate “a solution.” Although Albert met with the Theberges, the Worden Group and a representative from Casco Northern, the group, collectively, was unable to reach a resolution. Casco Northern thereafter sent a letter to Horton Street demanding payment of the $682,049.47 then due on the promissory note secured by the first mortgage, together with demands to <a id="p1300" href="#p1300" data-label="1300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1300</a>Darbro and Albert for $450,000 and $330,000, the respective amount each had guaranteed. Pursuant to the terms of an agreement dated November 17, 1989, Casco Northern agreed to loan Darbro $700,000 secured by mortgages on Albert’s real property, and the assignment by Albert of a $200,000 certificate of' deposit, 1000 shares of Coca-Cola common stock, and his municipal bonds. Casco Northern assigned to Albert, or his nominee, the existing Horton Street promissory note and mortgage on the condition that foreclosure proceedings on that mortgage be commenced within 30 days of the assignment. Pursuant to this agreement, Albert assigned the promissory note and mortgage to Darbro which instituted foreclosure proceedings resulting in the sale of the remaining five buildings at public auction for $320,000. The Theberge second mortgage was, accordingly, extinguished.</p>

The execution of that judgment was stayed pending the outcome of the present litigation.</p>
    <p id="b1356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1356.5",1356,[193,1667,757,948]]]'>In September 1991, the Theberges and the Worden Group instituted the present action against Darbro, Inc., Albert Small and Mitchell Small, seeking a judgment obligating them to pay the Worden Group any amounts they were obligated to pay the The-berges by reason of a default on the August 19, 1986, promissory note. By their complaint, the plaintiffs allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) Horton Street is the alter ego of Darbro, Albert and Mitchell; (2) the sale to Horton Street was based on representations made to the Worden Group that Albert would “stand behind” the Theberge mortgage; and (3) the defendants manipulated the application of the proceeds from the sale of the two buddings prior to the foreclosure sale of the remaining five buildings in an effort to obtain release of their personal guarantees and to avoid liability on the Theberge mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b1356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1356.6",1356,[997,210,754,1277]]]'>Following a five-day trial and consideration of the parties’ post-trial briefs, the court specifically found that the Theberges and the Worden Group had faded to establish that the defendants acted illegally or fraudulently and also found that none of the defendants had guaranteed the payment of the Theberge promissory note. The court further found that the Theberges and the Wor-den Group were sophisticated real estate investors in the Lewiston/Auburn area market in 1986 and understood the formalities, and the effect, of a personal guarantee in a real estate transaction. The court also found that Horton Street had no separate offices, utilities or employees; maintained no corporate records or books; co-mingled its business with that of the other defendants; and failed to conduct formal corporate meetings. Both Horton Street and Darbro were, in essence, Albert, as evidenced by the fact that, when in a financial crisis, Albert “unilaterally assumed full control of Horton Street on his own initiative” and acted to the defendants’ own benefit and to the detriment of the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b1356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1356.7",1356,[997,1531,751,879]]]'>Based on these findings, the court concluded that “notions of equitable estoppel ought to preclude” the defendants from asserting Horton Street’s corporate status as a defense and that the defendants were liable to the plaintiffs for the outstanding balance on the Theberge promissory note. Following further submissions by the parties, the court determined that (1) by the terms of the Theberge promissory note, the Theberges, as holders of the note, are entitled to attorney fees;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> (2) because the Worden Group is not a holder, they are not entitled to attorney fees; and (3) the total amount due the Theberges from the defendants is $253,764.13.

We disagree. The court found, and the record supports, that the defendants did not act illegally or fraudulently, but, rather conducted themselves “shrewdly” and employed “sharp business practices.” The court determined that the defendants did not formally, personally guarantee the transaction and that the plaintiffs were sophisticated real estate professionals who understood the significance of a personal guarantee. Indeed, the success of the Worden Group in securing Albert’s personal liability on the $20,000 note to them belies the contention of a reasonable expectation that Albert would “stand behind” the Theberge mortgage in the absence of a formal guarantee.</p>

    <p id="b1358-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1358.10",1358,[999,291,755,1028]]]'>I respectfully dissent. The trial court found that “Horton Street had no real substance as an independent entity.” The record amply supports this finding. Horton Street had no offices, employees, or utilities. It kept no corporate records and had no general ledger, journal, or minutes. It did not comply with the most basic corporate formalities. It had no corporate bylaws or board of directors. It commingled funds with Albert Small’s other corporate entities and failed to maintain arm’s length transactions between these related entities. It appeared to be undercapitalized, relying on Darbro and Albert Small to keep it afloat via undocumented infusions of cash and the direct payment of its corporate debts. It operated as a mere shell for the business dealings of Albert Small, with Small acting unilaterally through the corporation to further his own personal objectives.</p>
    <p id="b1358-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1358.11",1358,[1038,1362,569,37]]]'>The court also found the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b1358-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1358.12",1358,[1034,1433,716,866]]]'>At the time of the sale from the Worden Group to Horton Street representations were made to both the Worden Group and the Theberges that Albert Small was a person of financial substance and he would stand behind these transactions. While he did not formally, personally guarantee the transaction, and the plaintiffs were sophisticated enough to understand the formalities, nevertheless, he (or his agent, Mr. Garthwaite) certainly created the impression that the plaintiffs could count on Mr. Small. When the financial crisis arose, Albert Small ignored the independence of Horton Street and shrewdly arranged a transaction with Casco Bank which was to his benefit and to the detriment of plaintiffs.</blockquote>

During negotiations for the sale of his properties, the corporation’s agent repeatedly misrepresented that Horton Street was a partnership and he reassured the plaintiffs that Albert Small was wealthy and would stand behind the deal. Given the applicable law, these misrepresentations about the <a id="p1303" href="#p1303" data-label="1303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1303</a>readiness of Small to pay corporate debt from his personal wealth were appropriately critical to the court in its decision to disregard the limited liability of shareholders and pierce the corporate veil.</p>

ZimpRitch, Maine CORPORATION Law &amp; PRACTICE § 4.5 at 65 (1993) (“A principal purpose in most incorporations is to obtain limited shareholder liability ...”). Those doing business with a corporation, forewarned that they may look only to the corporation’s income and assets for security, routinely seek to reallocate a portion of this risk to the corporation by, <em>inter alia, </em>lessening the amount loaned, increasing the interest rate charged, or requiring that additional collateral be pledged.

Rev. 499">43 U.Chi.L.Rev. 499</a>, 520-22 (1973). Because of the “contract” creditors’ ability to assess and compensate for this risk, the Court adopts the position suggested by some commentators that “contract” creditors seeking to pierce the corporate veil should face a more stringent standard of proof than tort claimants who did not choose to deal with the corporate enterprise that was ultimately unable to pay its obligations. <em>See, e.g., </em>FletchER Cyc Cokp § 41.85 (Perm.Ed.1990) (“Courts apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in contract cases than they do in tort cases”); Frank H.

The court concluded that this conduct was inequitable: “Having totally disregarded Horton Street’s integrity as an independent entity, it would be unjust and inequitable to permit him [Albert Small] now to raise Horton Street’s corporate status as a defense to the Plaintiffs’ claims.” That judgment is amply supported by the evidence.

Barber, <em>Piercing the Corporate Veil, </em>17 Williamette L.Rev. 371, 385-86 (1981) (stating that courts mechanically apply same test to both tort and contract claims). In fact, a recent nationwide empirical study analyzing about 2000 piercing cases and their judicial outcomes contradicts the conventional wisdom that courts wiE be more likely to pierce the corporate veE in tort cases. The study found that courts disregard a corporation’s identity more often in the contract context than in the tort context. Robert B.
