The government argues that appellant waived this argument by stipulating at trial that he is required to register under SORA and by failing to seek judicial review of his sex-offender designation within the time described in section 5 of SORA (D.C.Code § 22-4004). As to the merits of appellant’s claim, the government contends that appellant’s post-SORA conviction of driving without a permit did render him subject to the SORA registration requirements. We are unpersuaded by the government’s waiver arguments, but we agree that appellant’s post-SORA conviction brought him within the reach of the Act, and we therefore affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>

D.C.Code §§ 22-4001(9), 22-4007, 22-4014 (2001). “Registration offenses” are those offenses described in D.C.Code § 22-4001(8)(D) (2001), including “[a]ny offense under the District of Columbia Official Code that involved ... assaulting or threatening another with the intent to ... commit rape.” <em>Id. </em>SORA defines “in custody or under supervision” as being “incarcerated ... on probation, on parole, [or] on supervised release,” “because of ...

We reject this argument because, unlike a guilty plea, a stipulated trial preserves a defendant’s right to appeal and preserves a claim that the trial court erred in denying a pre-trial motion. <em>See Graves v.

Here, after the trial court denied appellant’s motion to dismiss and appellant’s counsel objected to the ruling, the court stated specifically that “the issue is preserved.” And, after the parties informed the trial court that they had entered into a stipulated trial agreement, the trial court specifically informed appellant that by entering into a stipulated trial, he gave up his right to a full trial, but preserved his right to appeal from the denial of the motion in which he sought dismissal on the ground that he is not a “sex offender.” Further, when the trial court found appellant guilty of failure to <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>register, appellant’s trial counsel stated that appellant would “appeal[ ] whether or not he is a sex offender ... which is one of the facts [the parties had] just stipulated.” These statements made clear that appellant did not intend to waive his argument that he was not required to register.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Because this is an issue as to the reach of SORA, our review is <em>de novo. See, e.g., Mitchell v.

The Judiciary Committee explained that “a person who had merged into the general population — because he had finished serving his sentence for a registration offense before the enactment of this act — would generally not be required to register. But if that person later returned to D.C. custody or supervision because of conviction of another crime, he would become subject to the act’s registration provisions.” <em>Judiciary Committee Report </em>22. In this example, the Committee referred to “another crime” without limiting the triggering offense to <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>crimes of a sexual nature, violent crimes, or any other category of crimes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Moreover, as we recognized in <em>Doe, </em>the Council contemplated that the terms of the Act “would be given a broad construction to effectuate the goals of the legislation.” 855 A.2d at 1105 (explaining also that SORA is a “remedial regulatory enactment” that “should be liberally construed for the benefit of the class it is intended to protect,” <em>id. </em>at 1102 (citations omitted)).

The Report lists three other situations in which recourse to the section 22-4004(a) dispute-resolution process is authorized: "where a person contends that an offense he committed under the law of another jurisdiction is not equivalent or substantially similar to a District of Columbia registration offense,” “where the exceptions ... for consensual adult conduct and misdemeanor offenses involving undercover law enforcement officers are asserted,” and "where a person contends that the records establishing his commission of the pertinent offense or offenses are erroneous.” <em>Judiciary Committee Report </em>24. Resolution of each of these types of contentions (none of which is involved here) involves at least some factual inquiry. <em>Cf.

Testimony by a representative of the United States Attorney's Office, which worked with the D.C. Council to develop SORA, also underscores the Act's intended broad reach. The representative testified before the Judiciary Committee that, in order to protect the community adequately, "[SORA provisions] must cover as many offenders as possible” and must apply more than just prospectively. To that end, the definition of "sex offender” requires "registration of <em>any </em>sex offender who returns to the criminal justice system ... by being convicted of <em>any </em>offense, if he would have had to register had the law been in effect at the time of his earlier conviction for a sex offense.” <em>District of Columbia Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999: Hearings on Bill 13-350 Before the Committee on the Judiciary of the Council of the District of Columbia, </em>4 (1999) (testimony of Assistant United States Attorney, Patricia A.
