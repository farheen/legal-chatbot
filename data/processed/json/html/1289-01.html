    <p id="b1367-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1367.9",1367,[183,1412,754,897]]]'>I join with the majority in holding that there is nothing in the Police Pension Fund Act (Act 600), Act of May 29, 1956, P.L. (1955) 1804, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 771, that would foreclose an arbitrator in an Act 111 arbitration from awarding increased pension contributions. I write separately to point out that the operative fact in <em>Palyok v. Borough of West Mifflin, </em><a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">526 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">586 A.2d 366</a> (1991), was that the Borough had been requiring contributions based on all compensation paid to police, not just based on wages. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Palyok, </em>“[t]o permit the Borough to require contributions from the overtime and extra work compensation while denying the advantage of the additional compensation in the benefit formula would be inconsistent and inequitable.” <a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">526 Pa. at 328</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">586 A.2d at 368</a>.</p>
