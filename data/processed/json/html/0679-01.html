    <p id="b744-5" data-blocks='[["BL_744.5",744,[214,469,749,563]]]'>This is an action for misrepresentation in connection with a land sale. The parties to the sale were Howard W.

DeVore, his wife.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The real estate agents involved were Glenn A. Sizemore, Leon R.

    <p id="b744-8" data-blocks='[["BL_744.8",744,[214,1399,748,514]]]'>The DeVores wanted to sell a house and land which they owned near Seaford and they authorized Sizemore &amp; Ellis to be their agent in arranging for a sale of the property. In May 1975, the Moores and the De-Vores entered into a contract for the purchase and sale of the property. The contract did not refer to the size of the tract, but to a description of the land filed with the Recorder of Deeds. The sale was closed on July 21, 1975.</p>
    <p id="b744-9" data-blocks='[["BL_744.9",744,[215,1936,748,411]]]'>The amount of acreage was an important factor in plaintiffs’ decision to buy the De-Vores’ property, and they say that defendants falsely represented to them that the land consisted of three acres; plaintiffs say that such misrepresentations were made with intent to deceive and defraud them, and that they relied upon the misrepresented facts.</p>

Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and a Superior Court Judge granted the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty count, but denied it as to the remainder of the complaint. The Judge left open the possibility of a motion for summary judgment and, thereafter, defendants filed such a motion, supporting it with an affidavit by Sizemore. Plaintiffs then filed a motion to amend the complaint to add allegations of deceptive trade practices in violation of 6 <em>Del.C. </em>§§ 2532, 2533.</p>

    <p id="b745-8" data-blocks='[["BL_745.8",745,[169,1960,746,274]]]'>On its face, the affidavit does not controvert the issues of fraud and deceit alleged in the complaint, except that it states that Sizemore and Ellis relied on representations made to them by the DeVores with respect to the acreage.</p>

Indeed, the Sizemore affidavit conceded that the property was advertised as containing three acres, but says that was done “in good faith reliance on representations made to the Sizemore &amp; Ellis Realty Company by the aforementioned DeVores.” On this state of affairs, defendants did not support the motion for summary judgment as to allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, reliance and actual acreage. Thus the burden did not shift to plaintiffs to show that there were material issues of fact as to such issues. <em>Hurtt v.

    <p id="b745-11" data-blocks='[["BL_745.11",745,[963,650,748,704]]]'>Defendants did, however, propose a legal issue by filing the Sizemore affidavit, alleging good faith reliance on the representations by the principals (that is, the owners). But the Superior Court opinions do not discuss that issue nor do the briefs filed in this Court. In this Court, the briefs filed by the parties deal largely with procedural issues — whether a defendant is required to file an answer before moving for summary judgment, whether a motion for summary judgment was permissible after the Court had denied a motion to dismiss the complaint, whether counter-affidavits were required, and so on.</p>
    <p id="b745-12" data-blocks='[["BL_745.12",745,[964,1381,751,800]]]'>We recognize that an agent who makes untrue statements based upon information-received from the principal may not be liable because the principal knew that the information was untrue. See Restatement of the Law, <em>Agency </em>2d § 348, comment b; <em>Anno.: Misrepresentation </em>— Area <em>of Realty, </em><a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.L.R.%202d%20660" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="54 A.L.R. 2d 660">54 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>660</a>. But the Superior Court did not consider that law nor have the parties argued it here. Thus, it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that defendants are entitled to judgment. It follows that the case was not ready for summary judgment, and the Trial Judge erred when he granted it. See 6 (Part 2) <em>Moore’s Federal Practice </em>¶ 56.23 (1979). We do not reach other issues raised by the parties.</p>
