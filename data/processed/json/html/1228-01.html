Claude contends that the trial court’s interest calculation is supported by insufficient evidence and based on errors of law.

In June 1990, Corinne filed a motion seeking ar-rearages due from Claude. By its order of May 21, 1991, the trial court entered a judgment granting Corinne’s motion for ar-rearages in the amount of $11,195.38 plus interest in accordance with statute. Claude partially satisfied the judgment by paying Corinne for the arrearages, but because the parties could not agree, Corinne filed a motion seeking the court’s determination of the amount of interest due. On May 13, 1992, the trial court granted Corinne’s motion for interest in the amount of $35,392. In response to Claude’s motion to amend the May 13 judgment, contending that the amount of interest had been improperly determined, the trial court issued an order directing Corinne to submit a recalculation of the interest owed by Claude. On October 9, 1992, the trial court entered a judgment providing that Corinne was entitled to $28,739 in interest on the May 21, 1991 judgment, and Claude appeals.</p>

We agree. The trial court erroneously varied the applicable rate of interest to arrearages that originated prior to the date on which the statutory amendments took effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We have previously stated that the “right to the payment of support becomes vested as it becomes due. Thus an order of child support is essentially a ‘judgment in monthly installments....’” <em>Carter v.

The post-judgment interest statute does not provide for the compounding of interest, and we find no basis for inferring such a provision. 14 M.R.S.A. § 1602-A. Accordingly, the trial court’s compounding of the interest awarded to Corinne was in error.</p>

In February 1975, the time of the first arrear-age, the statutory rate of post-judgment interest was 10%. 14 M.R.S.A. § 1602 (1980) <em>repealed and replaced by </em>P.L.1983, ch. 427, §§ 1-3 (removing statutory provisions for post-judgment interest to 14 M.R.S.A. § 1602-A (Supp.1992)). The legislature subsequently amended the rate to 12% effective July 1, 1980. P.L.1979, ch. 655, § 1. The legislature again amended the rate to 15% effective September 18, 1981. P.L.1981, ch. 162, § 1. The rate has remained at 15% in actions, like this, where damages sought or awarded do not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court, $30,000. 14 M.R.S.A. § 1602-A; 4 M.R.S.A. § 152(2) (1989).</p>
      <p id="A1R" data-blocks='[["BL_1276.11",1276,[1036,2170,715,560]]]'>Here, the trial court increased the statutory rates of post-judgment interest applicable to the arrearages so that, for example, an arrearage originating in 1975 accrued interest at a 10% rate through June 1980, at a 12% rate through September 17, 1981, and at a 15% rate thereafter. An arrearage, however, is subject to a fixed interest rate determined by the statutory rate of post-judgment interest effective at the time of its origin. In this case, Claude's arrearages originating prior to July 1, 1980 are subject to a fixed 10% rate; those originating between July 1, 1980 and September 17, 1981 are subject to a 12% rate; and those originating after September 17, 1981 are subject to a 15% rate.</p>
