    <p id="b915-17" data-blocks='[["BL_915.17",915,[1030,567,752,373]]]'>On July 31, 1992, a $25,413.66 judgment was entered against Delta Mining Company (Delta) in the Allegany County Circuit Court in Maryland. This judgment, in favor of Marshall Ruby &amp; Sons (Ruby), made final a default judgment in the same amount which Ruby obtained after Delta failed to pay Ruby for certain heavy equipment repair services.</p>
    <p id="b915-18" data-blocks='[["BL_915.18",915,[1028,962,756,558]]]'>In order to satisfy the judgment, Ruby attempted to execute upon several pieces of construction equipment including, <em>inter alia, </em>a Pettibone L-50 hydraulic crane which was in the possession of the Brenlee Corporation (Brenlee). Ruby alleged that the execution was lawful because, although Brenlee possessed the crane, actual ownership remained with Delta at the time of the levy. Brenlee, in turn, filed a motion for release of property and, in support thereof, averred that it was the record owner of the crane.</p>
    <p id="b915-19" data-blocks='[["BL_915.19",915,[1026,1549,753,466]]]'>After holding two hearings which addressed the parties’ claims of entitlement, the Maryland Circuit Court denied Brenlee’s motion for release. In so doing, the court held that Brenlee had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it owned the disputed property at the time Ruby levied upon it. Title, therefore, remained with Delta and the crane was subject to execution in satisfaction of the $25,416.66 debt.</p>
    <p id="b915-20" data-blocks='[["BL_915.20",915,[1026,2039,752,460]]]'>Prior to the time that Ruby could take possession of the crane from Brenlee to satisfy the judgment against Delta, Stanley Michael Jeffreys, an officer of Brenlee, moved the equipment from Maryland to Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Claiming that Jef-freys had tortiously interfered with its right of possession, Ruby filed suit against Jef-freys in Maryland for the estimated value of the crane.</p>
    <p id="b915-21" data-blocks='[["BL_915.21",915,[1027,2527,751,230]],["BL_916.1",916,[210,255,756,364]]]'>On February 1,1995, the case against Jef-freys proceeded to a non-jury trial before the Honorable Paul J. Stakem. After receiving testimony, the court concluded that, although Jeffreys was aware of the prior court holding <a id="p862" href="#p862" data-label="862" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*862</a>that Brenlee had no legal interest in the crane, Jeffreys moved the property out of the jurisdiction. Further, the court held that Jeffreys’ continued possession of the crane, and his refusal to ■ disclose its exact whereabouts, was tortious. Judgment was therefore entered in favor of Ruby for $10,000, the estimated value of the crane.</p>
    <p id="b916-4" data-blocks='[["BL_916.4",916,[207,653,756,327]]]'>In November of 1995, Ruby filed a statement of foreign judgment in the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Said statement evidenced the $10,000 judgment Ruby obtained against Jeffreys in Maryland. On May 14, 1996, Jeffreys satisfied the $10,000 judgment in full.</p>
    <p id="b916-5" data-blocks='[["BL_916.5",916,[205,1007,753,507]]]'>On July 30, 1996, Ruby filed a second statement of foreign judgment in the Bed-ford County Court of Common Pleas. This second statement reflected the $25,413.66 judgment entered in Maryland against Delta and in favor of Ruby. Ruby next filed a praecipe for writ of execution in Bedford County indicating Ruby’s wish to levy upon the hydraulic crane still possessed by Jef-freys in order to satisfy the judgment against Delta.</p>
    <p id="b916-6" data-blocks='[["BL_916.6",916,[203,1549,754,603]]]'>A sheriffs sale was scheduled for November 7, 1996. Prior to the sale, however, Jeffreys filed an objection in the Bedford County Court of Common Pleas. Therein, Jeffreys claims actual ownership of the crane, tracing title from Delta to Brenlee to Jeffreys. In response, Ruby filed a petition for supplementary relief in aid of execution pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 3118. Said petition requests the immediate release of the crane from Jeffreys to Ruby in full satisfaction of the $25,413.66 debt owed to Ruby from Delta.</p>
    <p id="b916-7" data-blocks='[["BL_916.7",916,[204,2185,751,422]]]'>On November 7, 1996, the Court of Common Pleas held a hearing on Jeffreys’ objections and Ruby’s petition. After receiving testimony and exhibits from Ruby and Jef-freys, the court denied Ruby supplementary relief.

    <p id="b916-11" data-blocks='[["BL_916.11",916,[1005,1347,753,319]]]'>In the instant matter, it is undisputed that an underlying judgment in the amount of $25,413.66 exists against Delta in favor of Ruby. Our initial focus, therefore, is upon the second prerequisite to relief; that is, whether the disputed property is subject to execution.</p>
    <p id="b916-12" data-blocks='[["BL_916.12",916,[1003,1710,751,657]]]'>In order to answer this inquiry, we must first determine whether the subject property was owned by Delta at the time of the levy. This question, however, has been resolved by our Maryland colleagues. As previously stated, the Maryland Circuit Court issued an order on March 24, 1994, finding the purported transfer of the crane’s title from Delta to Brenlee/Jeffreys ineffectual due to the parties’ failure to comply with certain mandatory provisions of the Maryland Transportation Code. Consequently, title to the crane remained with Delta at the time of the levy despite Jeffreys’ possession.</p>
