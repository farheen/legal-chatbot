Valerie’s proposed visitation plan offers Greg non-school days of visitation with Erica, including: (1) eight weeks each summer, (2) one or two weeks at Christmas (even and odd years respectively), (3) both spring breaks, (4) Thanksgiving break on even years, (5) all three-day weekends (one every other month), and “any other visitation which Greg requests, so long as it does not interfere with Erica’s schooling, and can be arranged in advance.” In the affidavit accompanying her motion, Valerie stated, “I want this court to understand that I am more than open to discussing any further reasonable visitation that Greg seeks to have or that this Court would think that he should receive.’ ’</p>
    <p id="b610-9" data-blocks='[["BL_610.10",610,[233,1684,1128,405]]]'>We conclude that Valerie’s proposed visitation plan is more generous and financially feasible than other plans previously accepted by this court. <em>See, e.g., Trent, </em><a href="/nev/111/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="111 Nev. 309" data-case-ids="11921735" data-case-paths="/nev/111/0309-01">111 Nev. at 316-17</a>, <a href="/nev/111/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="111 Nev. 309" data-case-ids="11921735" data-case-paths="/nev/111/0309-01">890 P.2d at 1314</a> (holding that frequent visits by plane were adequate substitute for more regular local contact); <em>Schwartz, </em><a href="/nev/107/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="107 Nev. 378" data-case-ids="8557382" data-case-paths="/nev/107/0378-01">107 Nev. at 385</a>, <a href="/nev/107/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="107 Nev. 378" data-case-ids="8557382" data-case-paths="/nev/107/0378-01">812 P.2d at 1272</a> (holding that extended summer visitation adequately replaced weekend visitation).

In view of this court’s decision on other issues, the award of attorney fees must also be reversed. However, an award of attorney fees may be appropriate upon reevaluation of Valerie’s motion to relocate. Duff v. Foster, <a href="/nev/110-2/1306-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="110 Nev. 1306" data-case-ids="8558349" data-case-paths="/nev/110-2/1306-01">110 Nev. 1306</a>, <a href="/nev/110-2/1306-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="110 Nev. 1306" data-case-ids="8558349" data-case-paths="/nev/110-2/1306-01">885 P.2d 589</a> (1994) is cited for the proposition that attorney fees are <a id="p1461" href="#p1461" data-label="1461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1461</a>not allowable in post-divorce proceedings. The award of attorney fees in <em>Duff </em>was considered on the basis of NRS 18.010(2)(b) which allows for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party “when the court finds that the claim ... of the opposing party was brought without reasonable ground or to harass the prevailing party.’ ’ To the extent that <em>Duff </em>does not recognize that attorney fees may be awarded in post-divorce proceedings under NRS 125.150(3), that decision is overruled. In Leeming v. Leeming, <a href="/nev/87/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="87 Nev. 530" data-case-ids="4834212" data-case-paths="/nev/87/0530-01">87 Nev. 530</a>, 532, <a href="/nev/87/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="87 Nev. 530" data-case-ids="4834212" data-case-paths="/nev/87/0530-01">490 P.2d 342</a>, 343 (1971), this court held that the power of the court to award attorney fees in divorce actions remains part of the continuing jurisdiction of the court in appropriate post-judgment motions relating to support and child custody. <em>Leeming </em>was recently cited with, approval in Love v.
