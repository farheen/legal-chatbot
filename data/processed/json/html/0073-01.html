    <p id="b132-33" data-blocks='[["BL_132.31",132,[996,1734,754,888]]]'>Appellant presents the following issues for review: (1) whether the trial court erred in applying the interest rate set forth in a prior court order and decree, which provided for the payment of interest at a rate in excess of the maximum statutory rate; (2) whether an individual can waive application of the usury law by agreeing to an interest rate in excess of that provided by the statute; (3) whether the trial court erred in calculating the amount owed to appellee by providing for compound rather than simple interest; and (4) whether the trial court erred in computing the amount owed to appellee by permitting appellee to recover interest on the debt after the date on which appellant tendered a lesser sum in compromise of the parties’ dispute.

John Braun died testate on April 9, 1973. Mr. Braun’s will directed his executor to pay his just debts and funeral expenses from assets of the estate. The will further devised the remainder of the estate to the decedent’s wife, Maurine Braun, who is the appellant herein. Mr. Braun’s estate consisted solely of a tract of realty which was valued in 1973 at $10,500.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[140,744,754,1530]]]'>The decedent’s funeral expenses amounted to $1,316.00. When full payment was not made, appellee, Stewart Barnhill/Stewart Barnhill Funeral Home, filed a claim against the estate which was identified in the executor’s account. Due to the illiquidity of the estate, the executor was unable to satisfy the claim absent a sale of the decedent’s only asset. To avoid this result and preserve the land for the decedent’s widow, the parties agreed that appellee’s claim would become a charge against the realty. Accordingly, an adjudication and decree of distribution, dated July 1, 1975 as well as a separate order, dated June 20, 1975, were entered creating a lien on the property for the balance owed to appellee together with interest at a rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. The June order further provided for payment in the sum of $50.00 per month until the principal and interest accruing on the unpaid balance were paid in full. Following entry of the June order and final decree, appellant made four monthly payments in the sum of $50.00 upon the debt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant made no further payments after October, 1975. Appellant likewise did not seek review of either the June order or the final adjudication and decree within the time period prescribed by law. The charge against the property was subsequently recorded and indexed as a lien on the estate in September, 1977.</p>

Appellee refused to accept appellant’s offer of partial payment. As the parties were unable to settle their dispute, appellant filed a petition in October, 1993 requesting that the court compute the amount of the debt from July, 1975 using a rate of 6% simple interest and directing that the lien be discharged upon payment. By order entered on November 30, 1993 the trial court determined that appellant owed appellee the sum of $4,534.32 as of November 23, 1993 and provided that the lien would be discharged upon payment.

Because these issues are interrelated they will be addressed together. With respect to these matters, appellee contends that appellant is precluded from challenging the provisions of the 1975 order and decree and the interest rate specified therein pursuant to the provisions of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code (“PEF Code”), 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3521 and res judicata principles. Appellant, however, responds that appellee has waived this claim because appellee failed to raise it in the lower court proceedings. Although appellee neither recited the words “res judicata” nor referenced the PEF Code, he asserted that the prior order and decree affixing the interest rate were final and that appellant’s claims were waived by her failure to appeal therefrom. <em>See </em>Creditor’s Brief in Opposition to Petition to Discharge Property from Lien, filed 11/22/93, at 2. This argument sufficiently apprised the lower court that appellant’s attempt to challenge the pri- or order and decree was precluded by the finality principles which underlie both the PEF Code and the doctrine of res judicata. Appellee thus adequately preserved this matter for review. <em>See, e.g., American Association of Meat Processors v. Casualty Reciprocal Exchange, </em><a href="/pa/527/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="527 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1827735" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0059-01">527 Pa. 59</a>, 67, <a href="/pa/527/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="527 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1827735" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0059-01">588 A.2d 491</a>, 495 (1991) (affirmative defense of illegality was not waived even though it was raised for the first time in post-trial motions).</p>

Appellee credited these payments towards the principal instead of attributing a portion thereof to the interest which had accrued. Consequently, the principal balance remaining on the account was $1,116.00 as of October, 1975 when the last payment was made. After appellant defaulted on her payments, appellee began computing simple interest on the debt in accordance with the 1975 order and decree. Accrued interest was thus added to the principal balance at the end of each year to arrive at a new principal balance, such that by October 8, 1993, appellant owed appellee the sum of $4,459.53.</p>

    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[199,489,756,705]]]'>I believe that appellant is only entitled to simple interest each year on the original principal of $1,116. At an 8% rate, this amounts to adding $89.28 to the amount owed by appellee each year. After 18 years, the time at which our litigants currently stand, the amount owed would have swelled to $2,723.04. Only by <em>compounding </em>interest each year for 18 years does one arrive at the even greater sum of $4,459.56.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> This is precisely what was done below and is what the Majority have described in their opinion. Indeed, in its opinion dated February 11, 1994, the court below candidly admitted at page two that the interest here was compound.</p>

From my reading of their opinion, the Majority appear to be interpreting <em>Ralph Myers </em>to embrace the concept that simple interest assessed each year merges with the principal and becomes the new principal upon which simple interest is calculated the next year. To me, this is simply another way of describing compound interest.</p>

Rather, I believe that <em>Ralph Myers </em>merely holds that where the original judgment or award contains an interest component, it does not amount to the compounding of interest to allow simple interest to be assessed each term on the total amount of the judgment until full payment is made. However, <em>Ralph Myers </em>still called for the assessment of <em>simple </em>interest only upon that original award. <em>Ralph Myers </em>merely addressed the question of what constitutes the total award on which interest then accrues.</p>

In the second action of debt, the recovery would be, of the amount of the sum recovered recovered in the first action of debt, with interest; and so, <em>toties quoties. </em>This is the principle contended for by the plaintiff. Nor is there any thing against equity in it. The payment of interest is occasioned by the default of the defendant. It is equitable, that he should pay interest on the whole sum detained from the plaintiff. And at each time when the plaintiff obtains judgment on a <em>scire facias, </em>the defendant, who makes default, detains from him the amount of the sum for which judgment was obtained.</blockquote>

At page 2 of its opinion, dated February 11, 1994, the trial court adopts the reasoning in a “Brief in Opposition to Petition to Discharge Property from Lien.” That document urged that compound interest should be imposed because the parties had effectively agreed to it. In adopting this analysis, I believe that the court makes a combined finding of fact and conclusion of law with which I cannot agree. The only "agreement” here was in the form of a prior order of court, which stated, in pertinent part, "Mrs. Braun is to pay $50.00 a month on the 10th of each succeeding month until the principal and interest are paid off in full, at the rate of 8% interest on the unpaid balance.” The court below has interpreted "unpaid balance” to refer-to both principal and interest. I do not share that interpretation, but rather believe the "agreement” to be wholly ambiguous on this point. Thus, I would find no express agreement to pay compound interest.</p>
