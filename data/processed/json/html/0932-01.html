Mr. Flori now appeals, advancing three arguments in support of his claim that the trial justice committed reversible error. The defendant’s primary contention is that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial based upon improper jury instructions. He alternatively submits that either his conviction should be vacated or his sentence reduced to conform to a misdemeanor conviction. Secondly, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly granted the state’s motion to amend the criminal information before trial began. Thirdly, he contends that the trial justice improperly admitted into evidence irrelevant and prejudicial testimony at trial. We issued an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

At the time of the alleged larceny, Pio was living in Cranston, Rhode Island, in the basement apartment of his parents’ home. There, he stored a large sum of money — approximately $47,-000 — in a safe that was located in the bottom of his closet. According to Pio’s testimony, he occasionally removed or added cash to the safe. The safe was secured by a lock and key. Pio kept the key to the safe on his keychain, which he occasionally left on the kitchen counter in his apartment. Pio’s mother had the only other copy of the key, which she kept in the nightstand in her bedroom.</p>

David testified that he believed the key belonged to a safe. After a lengthy search, he found a safe in the closet of Pio’s apartment. Upon locating the safe, he inserted the key to see whether it fit, but asserted that he did not open the safe. He then returned the key to where he found it. David testified that he later told defendant about the key and the safe that he had found; he claims that he did not tell anyone else.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> According to David, when he told defendant about the key, defendant inquired about what the safe contained, and David informed him that he had not opened the safe. David testified that defendant later asked him about the key and safe on at least three or four occasions. Eventually, David showed defendant where the key and safe were located. David testified that he waited in another room while defendant opened the safe. The defendant told David that there was a large amount of money in the safe.</p>

The second time defendant opened the safe, he took $3,000, of which he gave $1,000. to David later that same day. David claimed that defendant gave him the money to keep quiet. Over the course of that summer, David witnessed defendant removing money from the safe twice; defendant also informed David that he had taken money from the safe three or four more times. David testified that defendant gave him “a lot” of money over the course of the summer, totaling approximately $10,000. Throughout his testimony, David recounted purchases defendant made during this period — including various dirt bikes, automobiles, clothes and shoes — even though defendant did not have steady employment at the time. David’s sister, who at one time was defendant’s girlfriend, also testified about these purchases, describing them as outside his normal budget.</p>

Although he originally told the police that all the money was missing, he testified at trial that $8,000 to $11,000 remained in the safe when he noticed the theft. Pio stated that the last time he had counted the money was around March 2004 and that, at that time, there had been about $47,000 in the safe.</p>

Several months later, however, David confessed to his grandfather that he had stolen money from the safe and that defendant was involved.</p>

On July 20, 2006, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the charge of larceny over $500, but it convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit larceny.

In instructing the <a id="p936" href="#p936" data-label="936" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*936</a>jury on the charge for conspiracy to commit larceny, the trial justice did not specifically state that a guilty verdict required a finding that defendant conspired to commit larceny for a monetary amount exceeding $500. The defendant’s only objection, however, concerned the length of the conspiracy instruction. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for a new trial based upon the omission in the conspiracy charge that the amount of money conspired to be stolen must exceed $500. He argued that this error necessitated a new trial or, alternatively, that his sentence should reflect the maximum penalty allowed for larceny of less than $500.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The trial justice denied the motion on the ground that the instructions, viewed holistically, were sufficient to put the jury on notice that the conspiracy charge required an agreement to steal over $500. Noting that the jury had been provided with a written copy of his instructions, the trial justice observed that the instruction he had given on larceny over $500 specifically included the element that the money taken had to exceed the value of $500. Immediately thereafter, he instructed the jury on the crime of conspiracy to commit larceny, stating to the jurors that he had “just given [them] a definition of the crime of larceny.” Reasoning that the only definition of larceny the jurors had received encompassed the requirement that the amount stolen exceed $500, he concluded, “I don’t think there is any question in that regard that the definition of conspiracy to commit larceny included the felony aspect of it.”</p>

Specifically, he contends that Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a new trial may be granted “if required in the interest of justice” and that, in this case, the interests of justice clearly require such relief. The defendant asserts that the error here is of constitutional proportions, in that (1) the failure to instruct on the monetary amount violated his Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine his guilt on every element of the crime charged, and (2) absent a jury finding on the amount of money involved in the conspiracy charge, the statutory maximum penalty could not exceed that for a misdemeanor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Specifically, defendant contends that the error “implicates the <em>Apprendi-line </em>of decisions from the United States Supreme Court, holding that any fact that permits a trial court to exceed the statutory maximum penalty must be found by the jury.” <em>See Cunningham v.

Although the state admits that a new trial may be ordered for an error of law, pursuant to Rule 33, the state argues that this does not alter the contemporaneous objection requirement of Rule 30. Additionally, the state maintains that defendant’s only recourse is an argument that the challenged instruction substantially placed into doubt the fundamental fairness or integrity of the trial result.

The trial justice granted the motion because various documents in the court record referred to the summer of 2004— including the original police affidavit, the police report given by Pio, witness statements, and the arrest warrant — which were provided to the defense several months before trial.

Even if we addressed the merits of defendant’s argument, we would hold that the trial <a id="p939" href="#p939" data-label="939" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*939</a>justice properly denied the motion for a new trial. In this case, the trial justice began his instructions with count 1, larceny over $500. During this portion of the charge, he mentioned at least four times that the crime charged required a finding that the amount of money taken exceed a value of $500. After his instruction on count 1, the trial justice instructed the jury on count 2, conspiracy to commit larceny. He charged the jury that, “[i]n [cjount 2 of the information the defendant has been charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit larceny. Now, I have just given you a definition of the crime of larceny." Although the subsequent definition of conspiracy to commit larceny given to the jury did not include a specific monetary amount, viewing the instructions as a whole, we are of the opinion that the jurors must have understood that the conspiracy charge also required that the amount of money exceed $500. Not only did the trial justice cross-reference the pertinent definition of larceny in the conspiracy charge, the court provided the jurors with only that one definition of larceny, which included the monetary threshold requirement. Furthermore, as all the evidence presented involved sums of money exceeding $500, the jurors could not have been misled to the prejudice of defendant.</p>
