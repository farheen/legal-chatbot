As Appellant was waiting, she was hit from behind by the car being driven by Appellee. Appellant’s ear then bumped into the car in front of her, resulting in a three car accident. As a result of the accident, Appellant suffered cervical subluxation and frequent migraine headaches. Appellant began treatment with a chiropractor for her medical injuries, but, because her condition did not improve, she was subsequently referred to a neurologist.</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[208,918,752,715]]]'>¶ 3 At the time of the accident, Appellant had an automobile insurance policy in which she had elected the limited tort option with a first party $10,000 medical benefit. On October 11, 2000, almost two years after the accident, Appellant requested copies of her insurance file to determine how much of her $10,000 medical benefit had been consumed, which, at that time, amounted to approximately $5,000. Shortly thereafter, the two-year statute of limitations (calculated from the date of the accident) expired for a possible negligence claim against Appellee.</p>

When Appellant failed to make progress on her then current medical regimen, Appellant’s doctor modified her treatment, which entailed prescribing different and more expensive medications. Accordingly, Appellant exhausted her entire $10,000 medical benefit by November of 2001, and Appellant was forced to personally defray the costs of her continuing medical treatment.</p>

Advancing the affirmative defense of expiration of the two-year statute of limitations for a cause of action grounded on negligence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(2), Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In her reply to Appellee’s motion for summary judgment, Appellant argued that her cause of action did not accrue until she knew or, by exercising reasonable diligence, should have known that her actual medical expenses would exceed her $10,000 first party medical benefit.

Nevertheless, on October 23, 2002, after oral arguments, the trial court denied Appellant’s requested relief and essentially reaffirmed its grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellee.

Essentially, Appellee argues that Appellant filed her notice of appeal on November 20, 2002, which is more than thirty days following entry of the summary judgment order and, moreover, Appellant’s filing of a motion for reconsideration was not effective in tolling the appeal period <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>because the trial court failed to expressly grant the motion for reconsideration.</p>

In pertinent part, Rule 1701(b)(8) indicates that when the trial court <em>expressly </em>grants reconsideration of an order that is the subject of an appeal, such grant of reconsideration renders the previously filed notice of appeal inoperative. Thereafter, the time for filing an appeal begins to run anew from the point the trial court enters a decision on reconsideration, whether or not such decision constitutes a reaffirmation of the prior, original, order. <em>Id. </em>Appellee argues that the trial court never expressly granted Appellant’s motion for reconsideration and, therefore, the appeal period was not tolled pursuant to Rule 1701(b)(3). We disagree. The certified record contains the order dated June 11, 2002, which expressly granted Appellant’s motion for reconsideration.</p>

The appellee sought to quash the appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that the appellants’ notice of appeal was filed almost five months after the Commonwealth’s original decision. Our Supreme Court declined to quash the appeal, reasoning as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="ACq" data-blocks='[["BL_631.10",631,[935,1140,717,1286]]]'>The granting of a petition for reargument within the 30 day appeal period necessarily indicates an intention by the granting court to stay the proceedings, and is in reality such a stay, in order to keep the record before that court, during reargument, pending any change or modification of the court’s initial order after reargument. In these circumstances to require appellants to file a petition for allowance of appeal within 30 days of the original order of the Commonwealth Court would have the effect of placing them in two courts at the same moment. It is legally and physically impossible for the record in any case to be pending before two separate ... courts of this Commonwealth simultaneously. Indeed, a reargument is clearly a reconsideration by a court of a particular case. To slavishly adhere, as the appellee insists, to a rule requiring a court to also issue an order staying the proceedings would be needlessly elevating mere form over substance.</blockquote>

To compel him to do so in advance of the reargument is indeed a useless, wasteful, and premature procedure. Assuming the court’s initial decision is reversed upon reargument, the litigant may not even desire to file an appeal at the later time. If an appeal is desired after the reargument, that is the appropriate time for setting the appeal procedure in motion.

Under the discovery rule, the limitations period will be tolled until the ‘plaintiff knows, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, (1) that he has been injured, and (2) that his injury has been caused by another’s conduct.’ When presented with an assertion of applicability of the discovery rule, a court must, before it applies the exception, ‘address the ability of the damaged party, exercising reasonable diligence, to ascertain the fact of a cause of action.’ The plaintiffs conduct is to be evaluated in terms of what she should have known at a particular time by following a course of reasonable diligence. ‘If a party has the means of discovery within his [or her] power but neglects to use them, his [or her] claim will still be barred.’ ”</blockquote>

Our state Supreme Court held that the two-year statute of limitations on tort actions allowed under the No-Fault Act did not begin to run until a claimant knew or, exercising reasonable diligence, should have known that her medical expenses would exceed the $750 monetary threshold specified in the No-Fault Act. <em>Id. </em>at 558-59.

Under the MVFRL, while all insurers are required to provide a minimum medical benefit in the amount of $5,000, there is no statutory minimum threshold of economic damage a potential plaintiff need suffer before she can initiate a lawsuit against her at-fault third party tortfeasor. Indeed, in relevant part, § 1705(d) of the MVFRL itself contemplates a limited tort plaintiffs retaining her right to sue: “Each person who elects the limited tort alternative <em>remains eligible </em>to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d) (emphasis added). In other words, there is no provision in the MVFRL analogous to the one in the No-Fault Act that the plaintiff in <em>Bond </em>relied upon.

In <em>Walls, </em>this Court extended the discovery rule to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702 (dealing with the definition of “serious injury”) to toll the statute of limitations until a plaintiff knew or, exercising reasonable diligence, should have known that she had suffered a “serious injury.” In <em>Walls, </em>the plaintiffs injury changed and became more serious as time passed. <em><a href="/a2d/700/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="700 A.2d 532" data-case-ids="11900357" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0532-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/700/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="700 A.2d 532" data-case-ids="11900357" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0532-01">at 534</a>. Instantly, Appellant does not contend that her symptoms or diagnosis worsened during the two-year period during which she could have brought suit. Instead, Appellant miscalculated the cost of any continuing medical care. There is no case law that supports Appellant’s legal position. Indeed, current case law cautions against what Appellant is suggesting.</p>

Pocono Produce Inc., </em><a href="/pa/503/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="503 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1785922" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0080-01">503 Pa. 80</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="503 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1785922" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0080-01">468 A.2d 468</a>, 471 (1983), our state Supreme Court held that the statute of limitations for a cause of action “begins to run as soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises; lack of knowledge, mistake or misunderstanding do not toll the running of the statute of limitations.” Generally, “a party asserting a cause of action is under a duty to use all reasonable diligence to be properly informed of the facts and circumstances upon which a potential right of recovery is based and to institute suit within the prescribed statutory period.” <em><a href="/pa/503/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="503 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1785922" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0080-01">Id.</a> </em>“In most cases, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the injury is sustained.” <em>Bradley, </em><a href="/pa-super/429/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="429 Pa. Super. 616" data-case-ids="934763" data-case-paths="/pa-super/429/0616-01">633 A.2d at 194</a>. Appellant knew the extent of her medical injuries on or immediately after the date of the accident and Appellant had ample time within the existing two-year statutory period to determine the extent of any future medical expenses in excess of her auto insurance policy’s first party medical benefit.</p>
    <p id="b634-7" data-blocks='[["BL_634.8",634,[1002,1757,751,760]]]'>¶ 20 The lynchpin of Appellant’s argument is that her cause of action never accrued until and unless she exhausted her first party medical benefit. Unfortunately for Appellant, there is no statutory dictate or case law commanding injured limited tort plaintiffs to first exhaust their first party medical benefit before they are permitted to initiate lawsuits against their at-fault tortfeasors that would justify the extension of the discovery rule to toll the general rule that all suits grounded on negligence must be initiated within two years of the date of the injury. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(2).</p>

    <p id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[92,782,752,973]]]'>¶ 22 Appellant’s proposition to expand the discovery rule to limited tort insured plaintiffs who have exhausted their first party medical benefit runs contrary to the jurisprudential goals of finality and resolution of disputes. A party asserting a cause of action is charged with using reasonable diligence to inform herself of the facts and circumstances upon which her right to recover is premised and diligently filing her claim within the prescribed statutory period. <em>Pocono Int’l Raceway, </em><a href="/pa/503/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="503 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1785922" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0080-01">468 A.2d at 471</a>. While courts want to preserve plaintiffs’ legal claims and afford them their day in court, there is a corresponding desire to afford actual and potential defendants repose after a reasonable amount of time has passed in which plaintiffs can file a known or potential lawsuit.</p>
    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[93,1784,753,501]]]'>¶ 23 While this Court sympathizes with Appellant’s position, adequate legal recourse existed to protect Appellant’s cause of action against Appellee. We find that the trial court neither committed an error of law nor abused its discretion in granting Appellee’s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the trial court’s order granting summary judgment is affirmed.</p>
