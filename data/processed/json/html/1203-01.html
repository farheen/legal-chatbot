The principal issue which divides the members of the Board is whether respondent proved by clear and convincing evidence significant or sufficient rehabilitation from his drug addiction to warrant suspension of disbar<a id="p1205" href="#p1205" data-label="1205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1205</a>ment with a period of probation. The majority of the members of the hearing committee which heard the evidence addressing the issue concluded that respondent had proven that he was rehabilitated, that his disbarment should be stayed, and that he should be placed on probation for three years with certain specified conditions. Respondent and Bar Counsel support the position taken by Board members who, adopting the recommendation of the hearing committee majority, recommended probation. We adopt the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and the members of the Board who favor probation for the reasons set forth in this opinion.</p>

Respondent also submitted as exhibits medical records related to his back surgeries and seven letters from judges and one hearing commissioner of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

These discussions assisted her in monitoring and assessing respondent’s progress. She also testified that respondent has submitted to random drug testing for which all results proved to be negative. The test results were introduced into evidence. Ms. Makepeace described substantial, positive changes in respondent’s attitude and understanding of his illness since she first saw him in 1987, and she rated his progress in recovery at the top of the scale. It was her opinion that the risk of respondent returning to addictive behavior was minimal.</p>

He also testified about the remarkable, positive change in respondent’s behavior since 1989. Specifically, he reported that respondent had demonstrated the honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness to recover which are essential to recovery. Mr. Polin testified that <em>in </em>addition to maintaining sobriety over an approximately four year period, respondent has completed three of the twelve steps of the AA/NA recovery program, has started the fourth step, and is discussing other steps,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> consistent with the process. According to Mr. Polin, respondent has expressed a willingness to make restitution, an element of one of the later steps in the recovery program. Respondent has volunteered his services to Oxford House,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and he has led AA/NA meetings. Mr. Polin stated that respondent had incorporated his program of recovery into all aspects of his life and that it is not likely that one could fake for two years the sincere efforts at recovery that respondent has displayed. Mr. Polin was of the opinion that even if the threat of disbarment were removed, respondent would continue with his recovery efforts.

The committee observed that respondent has done all he was required to do by his monitor-sponsor and by Ms. Mak-epeace and that he has apparently maintained high standards in his legal practice. In addressing whether respondent would continue in this manner if the threat of disbarment were lifted, the committee relied primarily upon the opinions of Mr. Po-lin and Ms. Makepeace, who had worked closely with respondent as well as with many other recovering addicts. Both expressed confidence that respondent would continue with his recovery program in earnest. While the majority members of the hearing committee indicated that they would not be persuaded by respondent’s testimony alone, they expressly found nothing in his testimony and demeanor which would cast doubt on the opinions of Mr. Polin and Ms. Makepeace about the sincerity of his recovery efforts and his potential for continued success. Recognizing the importance that all of the experts at the earlier hearings had placed upon the recovering addict’s attendance at AA/NA meetings, the majority of the committee members found it significant that respondent had been involved completely in the recovery program for two and one-half years. Also-important to their conclusions were that respondent had been drug-free for four years, the last two and one-half years without significant setbacks, and that he ap<a id="p1207" href="#p1207" data-label="1207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1207</a>peared to desire to maintain his right to practice his profession.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> On the record, as summarized here, the hearing committee reached the following conclusion:</p>

Weighing significantly in their consideration was the fact that respondent and two of his three witnesses had reason to be biased in his favor because of respondent’s interest in the outcome and the witnesses’ relationship to him. Although not advocating that an independent medical expert be required in every case where an attorney’s rehabilitation is in issue, these Board members were of the view that such experts would be desirable in most cases to provide evidence essential for the Board’s determination.

The committee also found that respondent had been drug-free for over four years; that he had been involved fully in a program of recovery with AA/NA and regularly attended the group’s meetings. In sum, the hearing committee concluded that respondent “presented impressive evidence of a new lifestyle, built around acknowledging and dealing with his addiction, and there was no contradictory evidence presented to the Committee.” Our examination of the record indicates that the hearing committee’s factual findings and its conclusion that respondent has proven his rehabilitation by clear and convincing evidence are supported by substantial evidence of record, and we will accept them. We turn then to consideration of what mitigating effect respondent’s addiction and evidence of his rehabilitation should have on the imposition of sanctions for respondent’s misconduct.</p>

Bar Counsel, in his brief, has identified for the court various problems associated with disciplinary cases as a result of the <em>Kersey </em>holding and its progeny and the need for special procedures to address them. Among the suggested solutions are: (1) establishment of a committee specially trained in addiction issues to determine causation; (2) automatic interim suspension upon entry of a Kersey-type plea in mitigation of sanction; and (3) limitation on the types of cases in which the Kersey-type mitigation principle shall apply. While these are matters of considerable importance, they are not appropriate for resolution in this particular case. These concerns can be addressed better through the rulemaking process rather than on a case by case basis.</p>
