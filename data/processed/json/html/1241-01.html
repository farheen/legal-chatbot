The claim arises from an automobile accident which occurred in 1996. The plaintiff was a passenger in the vehicle involved. She exhausted the benefits available to her from the tortfeasor, and seeks additional benefits under her father’s insurance policy with State Farm. The policy in question defines an insured “Relative” as: “A person related to you or your spouse by blood, marriage or adoption who lives with you. It includes your unmarried and unemancipated child away at school.” The plaintiff, a divorced adult, claimed coverage as a child living with her parents.</p>
