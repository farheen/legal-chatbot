September 19, 1974, as twelve-year-old Kristen Judge got off the school bus in front of her home on Howard Hill Road in Foster, Rhode Island, she noticed a white Volkswagen van parked on the opposite side of the road. A few minutes later, Kristen walked from her house out to the road to meet a friend who was coming over for a visit.. As the two young girls walked back to Kristen’s house, they passed the van and saw a man and a young woman kissing beside the van. A short time later, they came back down the driveway and heard a girl scream. Concerned, the girls returned to the house and asked Kristen’s father if he had heard the scream. Although he had heard nothing, he accompanied the girls back out to Howard Hill Road. Seeing that the van had now gone, the girls proceeded alone toward the-Foster fairgrounds. While in front of the fairgrounds, they saw the Volkswagen van again, first heading toward Foster, and then about a minute later heading back to the spot where it had been parked when Kristen first noticed it.</p>

She also heard a car door slam several times and then the spinning of wheels. She walked out to the road and. saw the white Volkswagen van stuck in a ditch and defendant trying to figure out how to free the van from its predicament. Apprehensive because she was alone and thinking that defendant might come to use her telephone, Mrs. Tramontano called the Foster Highway Department for assistance. Two members of the department arrived shortly at her house. While she spoke to them outside, defendant walked up, explained that his van was stuck, and asked for help. The road men and defendant then walked back down to the van.</p>

While the road men had been inspecting the problem, defendant entered the van. As the officer tried to help him out, defendant seemed very agitated, gasping for breath, muttering, and struggling. The officer handcuffed him, and the road men restrained him on the ground. While restrained defendant muttered that he had picked up a male and a female hitchhiker and that they had given him some white powder that “worked fast.” Believing that defendant might need some medical assistance for drug intoxication, the police officer called for an ambulance and also a wrecking crew. The defendant continued to mumble about the hitchhikers, saying that the man had been beating up the girl. When the medical crew arrived, they strapped the struggling defendant to a stretcher. Meanwhile, the wrecker operator, who had walked into the woods, came out and reported that he had found a female body, partly naked, badly beaten, and bloodied.</p>

The defendant originally stated that he had picked up the girl and a man named “Donald,” and that “Donald” had beaten the girl.

The defendant then abruptly changed his story, confessing that he, and not “Donald,” had struck the girl. The police recorded the confession.</p>

The trial justice denied this motion and, over defendant’s objection, admitted the taped confession into evidence. At trial, defendant relied principally on an insanity defense and presented expert witnesses who testified to his mental state at the time of the homicide. At the conclusion of the state’s case, the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon was dismissed. The jury found defendant not guilty of assault with intent to rape, but found him guilty of murder in the second degree, and sane.</p>

Captain Pare testified that he first saw Arpin at 4:25 p. m. being removed from the ambulance handcuffed and strapped to a stretcher, and noted that at the time defendant was squirming and appeared excited. After the medical crew released defendant and removed the handcuffs, he accompanied Pare to his office in the police station, where two other officers joined them. Before asking any questions, Pare informed Arpin that he was a murder suspect, informed him of his constitutional rights, and gave him the warnings set out in <em>Miranda v.

Captain Pare described Arpin’s demeanor in the office as “somewhat calm” and “coherent.” The defendant initially told the fabricated story of “Donald” in a rational, coherent manner, according to Pare.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Captain Pare also testified that he used no force or coercion and made no threats or promises. Captain Pare concluded the initial interview at about 5:15 or 5:30 p. m. and asked Detective Pineau to continue the interrogation.</p>

Captain Pare reentered the office and said that a young female eyewitness had stated that only one man and one girl were in the van. He also said that the man she described was Ronald Arpin.

      <a id="p1346" href="#p1346" data-label="1346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1346</a>Our examination of the record reveals facts that might possibly lead a trial justice to rule that the waiver and the confession were involuntary. For example, defendant was clearly agitated at the murder scene where he was handcuffed and strapped to a stretcher. He had consumed some intoxicants earlier in the day,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and he had a history of mental disorders. We have taken full cognizance of these factors. From our examination of the cases cited by defendant, however, we find even these facts distinguishable from the facts that have motivated other courts to find involuntariness. In <em>Blackburn v. Alabama, <a href="/us/361/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="361 U.S. 199" data-case-ids="6167093" data-case-paths="/us/361/0199-01">supra,</a> </em>for example, prior to the crime and the confession, the defendant had escaped from a mental institution in which he had been confined for four years to receive treatment for paranoid schizophrenia. Moreover, the custodial interrogation in <em>Blackburn </em>lasted for over nine hours, and the police practices were questionable. In <em>Gladden </em>v. <em>Unsworth, <a href="/f2d/396/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="396 F.2d 373" data-case-ids="2148419" data-case-paths="/f2d/396/0373-01">supra,</a> </em>the defendant confessed in a drunken stupor. Witnesses testified that his pupils were dilated and that he was “jabbering,” “babbling,” and “raving.” At the time of the confession, he could not stand and perform simple movements without extreme difficulty. In <em>Pea v. United States, supra, </em>the defendant had shot himself in the head, causing himself to sustain a concussion, and had not been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to interrogation in the emergency room. The court emphasized in particular the testimony of a doctor who found the defendant to be totally indifferent to protecting himself. In <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Picard, <a href="/f2d/452/0860-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="452 F.2d 860" data-case-ids="783401" data-case-paths="/f2d/452/0860-01">supra,</a> </em>the defendant did not remember committing the crime. Furthermore, he had been suffering from prolonged depression and had wandered about aimlessly in the woods for a long period after the homicides. In <em>Eisen </em>the record revealed that the trial justice gave short shrift to the insanity issue in his ruling on the motion to suppress and that his instruction to the jury on the voluntariness issue was not totally objective. <em>Eisen v. Picard, </em><a href="/f2d/452/0860-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="452 F.2d 860" data-case-ids="783401" data-case-paths="/f2d/452/0860-01">452 F.2d at 864</a>. In <em>Reddish v.

In the instant case, however, we believe that defendant’s fabricated exculpatory narration in which he claimed that a fictitious “Donald” committed the homicide, his four clear, affirmative responses to questions about understanding his rights, and his persistent willingness to waive them, all support the trial justice’s ruling.

In light of these factors we first analyzed the effect of full retroactivity of the <em>Johnson II </em>rule. As a practical matter, all defendants tried and convicted under the <em>M’Naghten </em>test would have been able to apply for post conviction relief and seek new trials. <em>See </em>G.L.1956 (1969 Reenactment) § 10-9.1-1 and § 10-9.1-3, both enacted by P.L.1974, ch. 220, § 3. We recognized that full retroactive application would most likely have been consistent with the purpose of the new rule: to ensure that a certain class of wrongdoers deemed mentally incompetent is given psychiatric treatment in mental institutions rather than continue to be confined without treatment in correctional institutions. <em>United States v. Freeman, </em><a href="/f2d/357/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="357 F.2d 606" data-case-ids="835918" data-case-paths="/f2d/357/0606-01">357 F.2d 606</a>, 626 (2d Cir. 1966). At the same time, however, we felt that the reliance placed by all parties on the <em>M’Naghten </em>rule was substantial and that such reliance would have been undermined by full retro-activity.

And most important, we concluded that full retroactivity would have placed an unacceptable burden on the administration of justice, requiring new trials on an issue that depends heavily for its proper resolution upon the testimony of lay and expert witnesses. The risk that witnesses who testified at the earlier trials would no longer be available would have been sizable; and without the necessary witnesses, there could be no guarantee that the new trials would be effective in properly determining the issue of guilt or innocence.</p>

The defendant argues, however, that granting Bruce Johnson a new trial, while denying a new trial to Ronald Arpin, whose appeal might have reached this court ahead of Johnson’s, is arbitrary and inequitable, and is to administer justice on the basis of a “judicial horse race.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In response to this contention, we make two points: first, prospective application of a rule, that is, announcing a rule for the future while affording its benefits to the litigants at bar is appropriate judicial procedure. <em>See Balts v. Balts, </em><a href="/minn/273/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="273 Minn. 419" data-case-ids="348287" data-case-paths="/minn/273/0419-01">273 Minn. 419</a>, <a href="/minn/273/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="273 Minn. 419" data-case-ids="348287" data-case-paths="/minn/273/0419-01">142 N.W.2d 66</a> (1966). It avoids the criticism that the new rule is pure dictum and provides a worthy incentive to the defendants and their counsel to advocate beneficial changes in the law. Second, in view of our strong opinion that full retroactivity of the <em>Johnson II </em>rule would have been inappropriate, we feel that drawing the line where we did was neither inequitable nor arbitrary. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that any decision to apply a new rule of law requires some linedrawing. In drawing the line, however, we attempt to reach a result that serves all parties and to avoid arbitrary distinctions based upon the stage of the appellate process at which <a id="p1349" href="#p1349" data-label="1349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1349</a>a case happens to be at the time of the decision announcing the new rule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
