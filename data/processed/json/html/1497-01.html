So, the real problem confronting appellee was to put the active extractives of cod-liver oil into the form of a dry medicinal agent. Having conceived this idea, and having actually produced cod-liver oil tablets, it was not necessary that any given number of the tablets contain a particular quantity of active extracted ingredients of cod-liver oil. The counts are not so limited. ISTor was it neessary that appellee exploit his invention in order to complete it.</p>
