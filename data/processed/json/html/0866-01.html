We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b897-16" data-blocks='[["BL_897.17",897,[886,428,754,559]]]'>In its Petition, the FOTP sought to represent a unit of transit police officers employed by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) for purposes of collective bargaining under Act 111, the Act of June 24,1968, P.L. 237, 43 P.S. §§ 217.1-217.10. The Petition stated, “The employer is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth within Act 111. Certification pursuant to Act 111 therefore is appropriate.” (R.R. at 6a.)</p>

In addition, the PLRB concluded that SEPTA did not fall within the definition of “political subdivision” in section 1991 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Finally, the PLRB stated that, unlike political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, SEPTA does not have the power to levy taxes, which means that SEPTA lacks the ability to fund an Act 111 interest arbitration proceeding. In other words, any agreement reached by the FOTP on behalf of the transit police in collective bargaining would be unenforceable. <em>See Philadelphia Housing Authority v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, </em><a href="/pa/508/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="508 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1794081" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0576-01">508 Pa. 576</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="508 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1794081" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0576-01">499 A.2d 294</a> (1985).</p>

(FOTP’s brief at 9.) The PLRB contends, however, that the only assertion made in the FOTP’s Petition was that SEPTA is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. (PLRB’s brief at 10.) We have reviewed the FOTP’s Petition and agree with the PLRB. <em>(See </em>R.R. at 6a.) Rule 1551(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that, except in certain situations that do not apply here, no question shall be considered by this court which was not raised before the government unit.

In <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em>our supreme court indicated that, to. determine the meaning of “Commonwealth” in Act 111, it was necessary to resort to the definition set forth in section 1991 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972. Section 1991 defines the word “Commonwealth” as “The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” 1 Pa. C.S. § 1991.
