The Justice’s conclusion, however, that the plaintiff’s title to the property south of the line was undisputed is not supported by the record. The defendants unequivocally raised the plaintiff’s title to the premises described in the complaint when they denied the plaintiff’s title in their answer, listed the issue in their pre-trial memorandum and again made it the basis of their motion for a new trial.

The deeds which the plaintiff introduced into evidence without objection, while indicating that he may own land in Gouldsboro, in no way fix any sufficiently identifiable location on the face of the earth to relate the property described in those deeds to the disputed area. These deeds describe the land which they purport to convey in general terms, such as “the Ward lot,” “lot number 74,” or in references to previous conveyances. Where metes and bounds have been used, there is nothing in this record to establish any relationship between the land so described and the land demanded in the complaint. While deeds introduced by the defendants seem to establish the discontinued roadway as the southern boundary of their lot, they are of no assistance in shedding any light upon the title to the land immediately south of the boundary so established.</p>
