The real party in interest, though, is the City who has agreed to reimburse Claimant for any sums he had to pay to satisfy Employer’s subrogation claims.

Eventually, Claimant entered into a settlement agreement with the City in which he received $150,000 in damages as well as indemnification by the City of any subrogation he had to pay to Employer.

Claimant then appealed to the Board, which affirmed. The Board found that Section 23 of Act 44 did not excuse a claimant from his Section 319, 77 P.S. § 671, obligation to reimburse an employer for workers’ compensation paid when a claimant received compensation from a governmental tortfeasor.

The rationale underlying the right to sub-rogation is threefold — it prevents a claimant from receiving a double recovery for the same injury, it prevents the employer from having to make compensation pay<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>ments for injuries which were the result of a third-party’s negligence, and it prevents the third-party from escaping liability. <em>Bentler. </em>The right to subrogation for an employer then is not based on the right of the claimant to maintain a suit against a third-party, but is, instead, an absolute right granted by the Act.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[194,712,750,788]]]'>While not disputing that normally an employer has an absolute right to subrogation, Claimant contends that there is an exception when a claimant obtains tort recovery from a governmental tortfeasor. He maintains that Section 319 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 671, only provides that the employer is subrogated to the <em>right </em>of the employee to recover against a third-party. If that right does not exist, then the employer has no right of recovery. Claimant maintains that Section 23 of Act 44 vitiates the general rule because it makes the City immune from subrogation or reimbursement, which means that Employer cannot recover.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

First, Claimant’s argument that because he had no right to recovery against the City and, therefore, Employer had no sub-rogation rights, is belied by the fact that Claimant <em>did </em>file a civil action against the City and recovered. Second, granting a governmental entity “immunity from claims of subrogation or reimbursement from a claimant’s tort recovery with respect to workers’ compensation benefits” does not even remotely affect an <em>employer’s </em>Section 319 right to seek reimbursement from a claimant from a tort recovery that the claimant received from a governmental entity for the same work-related injury that employer paid compensation. Third, by its plain language, all that Section 23 of Act 44 does is provide governmental agencies with immunity from claims that failed in order to protect an employer’s workers’ compensation subro-gation claim. Because Employer is seeking subrogation from <em>Claimant </em>for the $150,000 he received from the City, not from the City itself, Section 23 of Act 44 does not foreclose Employer from enforcing its Section 319, 77 P.S. § 671, reimbursement rights.</p>

As previously explained, Section 23 of Act 44 makes the government immune if it does not protect an employer’s subrogation interest, but does not impinge on an employer’s Section 319, 77 P.S. § 671, right to be reimbursed for compensation payments from a tort recovery from a governmental body.

The Schramms rely on the fact that a subro-gee’s claim is no greater than that of the party to whose rights he is subrogated. Since Schramm is barred by Section 8553(d) from recovering as damages any amount received as workers’ compensation benefits, the subrogee can assert no interest in the money paid in settlement of the claim. The Hankees argue in a similar vein that the Commonwealth Court’s holding produces the absurd result that any verdict against a municipality would be reduced by the amount of compensation received, yet the plaintiff would still be subject to the workers’ compensation subrogation, thus having his recovery reduced a second time.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b43-6" data-blocks='[["BL_43.6",43,[159,2042,714,661]],["BL_43.7",43,[960,296,709,657]]]'>The flaw in these arguments is that, again, they beg the question. They assume that workers’ compensation payments are “benefits under a policy of insurance” for purposes of Section 8553(d). The Schramms’ argument is correct as far as it goes, but it does nothing to establish why a judgment against a municipality should be reduced by the amount of workers’ compensation payments received. The Hankees’ argument is further flawed in that it fails to follow the assumption through to its logical conclusion. If a plaintiff does not recover these damages from the third party tortfeasor/municipality, the employer (or its insurance carrier) has nothing to be subrogated to. Thus there is no second reduction of the recovery and no absurd result as argued. Conversely, if a plaintiff can recover these damages from the municipality, there is no reason why the employer (or its insurance carrier) should be denied the subrogation right provided in Section 319 of the Act.</blockquote>
