We do not read these cases as permitting the limitations period applied to a section 1983 case to vary according to whether the victim of the alleged civil rights violation died in the course of the violation. All claims brought pursuant to section 1983 must be characterized as personal injury actions governed by the general statute of limitations period applying to personal injury claims. The limitations period applied should not turn on the “general nature of section 1983 relief,” nor on “counsel’s artful pleading and ability to persuade the court that the facts and legal theories of a particular section 1983 claim [resemble] a particular common-law or statutory cause of action.” <em>Owens, </em><a href="/us/488/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="488 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="1493613" data-case-paths="/us/488/0235-01">488 U.S. at 240</a>, <a href="/us/488/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="488 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="1493613" data-case-paths="/us/488/0235-01">109 S.Ct. at 576</a>.
