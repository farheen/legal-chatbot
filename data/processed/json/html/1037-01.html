    <p id="b1085-24" data-blocks='[["BL_1085.24",1085,[939,1937,753,774]]]'>In January, 1977, the Plaintiffs, the Board of Environmental Protection, the Attorney General and the State of Maine, brought suit in Superior Court (York County) against the Defendants, Paul A. Berger-on and Faye Bergeron, under the Site Location of Development Law, 38 M.R.S.A. §§ 481 <em>et seq., </em>seeking to enjoin any conveyance of their Kennebunkport land not consistent with that Law and to recover a civil penalty. When in March, 1979, upon stipulated facts the presiding justice concluded that the Superior Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over actions for civil penalties and dismissed the action, the Plaintiffs appealed to this Court.</p>

    <p id="b1086-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1086.4",1086,[229,331,754,1414]]]'>In 1973 the Defendants purchased abutting lots of land in Kennebunkport, Maine. Between 1973 and February, 1976, the Defendants subdivided the land and without prior approval of the Plaintiff Board sold 6 lots totaling 82 acres to the general public. The parties disputed whether a road running through the land sold divided the land into two parcels of four and two lots, respectively, or whether the Defendants had subdivided a single parcel. Viewing the land as one parcel or two determines whether Board approval was necessary, for 38 M.R.S.A. § 482(5) defines the subdivisions requiring prior approval as those containing five or more lots. The Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. Before the hearing on the Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, the Defendants applied for and obtained Board approval of the subdivision, rendering moot the Plaintiffs’ prayer for an injunction. The complaint for civil penalties for each day of noncompliance remained. At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment the trial justice himself raised the question of whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction over an action for civil penalties. He went on, however, to decide the merits as well, and he entered judgment for the Defendants.</p>

The Maine Criminal Code, on becoming effective on May 1, 1976, preserved the Board’s right to recover or enforce that civil penalty in a civil action.

It may be noted in passing that (1) the civil penalty under 38 M.R.S.A. § 349(2) is not made a civil violation by the Code; (2) Section 4(3) of the Code does not apply because the statute outside the Code is not “expressly designated as a civil violation”; and (3) Section 4-A(4) of the Code does not apply because 38 M.R.S.A. § 349(2) is not a “criminal statute.” Even if it were denominated a “civil violation,” the Superior Court would have jurisdiction in any event.
