        <em>Arroyo </em>deserves closer scrutiny. In <em>Arroyo, </em>the defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to automatically provide a "no adverse inference” instruction, even without a specific request by counsel. The <em>Arroyo </em>Court noted that the defendant was correct insofar as under <em>Thompson, </em>such an instruction must be given as a matter of course unless it is expressly waived. <em>Arroyo, </em><a href="/a2d/723/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="723 A.2d 162" data-case-ids="11754303,11754452,1701944,1702002" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0162-01,/a2d/723/0162-02,/pa/555/0125-01,/pa/555/0125-02">723 A.2d at 171-172</a>. In other words, if <em>Thompson </em>had been the prevailing rule, the trial court would have erred by not giving the instruction as a matter of course. Our Supreme Court noted, however, that the <em>Thompson </em>rule did not apply retroactively to the defendant’s case. <em><a href="/a2d/723/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="723 A.2d 162" data-case-ids="11754303,11754452,1701944,1702002" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0162-01,/a2d/723/0162-02,/pa/555/0125-01,/pa/555/0125-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/723/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="723 A.2d 162" data-case-ids="11754303,11754452,1701944,1702002" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0162-01,/a2d/723/0162-02,/pa/555/0125-01,/pa/555/0125-02">at 172</a>. The Court then addressed the defendant’s related claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to request the instruction.

On the other hand, counsel may have had a reasonable basis for failing to conduct the colloquy. Specifically, counsel may have reasonably believed that the defendant did want the "no adverse inference” instruction, so counsel did not bother to engage in a colloquy because he knew he would automatically get the instruction under <em>Thompson. </em>In such a case, it may be an open factual question as to whether counsel had a reasonable basis for his belief. None of this, however, speaks to the question of prejudice for failing to conduct the colloquy.</p>

This insistence on an individualized showing of prejudice for ineffectiveness claims stands in contrast to claims of trial court error for failing to comply with the defendant's express wishes. In those cases, prejudice is now presumed. <em>Lewis, <a href="/pa/528/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="528 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1829819" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0440-01">supra;</a> Edwards, supra.</em>

However, the defendant was aware of this possibility.

Assuming that <em>Thompson </em>did announce that a <em>per </em>se rule applies, the <em>per </em>se rule in Stanley’s case may be trumped by <em>Yager, </em>which is an exception to <em>Persinger. </em>Here, if Stanley actually knew of the “no adverse inference” instruction and the reason why counsel waived it, the rationale of <em>Yager </em>might apply so that prejudice would not be presumed.

On remand, Stanley is free to attempt to present the jurors’ first-person testimony about their deliberations in order to show that Stanley was prejudiced by counsel's failure to request a <em>Thompson </em>colloquy. Stanley recognizes that such an attempt will most likely be thwarted by Pa.R.E. 606(b), which provides in pertinent part that "upon inquiry into the validity of a verdict ... a juror may not testify ... concerning the juror's mental processes in connection with [rendering the verdict].” Stanley’s Brief at 44. If the trial court pre-eludes the jurors’ testimony under Rule 606(b), Stanley may renew his argument that the rule violates due process. For the reasons set forth above, we need not address this argument at this time.</p>
