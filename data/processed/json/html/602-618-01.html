    <p id="b651-13" data-blocks='[["BL_651.14",651,[167,1685,752,403]]]'>The matter before this Court is an attorney disciplinary proceeding. The Board of Professional Responsibility (the “Board”) has filed a Final Report (the “Report”) directed to charges of professional misconduct, against the Respondent Thomas J. Motter. That report is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p id="b651-14" data-blocks='[["BL_651.15",651,[167,2115,749,195]],["BL_651.16",651,[965,238,753,398]]]'>The Board recommends the Respondent’s disbarment from the practice of law. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (the “ODC”) agrees with the Board’s recommendation for disbarment. The Respondent does not dispute the Board’s factual findings, but takes the position that the Board’s recommendation of disbarment is excessive. Because the Board’s factual findings are undisputed, our only task is to consider the appropriateness of the Board’s recommended sanction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b651-19" data-blocks='[["BL_651.20",651,[965,1478,756,655]]]'>The Court, having reviewed and considered the parties’ submissions, concludes that the Report of the Board filed on November 23, 2004, should be approved. The record reflects a pattern of misconduct in which the Respondent for five consecutive years failed to file and pay taxes, failed to maintain books and records, failed to indicate deficiencies on certificates of compliance and caused injury to three clients in separate Family Court matters. The appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment.</p>

Within ten days of this opinion, the Respondent is ordered to comply with Rule 23(a) of the Delaware Lawyers’ Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. Immediately thereafter, the Respondent shall file an affidavit with this Court indicating his compliance with Rule 23(a), as required by Rule 23(b). The ODC is directed to publicly disseminate information relating to this disciplinary proceeding, as required by Rule 14. The Respondent shall not petition for restatement until after the expiration of five years from the effective date of disbarment, as required by Rule 22(c). This matter is hereby closed.</p>
