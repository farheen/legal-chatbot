    <p id="b874-5" data-blocks='[["BL_874.5",874,[193,1230,755,801]]]'>The issues presented on appeal grew out of a distribution of cocaine charge against Price, pre-trial events and the conduct of his trial. Price was arrested on October 31, 1990, after he was caught in a buy/bust police undercover operation. Officer Wayne Marable testified that he approached Price in the 3200 block of Ely Place, S.E., showed him $50 and asked for a “20 piece” ($20 worth of crack cocaine). Price said, “Well, you might as well get a 40 piece” ($40 worth of crack cocaine), and told Officer Marable to “[sjtand right there.” Price “went around to the rear of [an] apartment building.” When he returned, he “gave [Officer Marable] one zip-lock bag with a white rock substance inside of it,” in exchange for $40.</p>

After the transaction, both officers returned to the police car and Officer Marable gave a lookout description of Price over the police radio. He described the perpetrator as a black male, wearing blue jeans, white tennis shoes, and a blue work smock. When the arrest team advised the officers that they had a suspect, Officers Marable and Leach rode by and both identified Price as the person involved in the drug transaction. Price fit the description given by Officer Marable.</p>
    <p id="b874-9" data-blocks='[["BL_874.10",874,[997,417,744,419]]]'>As part of his innocent presence and mis-identification defense, Price testified that he lived in the area and was washing a friend’s car in the 3200 block of Ely Place at the time of the drug transaction. A man by the name of “Porky” approached him and asked if he knew the man on the corner (Officer Mara-ble). After Price replied, “no,” Porky gave the man “something” and received $30.</p>
    <p id="b874-10" data-blocks='[["BL_874.11",874,[995,860,744,324]]]'>While his case was pending, Price failed to appear for one of the status hearings.

However, the trial court struck his response which recounted an alleged assault by “Porky” and others, and expressed his fear of “Porky.”</p>

The government argues that under <em>Patton v.

In addition, the government asserts that the theory of fear, in relation to the distribution of crack cocaine charge, was raised for the first time on appeal and hence may only be reviewed for plain error. Price also argues that the trial court erred in permitting the government to cross-examine him concerning whether he offered to enter a guilty plea to the drug charge; and abused <a id="p811" href="#p811" data-label="811" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*811</a>its discretion in failing to grant a mistrial. According to him, the collective errors of the trial court require reversal. Price maintains that the government’s guilty plea questions were improper impeachment material; and the trial court ignored Super. Ct.Crim. R. 11(e)(4) which generally prohibits any reference to plea bargain discussions during trial. The government argues that evidence concerning why Price failed to appear for his status date was irrelevant to the BRA charge because it did not constitute a legal defense. Further, the trial court did not commit plain error regarding the failure to appear evidence because Price did not assert its relevance to the drug charge. The government also maintains that Price opened the door to the guilty plea questions and thus the government had a right to cross-examine him under the doctrine of curative admissibility.</p>

As a result of Price’s failure to appear for the status hearing, reasonable jurors could have inferred that he was trying to flee because of his consciousness of guilt as to both charges. The government did not make the consciousness of guilt argument until closing and rebuttal, despite the fact that the trial court first recognized the potential connection between the failure to appear and possible guilt during its consideration. of the second issue set forth above, that is, whether the prosecution should have been permitted to pose cross-examination questions to Price regarding his consideration of entering a guilty plea to the drug charge. After the government’s hearsay and legal defense objections relative to the first issue (whether the trial court improperly precluded Price from explaining his failure to appear for the January 28, 1992, status hearing), the trial court ruled that Price could not explain his failure to appear by reference to “Porky’s” alleged assault of him and his alleged fear of “Porky.” Defense counsel stressed that the questioned testimony was not hearsay because it was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it was designed to explain Price’s state of mind as to why he failed to appear. He failed to appear, according to defense counsel, both because he was afraid “of Porky and these other individuals in-<a id="p814" href="#p814" data-label="814" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*814</a>volved in the drug sales on this particular block,” the repeated continuances of his case, “and because he had nothing to do with it— Nonetheless, the trial court struck Price’s explanation on the ground that it was not a legal defense to the BRA.</p>
