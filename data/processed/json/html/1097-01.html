On January 9, 1988, Burbank’s minor daughter, <a id="p1099" href="#p1099" data-label="1099" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1099</a>LuMsha Carroll, then 13, fell twelve stories into an elevator shaft when the elevator door that she leaned against opened. She was seriously and permanently injured and is presently in a vegetative state from which she will not recover. Burbank brought suit in negligence on her own behalf and on behalf of her daughter against PHA and the General Elevator Company.</p>
    <p id="b1157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1157.4",1157,[183,676,753,660]]]'>In 1991, Burbank reached a structured settlement with the elevator company. The terms of the settlement provided for an immediate cash payment to the minor in the amount of $337,600.00. Additionally, the elevator company agreed to pay to the minor $37,600.00 compounded annually at 4% for her maintenance and support for the remainder of her life. Based on the minor’s life expectancy, the court determined that the structured settlement could be worth $11,-090,811.00. Under the settlement, Burbank also receives $200 per month for a minimum of 30 years, anticipated to total $122,800.00.</p>
    <p id="b1157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1157.5",1157,[185,1362,750,277]]]'>In July 1993, Burbank reached a settlement agreement with PHA on behalf of her daughter for $250,000.00, the maximum amount payable pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522 and § 8528(b) (relating to limitations on damages).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b1157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1157.6",1157,[187,1665,750,324]]]'>Prior to the settlements, the Department of Public Welfare (DPW) assumed payment of all of the minor’s medical bills. As of January 1, 1994, DPW ceased payment. By agreement with Burbank, the settlement funds have been reduced to satisfy DPWs lien for past medical bills.</p>

(Trial Court’s December 13, 1993 opinion at 3.) The court reasoned that, in order for Burbank to become liable for any additional support, among other unspecified contingencies, the settlement amount would have to be insufficient, the health provider would have to seek payment from another source, and because, in that case, DPW “would most probably assume the payment of the difference,” DPW would then have to seek recovery against Burbank. (Trial Court’s December 13, 1993 opinion at 3.) The trial court, concluding that Burbank had no enforceable right in view of these contingencies, granted summary judgment in favor of PHA.</p>

With respect to the court’s determination that Burbank’s claims are too remote and speculative, Burbank argues that there is an issue of fact as to the adequacy of the funds provided in the settlement agreement and that such an issue precludes the entry of a summary judgment. Additionally, Burbank argues that the trial court’s assumption that the medical provider would first seek payment from DPW, as opposed to Burbank, raises a mixed question of fact and law.</p>

Even in cases in which the question is one of future medical prognosis, a claim will be sustained where the plaintiff presents “competent evidence from which the jury can reasonably determine the degree to which future consequences of a present injury are probable, and accordingly, what the amount of any damages award should be.” <em>Martin, </em><a href="/pa/508/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="508 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1793984" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0154-01">508 Pa. at 165, n. 5</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="508 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1793984" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0154-01">494 A.2d at 1094, n. 5</a>. Where the amount of damages is difficult to calculate with absolute precision, the indefiniteness does not preclude relief; rather, a claim for damages may be sustained if the amount may be fairly estimated from the evidence. <em>See Martin; Aiken Industries, Inc. v.
