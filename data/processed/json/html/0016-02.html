Medical literature abounds which confirms that variations on the appearance of a normal intact hymen are so numerous that examination and determination of the condition of the hymen requires complex application of medical and anatomical knowledge by physicians. <em>See, e.g., </em>Henry Gray, Anatomy of the Human Body, p. 1319 (Lea &amp; Febiger, 30th ed.1985). A lay person cannot “readily” identify or note the state of a hymen on observation. In fact, a physician not specifically trained in the anatomy of female genitalia, let alone pediatric female genitalia, should not be qualified as an expert witness in such cases.

Occasionally, it is cribriform, or its free margin forms a membranous fringe. It may be entirely absent, or may form a complete septum across the lower end of the vagina; the latter condition is known as an imperforate hymen.

During his trial, the prosecution presented the testimony of a gynecologist with specialized training in treating adult and child victims of sexual abuse.
