    <p id="b428-21" data-blocks='[["BL_428.21",428,[991,1094,748,419]]]'>The parties were married in 1961 and have two children. The first knowledge that the wife sought a divorce was when she caused the summons to be served upon her husband at their home in June 1965. He was, his wife agreed, a “steady earner”. The Justice on motion of the husband filed special findings of fact and conclusions of law as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b428-22" data-blocks='[["BL_428.22",428,[1027,1555,711,271]]]'>“First, this matter was tried at great length. The plaintiff produced the testimony of herself and four witnesses in her behalf and the defendant in contesting the divorce produced himself and one witness.</blockquote>

No single factual <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>claim on the part of the plaintiff standing alone supports her claim, but in aggregate they reflect a course of conduct indicating a disposition on the part of the defendant to demand, as of right, the love he deigned to win, and I rule as a matter of law that a prolonged course of conduct displeasing and injurious to the plaintiff’s health and domestic security and that of her children totals in its aggregate cruel and abusive treatment as a matter of law. I disbelieve the defendant’s protestation of condoning intercourse and find his denials of his drinking habits unconvincing.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[214,1027,749,272]]]'>The evidence fully warrants a finding of “an increasing addiction by the husband to drinking habits.” The record does not show gross and confirmed habits of intoxication, and indeed the wife does not ground her claim of divorce on such cause.</p>
    <p id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[215,1378,746,466]]]'>Drinking plays a heavy role in divorce as every Justice knows. This is not to say, however, that excessive drinking alone amounts to cruel and abusive treatment. Here we are unable to find any evidence that the drinking habits of the husband resulted in the injury to the wife, either mentally or physically, sufficient to come within the statutory cause of cruel and abusive treatment.</p>
