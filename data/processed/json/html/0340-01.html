She was awarded a verdict of $1000. Defendant appeals, claiming that it was entitled to a directed verdict. We will narrate the important elements in the case as they bear on this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b378-32" data-blocks='[["BL_378.32",378,[991,2131,751,621]],["BL_379.1",379,[144,264,749,618]]]'>Plaintiff,' expecting to board a downtown westward-bound streetcar during the morning rush hour, crossed from the south curb of Rhode Island Avenue between the intersections of 13th and 14th Streets, N. E., in order to reach a car stop at the north curb. A westbound streetcar had approached the stop on the north tracks, but because it was full did not stop to take on more passengers. Twelve or fifteen persons who had left the car stop at the north curb to board the approaching streetcar, seeing that it had not stopped, retraced their steps to the north curb. Plaintiff claimed that she started back with them. In the meantime, <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>a private automobile had stopped at the north curb to pick up some passengers, and defendant’s taxicab had stopped a few feet behind it. As plaintiff was walking from the north tracks toward the north curb she suddenly became aware that the taxicab, which had sounded no warning, was backing toward her. She jumped aside but the cab backed a second time and struck her. As usually happens in trials of this nature some of this evidence was denied (notably the failure to sound a warning before backing), some was explained, and some was shaded by plaintiff herself during cross examination.</p>

    <p id="b379-14" data-blocks='[["BL_379.13",379,[924,571,749,667]]]'>Appellant summarizes its argument on three grounds: First, that negligence is chargeable to plaintiff as a matter of law because “she chose to test a known danger” by walking across a heavily travelled boulevard highway between intersections instead of walking on the established crosswalk at 13th Street; in other words that she was taking a dangerous short cut or “jaywalking” in order to save time on a morning when she was admittedly late for work. This argument, it seems to us, would have more force if plaintiff had been struck by a vehicle moving forward in a lane of traffic instead of one starting suddenly in reverse from a parked position.</p>
    <p id="b379-15" data-blocks='[["BL_379.14",379,[923,1260,747,701]]]'>Appellant next argues that plaintiff “had actual notice of imminent danger and ignored it” because she attempted to cross from the street car tracks to the north curb, there to await the arrival of a streetcar, and because though she jumped out of defendant’s way once, she did nothing further to avoid being struck. We are not prepared to say that the circumstances required her to jump again. It may be that after the cab stopped backing, after almost striking her, she was justified in believing that the driver had seen her and that it was safe to continue walking instead of jumping a second time. This was, of course, a question of due care and was for the jury to answer.</p>

    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[229,864,748,830]]]'>As to the first of these regulations it may reasonably be argued that no question of right of way is involved between a pedestrian and a standing vehicle, especially one intending to back. As to the second regulation there was (from plaintiff’s viewpoint, at least), no apparent hazard and no vehicle "approaching” because the only two vehicles at that point were at rest, at or near the curb. In these circumstances plaintiff had the right to have the jury say whether she had in fact violated either of the regulations and if she had, whether such violation was a proximate or contributing cause of her injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> This is but repeating what we have said above and what has been authoritatively said before by our highest courts: that issues of fact and conclusions and inferences from the facts are in the jury’s domain.</p>
