The concert was shown on national television. Mr. Kitt took offense at the company’s use of an actor to portray a clarinetist during the production. He subsequently filed a complaint against Pathmakers, Inc., the concert’s production company; Jerry Colbert, the principal owner and operator of Pathmakers; and Walter Miller, the principal director of the performance, alleging: 1) Invasion of Privacy — False Light; 2) Fraud; and 3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6). This court reversed that judgment in <em>Kitt v.

Capital Concerts, Inc. is Pathmak-ers’ successor (hereinafter, we refer to Capital Concerts and its principals as “Capital Concerts”). On appeal, Mr. Kitt contends that the trial court erred in its decision because: 1) there are disputed issues of material fact; and 2) he established a prima facie case on all three counts.

    <p id="b904-5" data-blocks='[["BL_904.5",904,[200,1011,754,478]]]'>Capital Concerts had an agreement with NSO to promote and produce its July 4, 1993 concert. The contract granted Capital Concerts numerous rights, including “the exclusive right to record, edit, package, distribute and broadcast [the ojrches-tra’s performance,” and the authority to use the names and likeness of its members. Mr. Kitt performs under a contract with NSO.</p>
    <p id="b904-6" data-blocks='[["BL_904.6",904,[200,1520,755,886]]]'>At a rehearsal for the concert, Capital Concerts offered Mr. Kitt the opportunity to appear in a thirty-five second camera shot (“a beauty shot”) of a clarinetist playing, apart from the rest of the orchestra, on the balustrade of the Capitol during the opening of George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” Mr. Kitt, through management, rejected the offer, as well as a proposal that an actor pretend to “play” the clarinet for this camera shot. Despite assurances to the contrary and without NSO’s knowledge, Capital Concerts filmed the shot with an actor during the concert. The actor, who was dressed in a top hat and a tuxedo, neither physically resembled Mr. Kitt nor played the clarinet visually in the way he did.</p>

With respect to the fraud count, the trial court stated that Mr. Kitt failed to show that “he relied on misrepresentations by the defendants to induce him into performing, because his contractual obligation with NSO required him to perform.” Furthermore, the court stated that Mr. Kitt had not “assert[ed] any provable damages[, because] the concert, his earnings, performances, and private teachings have increased.” Finally, the trial court determined that Mr. Kitt’s claims of “irritation, embarrassment, sleeplessness, and angst” arising from the alleged impersonation of him, were insufficient to qualify as intentional infliction of emotional distress in light of our strict interpretation of what constitutes outrageous conduct.</p>
