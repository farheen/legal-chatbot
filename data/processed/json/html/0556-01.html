Further, the officer’s investigation could not have been safely pursued had he not patted the group down for weapons since the radio call alerted police to a gunpoint robbery. “There is no reason why an officer, rightfully but forcibly confronting a person suspected of a serious crime should have to ask one question first and take the risk that the answer might be with a bullet.” <em>Terry, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. at 33</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. 1868</a>.

Thus, although the police in <em>Short </em>had a general description of the suspect’s appearance, including his clothing, the description was not an influential factor in the court’s conclusion that the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the suspect might be connected with the crime such that an investigative stop and frisk was warranted under <em>Terry. </em>Therefore, <em>Short </em>is persuasive for the proposition that the officer here had the requisite reasonable suspicion despite the fact that the officers in the instant matter did not possess a detailed description of what the suspects were wearing.</p>

However, in <em>Berrios, </em>this Court invalidated an investigative stop that had been based solely on a report of a shooting involving three men — two “Negroes” in dark clothing and a “Puerto Rican” in light clothing. Twenty minutes after receiving the report, police stopped two men, one black and one Puerto Rican, who were walking on a street three blocks from the crime scene. Thus, after a significant passage of time, police stopped two men, when three had been reported, only three blocks from where they allegedly committed a crime, which was inconsistent with “flight” since the suspects could have traveled much further in over twenty minutes if they had been trying to flee a crime scene. Further, the suspects in <em>Berrios </em>had been walking in a normal manner and did not change their direction upon viewing police. Here, unlike <em>Berrios, </em>the officer stopped the precise number of suspects, who happened to be the only persons on the street, only one minute after the crime occurred and less than one block from the scene, and the suspects acted as if they were attempting to avoid police.</p>

In <em>Hicks, </em>police received a report that a suspected burglar was a black male with a mustache in his thirties wearing a brown coat. Police ultimately stopped the appellant four blocks away from the scene and forty-five minutes after the alleged crime, even though he did not have a mustache and was wearing a light-colored coat. This Court held that police lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the stop, because the appellant did not match the description. In the instant matter, there was no disparity between the description and the officer’s observation, the suspects were stopped within minutes of the crime being reported, and within a short distance of the crime scene, and the suspects displayed suspicious, furtive behavior upon viewing police.</p>

No further details regarding height, weight, age, clothing or other physical characteristics were provided to refine this generic description of the robbery suspects in any way. Clearly, such a description, consisting merely of race and gender and literally applicable to any group of black males in the area, falls far short of providing a specific and articulable basis for a reasonable belief that D.M. and his companions were involved in the reported robbery. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Again, I can not agree that the fact that D.M. was walking near the scene of a recently reported crime, with a group of “four or five” black males who changed their direction at the sighting of the police constitutes the type of unusual conduct which supports a conclusion of reasonable suspicion. The record reflects that when Officer Williams’ police car appeared, D.M. and his companions merely turned and <em>walked </em>in the opposite direction. Although Officer Williams did testify that the boys were “walking quickly,” the record does not reflect any testimony suggesting that the boys were running, out of breath or exhibited any other indication that they were in flight. Given the meager physical description available to Officer Williams, walking towards the scene of a recently reported crime and turning in the opposite direction of police can not, in my view, be considered inherently suspicious or reasonably suggestive of criminal activity so as to justify an investigatory stop under these circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v.
