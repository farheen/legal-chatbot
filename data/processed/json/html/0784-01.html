The dispute concerns whether Creel is entitled to benefits pursuant to Section 305.2 of the Workers’ Compensation Act (Act), Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, added by the Act of December 5, 1974, P.L. 782, 77 P.S. § 411.2.

According to Creel, “[a]ny result which would be contrary to a recovery in [his favor] would violate the spirit of the [Act] which seeks to provide compensation for those extraterrito-rially injured.” We remind Creel that pursuant to Subsection 1921(b) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b), “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” Section 305.2 is clear. An employee who is injured while working outside of the Commonwealth is entitled to benefits pursuant to the Act under the conditions specified in Subsection 305.-2(a), 77 P.S. § 411.2(a), quoted <em>supra. </em>However, in certain situations, delineated by Subsection 305.2(d)(5) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 411.-2(d)(5), an employee and an employer may, by written agreement, determine that the employment is principally localized in another state, and the agreement will be given effect if that other state accepts jurisdiction of the employee’s workers’ compensation claim.

C.S. § 1932(a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which requires parts of a statute to be read <em>in pari materia, </em>we have no doubt that Creel’s agreement with Overland must be given effect, that his employment, according to that agreement, is localized in Indiana, and that he is not entitled to benefits pursuant to the Act.</p>
