Sharon R. Stecher, Joseph Stecher and Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) have cross-appealed the judgment<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> entered in favor of Ford. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the judgment and remand this matter for a new trial consistent with this Opinion.</p>

Sharon Stecher was driving a 1983 Ford LTD westbound on a snow and ice covered road when the vehicle spun as she approached a curve. Mrs. Stecher’s vehicle crossed the center-line of the road and its front end struck an embankment on the opposite side of the road. The vehicle then spun back onto the roadway and continued to move westbound, with the driver’s side of the vehicle leading, but in the eastbound travel lane. The LTD then collided with an eastbound pickup truck. The point of impact on the LTD was approximately at the “B” pillar, the post that runs vertically from the floor to the roof of the vehicle, behind the driver’s left shoulder. Mrs. Stecher suffered a serious brain injury and a pelvic fracture as a result of the collision.</p>

The Stechers sought to preclude Ford from introducing video tapes of crash tests that had been produced for this case and from introducing any testimony based on statistics about similar incidents. Ford sought to preclude the Stechers from introducing a “Dynaman” animation that had been produced for this case and was designed to depict Mrs. Stecher’s movements within the vehicle during and after the impact. The trial court excluded both the Ford video of the crash tests and the Stechers’ Dynaman animation. The trial court refused to exclude all testimony <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>based on statistics, but directed the Stech-ers to provide specific objections to any such proposed testimony.</p>

Trial, 4/21/99, at 1905.) The trial court then elaborated: “It is the plaintiffs’ burden to establish the extent of the enhanced injuries.

Similarly, we decline to consider the parties’ arguments regarding the admissibility of particular evidence and expert testimony. On retrial, if the Stechers meet their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a defect in the Ford vehicle was a substantial factor in increasing Mrs. Stecher’s injuries, then the burden shifts to Ford to quantify the extent of those injuries caused by the alleged defect.

The evidence indicates that inclement weather and resulting road conditions caused Sharon Stecher to lose control of the LTD. Thereafter, the vehicle was hit near-side by an oncoming 1992 GMC pickup truck. The evidence established that the front grill of the truck hit the driver’s side of the LTD. As a result of the accident, Sharon Stecher sustained serious head injuries. Thereafter, the Stechers initiated a product liability action alleging the “B” pillar welds of the LTD were defectively manufactured, causing the “B” pillar to detach from the floor of the vehicle in the course of the accident and to strike Sharon Stecher in the head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">15</a>

Without describing it as such, however, the Court was reviewing this issue in a product liability case predicated upon the crashworthiness/sec-ond collision doctrine. Accordingly, in <em>Ku-petz, </em>this Court concluded the crashworthiness/second collision doctrine, as a subset of a cause of action for product liability under Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts Second, is a viable product liability theory in Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>at 1219.</p>

In other words, the <em>Fox/Mitchell </em>approach shifts the burden of proof to the defendants to establish which injuries were attributable to the defect once the plaintiff proves the defect was a substantial factor in producing the injuries. In this case, however, Ford established to the satisfaction of a jury and the court that the manufacturer defect, if any, occurred at the <em>floor </em>of the LTD and not the roof, and the concept of enhanced injury as presented by the Stechers did not occur.

In <em>Jackson, </em>the plaintiff was injured in a mul-ti-vehicle accident. A products liability action was initiated against Volkswagen, wherein the plaintiff claimed the faulty design of the seats caused her injuries. At trial, Volkswagen was permitted to introduce crash test films in which the operation of automobile seat belts was tested during rear end collisions. The jury returned a verdict against the plaintiff and, on appeal, the plaintiff claimed the trial court erred in admitting the crash test films. Based upon the trial court’s analysis of the films, this Court concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the films were properly admitted.</p>

In this case, the prejudicial and cumulative effect of the dissimilarities between the videotapes and the accident outweighed the probative value of the crash tests. Furthermore, Ford produced expert testimony, through Dr. John Habberstad, addressing the performance of vehicles in near-side impact collisions and, thus, the exclusion of the videotapes was not harmful to the defense. Accordingly, I do not believe Ford is entitled to relief on this claim.</p>

If the court finds that it is, the jury is instructed to determine only whether the negligent design of the manufacturer was a substantial factor in producing that injury.

Having reviewed the two crash tests tapes submitted by Ford, the first created December 8, 1998, the second January 13, 1999, and the accompanying documentation, I agree the trial court properly denied their admission after viewing the tapes and data as they purport to establish near side crashes in the few seconds of the collision between the GMC vehicle and the LTD Ford. I agree with the trial court that, at best, this was a thinly veiled attempt to admit Ford’s theory of the actual collision under the disguise of an illustration of general principles of science. As such, the Ford tapes had no greater validity as objective evidence than the Dynaman simulation proposed by Stecher. I agree with the trial court the impact of the tapes would be such as to influence the jury to decide on the basis of the tapes despite limiting instructions by the court.</p>
