As a result of the auto accident, Diane Tischler went into premature labor and delivered twin sons early. Jason Tischler survived, but Shawn Tis-chler died in January 1986. DPW paid $2,433 in medical assistance for Diane Tis-chler’s medical treatment, $12,061 for Jason Tisehler’s medical treatment, and $39,891 for Shawn Tischler’s treatment.</p>

In addition, DPW contends that it should be able to proceed with its subrogation action pursuant to Section 5 of the Act of June 24, 1937, P.L. 2045, 62 P.S. § 1975 (hereinafter, § 1975), which provides:</p>

    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[142,1138,752,605]]]'>We reject DEW’S argument that it is entitled to proceed with its subrogation action against Maryland Casualty pursuant to § 1975. DPW never pled § 1975 in its complaint. Furthermore, § 1975(b) requires actions based upon § 1975 to be brought in the name of the person(s) who received public assistance unless the cause of action has already been reduced to judgment. In this case, there is no allegation that the Tischlers have obtained a judgment against Maryland Casualty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

To the contrary, § 1404 addresses only the relationship between the medical assistance recipient and the provider of the medical assistance payments, providing that receiving medical assistance is contingent upon the recipient giving the department the right of subrogation to any health insurance benefits to which the recipient is entitled. Section 1404 does not in itself authorize an independent action to recover from a third party any monies paid to the recipient. Rather, the authorization to bring such a suit is contained in § 1409. Suits under § 1409 are limited by a five-year statute of limitations. As we have already noted, DPW concedes that five years has already passed.</p>
