Prior to trial, the government filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking the admission of the taped 911 call. The trial court granted the motion after a hearing. On appeal, Smith argues that the trial court erred in admitting the tape recording of the 911 call because it did not qualify for admission under either the spontaneous utterance or prior identification exception to the hearsay rule. Specifically, he contends that the circumstances surrounding the purported spontaneous utterance show conscious and reflective thought by the declarant and that the statement did not identify or describe appellant. We conclude that the admission of the taped 911 call, even if error, did not substantially sway the judgment; therefore, we affirm.</p>

As a result of Smith’s request for reconsideration, the trial court recalled Frederick to the stand in an effort to determine whether his excited state at the time of the 911 call was caused by the occurrence of the robbery or by his discussion with his mother. In response to the court’s questions, Frederick testified that he was initially reluctant to call the police, but his mother insisted. He said he was “very upset and angry” and was “real nervous” when he made the call because he had never been robbed at gunpoint. The trial court reaffirmed its original ruling, stating:</p>

As he walked on New Hampshire Avenue, he saw a small blue Chevette, which was “making a lot of noise,” with a broken side window covered with a black plastic bag. As Frederick continued walking, he lost sight of the car. He made a right turn onto Gallatin Street where he saw two men approaching from approximately fifteen feet away. One of the men, later identified as Smith, had a gun in his hand. As the two men approached closer, Smith cocked the gun. Smith’s companion “tried to take a punch at [Frederick],” but Frederick stepped back and punched the man instead. As Smith came toward Frederick with the gun in hand, he asked, “Hey, cuz, what’s up with the jacket?” At the time, Frederick was wearing a multicolored leather jacket with the number “44” on the back and the sleeves, which he had purchased just four days earlier. Frightened by the weapon, Frederick removed the jacket and threw it to the ground. Smith picked it up and told his companion to see if Frederick had any money in his pockets. Frederick emptied his pockets immediately, dropping his keys, cigarettes, ten dollars and some change in the process. Smith then told Frederick to walk away slowly. As Frederick complied, he heard Smith say, “I should shoot you,” but the second assailant told Smith not to. Fearing for his life, Frederick began running away in a “zigzag” pattern to avoid being shot. He took a circuitous route home to prevent the two assailants from following him home. During the robbery, Frederick had noticed the blue Chevette he had seen earlier parked in an alley nearby.</p>

When she opened the back door, he told her that he had just been robbed at gunpoint. His mother told him to call the police, but he was reluctant to do so. After arguing for approximately five to six minutes, Frederick called the police. The jury heard the tape of the 911 call, which had been the subject of the <em>in limine </em>motion. The police arrived approximately fifteen minutes after Frederick’s call. Frederick spoke to the' police for a half hour before they <a id="p1221" href="#p1221" data-label="1221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1221</a>drove him to the area where the robbery had occurred.

The fact that the complainant took a circuitous route home and had to be prodded by his mother to call the police are also factors which should be considered in the totality of the circumstances. Contrary to appellant’s claim, there is no indication that the trial court did not do so here. When appellant requested reconsideration of the court’s initial ruling to admit the recorded call, Frederick was recalled to the stand for the specific purpose of determining whether his excited state was caused by the shock of being robbed at gunpoint or by his discussion with his mother. The trial court credited Frederick’s testimony that he had never been robbed before and that he was upset and angry at the time by reason of these events. That Frederick took a circuitous route home does not vitiate the spontaneous character of the statement. He testified that he was frightened for his life and was afraid <a id="p1224" href="#p1224" data-label="1224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1224</a>that the gunman and his accomplice might púrsue him.

Whether an attorney has made a tactical choice is somewhat difficult to fathom in the first instance at the appellate level. Frequently, the question will require a factual determination.

On the record before us, we can not say that defense counsel’s failure to request that the trial court revisit the question of admissibility or move for a mistrial upon the government’s belated disclosure of the information after the tape had been played was a tactical choice which bars review except for plain error.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Appellant points out that the jury was unable to reach a verdict at one point and that one juror wanted to change her vote after the weekend.
