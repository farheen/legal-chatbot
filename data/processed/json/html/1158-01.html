The Act addresses not only expungement, but also sets out a body of rules describing the proper method of collection, retention and dissemination of criminal history records. Relying on specific provisions of the Act and its own enabling legislation, PennDOT makes the following argument: Expungement orders apply only to criminal history record <a id="p1162" href="#p1162" data-label="1162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1162</a>information. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 9122(a).

Criminal justice agencies are only those agencies whose principal function is to ad-. minister criminal justice. <em>Id. </em>PennDOT’s principal functions do not include the administration of criminal justice. 71 P.S. § 511.

    <p id="b1204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1204.4",1204,[197,914,755,592]]]'>¶ 11 The Department insists that because it does not fit within the definition of a criminal justice agency, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 9102, and is not listed as a criminal justice agency, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 9113, it cannot be required to comply with an ex-pungement order, particularly since the Act provides that notice of expungement be made only to those criminal justice agencies that have received criminal history record information. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 9122(d).</p>
    <p id="b1204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1204.5",1204,[193,1540,759,948]]]'>¶ 12 We do not agree. This case concerns a mandatory suspension of operating privileges ordered by the Chester County Court of Common Pleas. The suspension occurred as a result of criminal court proceedings and the suspension itself was triggered by an order of the criminal court. Thus, in this case, PennDOT acted at the behest of the criminal court. In essence, it operated as an arm of the court when it implemented the court’s order suspending M’s driver’s license for a period of eight months. The records the Department seeks to retain specifically relate to the criminal proceeding. Indeed, one of the documents is the notice sent to Penn-DOT from the court, setting forth the criminal code section violation and the terms of M’s ARD program.</p>

In that case, a driver was charged with DUI and, while in custody, refused to submit to a breath test under the state’s implied consent law, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1547(b). After his DUI charges were dismissed, the driver sought and was granted expungement of his criminal record. However, Penn-DOT later notified him that his license was suspended pursuant to § 1547(b).

This provision is necessary because the ARD rules permit expungement as soon as a participant completes the requirements of the program. Pa.R.Crim.P. 186. No ARD program can exceed two years in duration. Pa.R.Crim.P. 182. Thus, § 1534 serves to prevent an ARD-DUI participant from seeking expungement for a period of seven years after acceptance into the program. The purpose of § 1534 is clear: it prohibits an ARD-DUI participant from seeking expungement prior to the seven year period, despite his or her right, under the Rules of Criminal Procedure, to be granted expungement in advance of that date.</p>

For instance, the fact that the legislature authorizes the Department to promulgate rules regarding the maintenance and destruction of records, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S.A. § 6104(d), and the rules promulgated as a result of that authority, <em>see </em><a href="/citations/?q=67%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20207.1-207.4" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="67 Pa.

The Department argues that it must be permitted to retain ADR-DUI records indefinitely because it utilizes that information in determining the duration of a suspension based on accumulated points. The law explicitly requires the Department to consider ARD suspensions in this manner. 75 Pa.C.S.A § 1539(c).</p>

When points are reduced to zero for a period of twelve (12) months, any subsequent accumulation of points is regarded as initial points, thus erasing the previous accumulation. 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1537(b). These provisions lead us to <a id="p1166" href="#p1166" data-label="1166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1166</a>conclude that the General Assembly did not intend adverse driving records to last forever.

As noted above, § 1584(b) requires the Department to maintain an ARD record for seven years, even in the event of an expungement order. Other provisions in the law set forth similar rules. For example, the Code precludes PennDOT from issuing an occupational limited license to any person whose license was suspended pursuant to an ARD-DUI, <em>unless the suspension imposed has been fully served. </em>75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1553(d)(8) (emphasis supplied). The Code also precludes PennDOT from issuing a probationary license to any <em>person </em>granted an ARD-DUI <em>within the preceding seven years. </em>75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1554(f)(10) (emphasis supplied). And the Code likewise prohibits the Commonwealth from disposing of a DUI charge by way of ARD if the driver in question was accepted into ARD <em>within seven years of the date of the current offense. </em>75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3731(d)(1) (emphasis supplied).</p>

Rather, it is based on the reasonable expectations engendered by the ARD program itself. ARD carries with it the reward of expungement upon successful completion of the program. Pa. R.Crim.P. 186. The principal benefit accorded the defendant is elimination of his or her record. Only where the Commonwealth presents compelling reasons for the retention of a record is the court permitted to deny expungement. <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court believed that § 1534(b) allowed PennDOT to retain P-1 for seven years after the order of expungement was entered.

Pa.R.Crim.P. 182 (ARD programs shall not exceed two years duration). In this case, the record reflects that Penn-DOT was notified by the Chester County Clerk of Court of M’s acceptance into the ARD program sometime in February, 1984. Therefore, PennDOT was authorized, indeed required, to retain a record of that acceptance until February, 1991. Contrary to the trial court’s analysis, the statute does not mention the date of ex-pungement; it relies solely on the date PennDOT is notified of a driver’s acceptance into ARD. Because the seven-year term long has expired in this case, Penn-DOT is not authorized to retain P-1. That part of the trial court’s order must be vacated and this case remanded so that the trial court may direct PennDOT to expunge <em>all </em>records of M’s 1984 ARD-DUI participation, including P-1.</p>
