    <p id="b743-6" data-blocks='[["BL_743.7",743,[71,906,1328,445]]]'>The appellant, Dr. Lee De Forest, an internationally known scientist, inventor, and pioneer in the radio and talking picture industry, is the junior party, having filed his application, for patent at a date subsequent to the filing of the Owens application. It is admitted that Owens filed his application for patent while in Doctor De Forest’s •employ and without the knowledge of De Forest. It is, therefore, •earnestly contended by De Forest that Owens seeks to appropriate to his own use an invention which De Forest disclosed to him and which he, Owens, was employed to help perfect.</p>
    <p id="b743-7" data-blocks='[["BL_743.8",743,[73,1358,1328,698]]]'>It is admitted that De Forest on returning from Germany, where he had been engaged in the study of and experimentation in sound photography, brought back with him a) German motion-picture pointing machine which did not involve the subject matter of the invention, but which he proposed by reconstruction to utilize for the purpose of printing films for use in American projection machines such as the Simplex, where the distance between the picture opening and the sound opening was different from that of the corresponding openings of the camera. It was necessary to displace the •openings through which the picture and sound records were to be printed and to so arrange the mechanism that the film could be moved intermittently past the opening through which the pictures were to be printed and continuously past the openings through which the sound was to be printed.</p>
    <p id="b743-8" data-blocks='[["BL_743.9",743,[77,2065,1325,393]],["BL_744.1",744,[242,233,1319,387]]]'>Owens was an experienced camera man, but had no experience with sound on film photographs. Soon after De Forest arrived in this country he made inquiries for an experienced motion-picture •camera man. Owens was recommended and employed. Soon after Owens’s employment, the German printer arrived and was opened in the presence of Owens. De Forest states that he showed this continuous printer to Owens and explained what he had done with his first .printer in New York and later in Berlin, and just what <a id="p1426" href="#p1426" data-label="1426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1426</a>he proposed to do with this printer; that at once Owens understood what had to be done; that the printer was taken over to Jersey City where one Kaufman, a skilled mechanic, who had been in the employ of De Forest since 1913, was to build the machine. De Forest states that, in October, 1922, he fully instructed Kaufman and made a pencil sketch showing the nature of the machine to be constructed. De Forest says that Owens did not go to the Jersey City plant until some time thereafter.</p>
    <p id="b744-4" data-blocks='[["BL_744.4",744,[241,635,1320,595]]]'>The drawing, known as De Forest Exhibit 1, which is found on page 13 in a notebook, is the most important part of the evidence and is relied upon for corroboration by both parties. Kaufman says no one made any notes in that book except De Forest. Whether he meant the original sketch or the original sketch together with the notations made on the same, some of which were admittedly made later, he did not explain. De Forest admits, after stating that .the drawing was his, that certain words added to the drawing were not his and that the characters representing the take-up rolls were not his. Kaufman very positively states that he received no instructions from Owens as to the manner of building the machine, but that the idea was disclosed to him by De Forest.</p>
    <p id="b744-5" data-blocks='[["BL_744.5",744,[241,1237,1320,444]]]'>Owens testified, in effect, that he conceived the notion of how to bring about displacement between the sound and picture records immediately when De Forest showed him the German printer. When asked how he conceived this invention so quickly 'upon seeing the machine, he stated that anybody that was in the moving-picture business would have done practically the same thing. His further testimony is to the effect that whatever Kaufman did in the way of building the machine was done under his direction, and that he, Owens, not De Forest, made De Forest Exhibit 1.</p>

He testified that, in his opinion, De Forest’s Exhibit 1, the drawing which both parties claim to have made, was made by Owens. He first stated that De Forest, in making the representation of pulley wheels and similar circular parts, used a circle, and that he always began the circle below a line drawn horizontally through the center of the circle, while Owens invariably began his circles toward the top. On cross-examination <a id="p1427" href="#p1427" data-label="1427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1427</a>be was shown circles which De Forest drew in Exhibit 1 and elsewhere, which did not start in the bottom half of the circle, but toward the top.

    <p id="b745-9" data-blocks='[["BL_745.9",745,[64,1337,1318,748]]]'>It is conceded that if Owens made the invention, he made it while in the employ of De Forest and with the use of De Forest’s material. It is also admitted that Owens, while in De Forest’s employ, not only suggested that De Forest apply for a patent on this phase of the invention, but that he also should apply for a patent on the method of taking sound records in soundproof rooms. Owens’s notebooks show that fact to be true. It is conceded that at no time until after the controversy herein arose had Owens ever denied that De Forest was the inventor and entitled to the invention. When asked why he suggested to De Forest that he apply for a patent if he, Owens, was the inventor, he replied: “ I did not get next to myself until some time after.” When De Forest was asked why he did not file his application sooner, he stated that he did not have the remotest idea that one of his employees would be claiming the idea as his own invention and filing an application for a patent for the same.</p>

'On the contrary, the employee is to be protected from the rapacity of the employer, as much as the employer from the dishonesty of the employee; and if the employee makes an invention wholly independent of the employer, it is the law that the invention belongs to him who actually makes it, and that it does not inure to the benefit of the employer. What we hold is that when in the course of experiment by an employer with an invention a device is suggested for its improvement which in itself would reach the dignity of independent invention, and a dispute arises between employer and employee as to its conception, the presumption is justly in favor of the employer, and it is incumbent on the employee to overcome that presumption by satisfactory proof.</blockquote>
