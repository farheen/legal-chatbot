Two weeks after the 1998 filing, on August 8, 1998, appellee acknowledged paternity and entered into a verbal agreement with appellant for support.

In addition to the cash support paid, appellee permitted appellant to use an automobile titled in his name and for which appellee made car payments in the amount of $592 per month.

As stated, the defendant had previously paid support directly to the plaintiff. Moreover, the support case was filed as recently as January 4, 2000, and a hearing was conducted swiftly and an appropriate Support Order will be entered in a short period of time.

Michael Eakin. <em>Bowser v. Blom, </em><a href="/a2d/766/1259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="766 A.2d 1259" data-case-ids="11142262" data-case-paths="/a2d/766/1259-01">766 A.2d 1259</a> (Pa.Super.2001). On the question of the denial of counsel fees, Judge Eakin began by noting that there was no existing case law interpreting 23 Pa.C.S. § 4351(a), which authorizes a court to award fees incurred in paternity or support matters to the prevailing obligee as follows: “If an obligee prevails in a proceeding to establish paternity or to obtain a support order, the court may assess against the obligor filing fees, reasonable attorney fees and necessary travel and other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee’s witnesses.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Assessing the plain language of the statute, Judge Eakin reasoned that the statute did not mandate an award in every case where an order of support resulted. Indeed, in a case such as this where there was no denial of paternity or support, it would be difficult to say that the obligee “prevailed” in the proceedings. Similarly, it is unclear whether an obligee could be said to have prevailed in situations where the parties compromise or settle the matter, or in situations where the parties agree that support is due, but that there is some dispute as to the amount of support owing. Finally, Judge Eakin noted that the mere fact that an order of support results says nothing about the respective reasonableness of the litigation postures of the parties:</p>
    <blockquote id="b871-10" data-blocks='[["BL_871.12",871,[980,1564,716,699]]]'>[T]he posture of an obligee may be just as unwarranted [as the posture of an obligor], and this statute cannot force the potential obligor to accept an unreasonable demand on pain of being assessed the obligee’s counsel fees; agreement would be discouraged if the mere entry of an order triggered such an assessment. To award fees under subsection (a) just because an order results would penalize a parent whose cooperation and ongoing support of a child were antithetical to the need for significant legal expense in the first place.</blockquote>

Nothing in this section compels a court to award fees in a successful action to establish paternity or obtain support.</p>

The statute does not command an award of counsel fees in any instance, nor does it identify relative need as the exclusive, much less controlling, factor in determining when an award is appropriate. Moreover, appellant’s asserted standard would strip courts of the very discretion the statute plainly vests in them. Under appellant’s standard, an award of counsel fees would be required in virtually every successful child support action, with the obligor being required to pay the obligee’s counsel fees in the same percentage established for deter<a id="p836" href="#p836" data-label="836" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*836</a>mining an appropriate child support order. Thus, an obligor who earned 60% of the combined net monthly income of the parties would be responsible for 60% of the obligee’s counsel fees, regardless of the obligor’s conduct in the child support proceedings. While we acknowledge that appellant’s proposed standard would provide certainty, and reflects one self-contained and policy-based view of the question, it is not the policy or view that is commanded, or even suggested by, the actual discretionary language of § 4351(a). Since it is not this Court’s prerogative to ignore plain statutory language, we must reject appellant’s reading.</p>
    <p id="b874-4" data-blocks='[["BL_874.5",874,[192,1097,757,769]]]'>Although the statute makes the award of fees permissive and discretionary, rather than mandatory, the statute provides no specific guidance as to how that discretion should be exercised. Thus, the statute neither identifies relevant factors to be considered and balanced, nor does it exclude or minimize other factors. And so, this Court is called upon to articulate an appropriate standard for the exercise of the lower courts’ discretion. This is neither unusual, nor a great impediment for courts, which are well-versed in the formulation and application of such flexible, discretionary standards.</p>

We agree that unreasonable or obstreperous conduct on the part of the obligor in a child support action would warrant an award of counsel fees to the obligee. However, mounting a fair and reasonable defense in a child support action does not rise to the level of obstreperous or obstinate behavior and cannot be interpreted as unreasonably impeding the determination of paternity or an appropriate support order. In this case, appellant does not seriously impute such conduct to appellee.</p>
    <p id="b874-7" data-blocks='[["BL_874.8",874,[995,537,753,1013]]]'>However, we are not prepared to say that obstreperous or unreasonable conduct on the part of the obligor in paternity or support litigation is the only basis upon which an award of counsel fees would be appropriate. The statute certainly does not so confine the court’s discretion. Moreover, the very failure of the General Assembly to specifically address the circumstances which would warrant an award of counsel fees demonstrates that it contemplated some degree of flexibility in application — which perhaps is not surprising in an area where the facts of the cases are myriad and difficult to categorize, and where the overriding concern is the best interests of the child. Thus, it must be the totality of relevant circumstances that informs the determination of whether to award counsel fees.</p>
    <p id="b874-8" data-blocks='[["BL_874.9",874,[991,1590,754,1077]],["BL_875.1",875,[157,261,751,350]]]'>We need not imagine or account for all conceivable relevant circumstances, in addition to the conduct of the obligor in the litigation, in order to render some guidance on the standard. It is enough to say that we envision cases, for example, where the necessity of an action to secure support is unquestionable, and where the incomes of the parties is so disparate (with the obligor’s income exceeding that of the obligee), or where the obligee’s financial situation is so strained that the cost of the action would necessarily affect the child, that an award of counsel fees to the obligee would be appropriate or, in some instances, required. Thus, although we do not approve a strict needs-based model, the relative financial positions and financial needs of the parties certainly may be relevant. Similarly, the prior relationship of the parties, including the course of any <a id="p837" href="#p837" data-label="837" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*837</a>prior litigation between them and the conduct of the obligee, may have a bearing on the propriety of an award of counsel fees. As is usually the case in matters of discretion, where to strike the balance in weighing the relevant factors will be trusted, in the first instance, fairly to the trial judge.</p>
    <p id="b875-5" data-blocks='[["BL_875.6",875,[158,644,754,1690]]]'>Viewing the totality of the circumstances in the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is clear that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award counsel fees to appellant. This is not a situation where the father was shirking his moral and financial obligations, requiring legal action to force him to accept his responsibilities. To the contrary, appellee readily acknowledged paternity and accepted his paternal responsibility, which led to the original support agreement and the dismissal of appellant’s initial support action. The instant support action, moreover, was actually triggered when appellee filed a petition for special relief to open a new support case, in response to appellant’s attempt to have the U.S. Army divert appellee’s BAQ to her, as a form of additional child support, despite what the parties had agreed upon. As the Superior Court noted, appellee understandably viewed appellant’s action as an attempt to “double dip.” Appellant sought that additional support despite the parties’ agreement, and despite the fact that appellee had faithfully paid support according to that agreement — and in an amount that was equal to, and often exceeded, the amount ultimately fixed by the hearing officer upon appellant’s support complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Six days after appellee filed his petition, appellant filed her support complaint.</p>

Appellee did not deny — indeed, he has never denied- — his obligation of support. Moreover, this support action was fast-tracked due to appel-lee’s obligations to the military. Thus, the hearing officer conducted the hearing on appellant’s complaint approximately three weeks after its filing and less that one month after appellee had filed his petition for special relief. The hearing officer rendered his decision within three weeks of the hearing. In short, there was neither delay nor obstructive or obstreperous conduct on the part of appellee. Indeed, it was appellant’s own action in seeking ap-pellee’s BAQ as additional support, despite the parties’ agreement, that led to the litigation now before this Court. In this regard, it is important to note that the amount of support ultimately awarded was the very amount appellee had been voluntarily paying to appellant since the birth of their child, and approximately the same amount he received from the Army as his BAQ, which demonstrates that appellee’s defense in this support action was not unreasonable.</p>

But a blameless and responsible father/obligor such as appellee should not be required to finance the questionable decisions of the child’s mother, which inevitably led to this litigation. The fact that a support action was pursued at all in the case <em>sub judice </em>was due in the first instance to appellant’s conduct in attempting to obtain child support from the Army in an amount greater than that agreed upon <a id="p838" href="#p838" data-label="838" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*838</a>by the parties, and greater than that ultimately determined by the hearing officer and trial court to be appropriate. Bearing in mind appellee’s voluntary payment of an appropriate amount of child support from the time of the child’s birth, it would be fundamentally unfair to saddle him with appellant’s counsel fees, which were necessitated by her own conduct, and where there appears to be no financial burden upon appellant to bear her own legal costs.</p>

Basic Allowance for Quarters is a sum of money to which active duty military personnel are entitled when they do not live on post or in housing that is financed by the government. Soldiers who are eligible for BAQ and who have dependent family members are entitled to a greater amount of BAQ, which is referred to as "BAQ at the 'with dependents' rate." In order to be eligible to receive BAQ at the "with dependents” rate, soldiers must pay toward the support of their dependents, at a minimum, the difference between BAQ at the "with dependents” and "without dependents” rate each month. To procure BAQ, the service member must go to his local finance officer, establish that he does not live on the military base in assigned family quarters, submit proof that he has legal dependents, and request BAQ. If the father has an illegitimate child, paternity must be legally established before BAQ will be awarded. It was for the purpose of establishing that appel-lee was the father of this illegitimate child that appellant filed the original 1998 complaint.</p>
