The prior litigation required interpretation of the 1917 deed that partitioned the parcel currently owned by the Wentworths from the parcel currently owned by Sebra. The same strip of land that was the subject of the prior easement dispute is the subject of the current trespass claim, and, as the court pointed out, the Wentworths do not now offer any evidence that was not available to them during the prior litigation.
