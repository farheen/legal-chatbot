Because those motions raised certain factual issues which needed to be resolved, we referred the matter to a special master, the Honorable Leonard Braman, a retired judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Judge Braman was directed to hold hearings, to receive evidence, to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to recommend to this court whether respondent should be held in contempt. <em>In re Cummings, </em><a href="/a2d/471/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="471 A.2d 254" data-case-ids="7957937" data-case-paths="/a2d/471/0254-01">471 A.2d 254</a> (D.C.1984) <em>(Cummings II). </em>Judge Braman has completed .his hearings and filed a report containing his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations. On consideration of that report, we now grant the motions of the Board and Bar Counsel and hold respondent in contempt of court.</p>

    <p id="b522-15" data-blocks='[["BL_522.15",522,[1005,682,748,946]]]'>In <em>Cummings I </em>we granted the Board’s request for an audit of respondent’s financial records and made specific provision for him to claim his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination with respect to the audit. <em>See In re Malvin, </em><a href="/a2d/466/1220-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="466 A.2d 1220" data-case-ids="7986217" data-case-paths="/a2d/466/1220-01">466 A.2d 1220</a>, 1224 (D.C.1983). Respondent was directed to assert the privilege “within such reasonable time as the Board on Professional Responsibility may prescribe; otherwise the privilege shall be deemed to have been waived.” <em>Cummings I, supra, </em>466 A.2d at 1226. Respondent did not comply with the requirements set by the Board and its Executive Attorney<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> governing the time and manner for invoking the privilege. Judge Braman recommended that the privilege be deemed waived and that respondent be required to turn over to the Board all documents described in <em>Cummings I.</em>

His executing an authorization(s) (A) permitting the Board to remove forthwith from respondent’s office to its own offices all records, documents and materials set forth in <em>Cummings I, </em>or (B) permitting the auditor to inspect all such documents at respondent’s office. The Board shall elect in writing which alternative it chooses, the election to be filed with the Court .... Respondent shall perform all acts necessary, as the Board may require, to implement <em>Cummings I </em>and the terms of these recommendations, including without limitation, directing his agents, servants and employees to fully cooperate. In particular, Cynthia Behn, respondent’s bookkeeper, should be directed to cooperate. Respondent should further be directed to take no action which would impede or otherwise obstruct the procedures or objectives contemplated herein.</blockquote>

    <p id="b523-9" data-blocks='[["BL_523.7",523,[193,1859,747,515]]]'>Judge Braman also found that respondent violated a directive of the Executive Attorney. On September 26, 1983, the Executive Attorney asked respondent to submit certain information about his receipt and disbursement of client funds and fees following his temporary suspension. Respondent refused to provide such information. Judge Braman ruled that the request was “well within the power of the Board” under <em>Cummings I. </em>We agree.</p>

Therefore, Judge Braman recommended that if respondent fails to respond fully to the Executive Attorney’s directive within twenty-four hours after his release on the two conditions quoted above, he should again be incarcerated until he does comply. Judge Braman suggested that the Executive Attorney make available to respondent copies of any documents which the Board may have taken into its possession and which respondent may need in order to comply with <em>Cummings I.</em>

He was instructed three times to make specific claims of privilege on pain of waiver, and he refused to assert anything more than a general privilege with respect to all personal documents. This does not satisfy the requirements of <em>Cummings I. </em>In addition, we conclude that respondent is in contempt of this court’s order in <em>Cummings I </em>and of the Board’s orders and directives issued pursuant to the authority granted by that order. As we remarked in <em>Cummings II, </em>respondent has been “distinctly uncooperative in responding to [the Board’s] requests and orders.” <a href="/a2d/471/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="471 A.2d 254" data-case-ids="7957937" data-case-paths="/a2d/471/0254-01">471 A.2d at 255</a>. Judge Bra-man found that respondent has “thwarted virtually every effort of the Board to implement <em>Cummings I </em>or its mandate for urgency” and recommended that we impose sanctions “commensurate with this state of affairs ... [and] stern enough to move this case forward.” We wholeheartedly agree; the time has come to put a stop to respondent’s persistent sabotage of the disciplinary process.</p>

Petitioners have filed a motion to strike the affidavit, arguing that the information contained in it has not been subject to cross-examination and that it was not filed in accordance with the rules of the court. We grant the motion, but not on either of those grounds. The affidavit should have been submitted to the special master before he made his findings. Petitioners could then have raised their objections to it, and Judge Braman could have ruled on them as we authorized him to do in <em>Cummings II. </em>At this stage the affidavit comes too late.
