We sustain the finding that Boyd attempted to claim compensation under the Act when she orally informed AAI that she suffered from work-related stress and that she wished to take leave to recuperate. We cannot, however, sustain the final order of the Department because the Hearing and Appeals Examiner failed to indicate whether she placed the burden of proceeding on AAI after Boyd had presented a <em>prima facie </em>case or whether she placed the ultimate burden of persuasion on AAI. If the former, then the Examiner erred in ruling that AAI had failed to carry that burden; if the latter, the Examiner misallo-cated the burden.

In March of 1987, Boyd began to suffer from symptoms of stress, including sleeplessness and headaches, due to the work pressure of supervising a department that was understaffed as the result of a layoff and the resignations of three employees. Boyd sought treatment in July 1987 from Dr. <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>Yussef Akbari, her personal doctor, who referred her in mid-August 1987 to Dr. Barton Kraff, a psychiatrist, who treated her for depression. Boyd visited Dr. Kraff initially on August 21st, followed by psychotherapy sessions on August 24th and 27th and September 1st, 8th, and 14th. Dr. Kraff informed Boyd that her symptoms were work-related and recommended that she change jobs or take some time off. At the August 27th session, Dr. Kraff gave Boyd a letter to show to AAI documenting that she was being treated for depression with medication and psychotherapy. Upon returning to work that day, Boyd showed the letter to her supervisor Richard Dufek, told him that her depression was work-related, and requested time off. Dufek, however, persuaded Boyd not to take any time off. On that same day, Dufek requested another employee to calculate Boyd’s accrued leave, which showed 88.25 hours of vacation time available and 5.5 hours of sick leave available. At the end of the next day, August 28th, Dufek fired Boyd. Dufek told Boyd on August 31st that she was fired because of her bad attitude and poor management skills.</p>

Dufek testified that he noticed that Boyd had developed a bad attitude shortly after a non-work related injury in November 1986. Abramson testified that he thought Boyd’s attitude changed at about the time that he asked her to lay off one of the employees in her department. He, however, had difficulty remembering any specific incidents, did not remember receiving more or different complaints about Boyd than before, and did not remember who supervised Boyd during that period.</p>

An August 21st memorandum to Boyd from Du-fek reiterated that Boyd’s bad attitude was not justified by the pressure she was under and requested her to prepare a report by the end of the quarter comparing AAI’s word processing department to at least three other firms, to place an ad for a part time word processing employee, and to prepare a memorandum by August 27th outlining the strengths and weaknesses of the person whom she had assigned to be her backup.

The hearing examiner further noted the internal inconsistency between Abramson’s testimony that Boyd had an attitude problem and his inability to recall when it started or any specific manifestations of it, and also stated that Boyd’s personnel file made no mention of any problems. From the evidence presented, the hearing examiner determined that Boyd had shown that AAI’s decision to fire her was motivated by animus and that AAI had failed to meet “its burden of showing a non-retaliatory reason for the discharge” and had “not offered sufficient credible evidence to justify claimant’s termination.” The Director of DOES affirmed, and adopted and incorporated by <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>reference the compensation order of the Hearing and Appeals Examiner.</p>

    <p id="b618-9" data-blocks='[["BL_618.10",618,[1010,346,752,1292]]]'>It is frequently the case that the first step an employee takes in attempting to claim worker’s compensation is to report a work-related injury to his or her employer, and often that initial report will be oral. In fact, the Act requires that an employee notify his or her employer (as well as the Department of Employment Services) in writing of a work-related injury within thirty days of that injury, D.C.Code § 36-313(a)-(b) (1988), and then permits the employee to file a formal claim with the Department of Employment Services within a period of one year following the injury. D.C.Code § 36-314(a) (1988). An employee’s failure to notify her employer of a work-related injury in writing does not automatically preclude her from receiving worker’s compensation. The Act permits an employee to claim compensation even though she has failed to provide her employer written notice of her work-related injury “[i]f the employer ... had knowledge of the injury ... and its relationship to the employment and ... has not been prejudiced by failure to give such notice.” D.C.Code § 36-313(d)(l) (1988).</p>

It is unclear whether the hearing examiner meant that AAI had not met its burden of production (or proceeding) by failing to present evidence of a legitimate business reason for firing Boyd or that AAI had not carried the ultimate burden of persuading the examiner that it did not discharge Boyd for any retaliatory reason. “[T]he orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained.” <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm’n v.

Given that AAI had met its burden of proceeding, in order to succeed on her claim Boyd had to persuade the hearing examiner that AAI had fired her, wholly or in part, for pursuing her rights under the Act and not for the legitimate business reasons asserted by AAI; AAI did not have the ultimate burden of persuading the hearing examiner that it had not discharged Boyd for retaliatory reasons. Although there is substantial evidence to support the hearing examiner’s conclusion of retaliatory discharge, we cannot say without speculation that the hearing examiner imposed the burden of persuasion on Boyd rather than on AAI. Nor can we say, after reviewing the entire record, that the hearing examiner would necessarily have reached the same conclusion if she had imposed the burden of persuasion on Boyd.</p>
