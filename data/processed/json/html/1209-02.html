In Darlington, McKeon, Schuckers, and Brown, 1 Pennsylvania Appellate Practice Second Edition, § 313.2, it is observed that “[i]n light of the considerable amount of discretion involved in determining whether an order is a ‘collateral order’ for purposes of appeal under the collateral order doctrine, it is difficult to predict whether a particular order will be deemed to be appeal-able under the doctrine.” Although we cannot resolve all of the uncertainty in one fell swoop, this case allows us the opportunity to examine the contours of two of the factors.</p>

He identifies the question involved as whether the court abused its discretion in refusing to approve the settlement, and argues that review of this question will be irreparably lost if the litigation proceeds to final judgment.

      <em>National Recovery Systems </em>was a contract action. Although the defendant made an offer of settlement, the parties disagreed about the nature and effect of the plaintiffs response. The plaintiff asserted that the acceptance created a binding agreement and filed a motion to enforce the alleged settlement. The defendant argued that the acceptance was conditional, and thus no more than a counter-offer, which he had not accepted. The common pleas court agreed with the defendant and denied the plaintiffs motion to enforce settlement. Superior Court held that the order was not appealable under the collateral order doctrine. The court concluded that the plaintiffs claim about the validity of the settlement agreement would not be irreparably lost if immediate review were denied because it could be raised either on appeal from an adverse judgment in the underlying action or in a separate action. In either case, a determination that the settlement agreement was enforceable would entitle the plaintiff to damages caused by the defendant’s breach, including the expenses and other burdens incident to trying the ease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <em>Knisel </em>involved a wrongful death and survival action, as well as an underinsured motorist claim against an insurer. The parties ostensibly agreed to settle the bodily injury claims and the court approved the settlement, but the plaintiffs returned the check tendered by the insurer on account of a dispute over the effect of the release on the underinsured motorist claim. The insurer then filed a motion to enforce the settlement, which the court denied. The court also directed that its previous order approving the settlement “be held in abeyance” so as not to prejudice the plaintiffs’ underinsured motorist claim. Superior Court quashed the insurer’s appeal, likening the case to <em>National Recovery Systems. </em>The court observed that the ultimate fate of the settlement agreement was undetermined because the common pleas court had held it in abeyance. This analysis, however, failed to account for the fact that holding the settlement in abeyance was tantamount to rejecting the insurer’s interpretation of the settlement agreement, i.e., that the settlement barred the uninsured motorists claim. Nevertheless, even if the court had correctly recognized that the fate of the settlement agreement effectively had been determined against the appellant, as stated in <em>National Recovery Systems </em>the appellant’s interests could still be vindicated either on appeal from an adverse judgment or in a separate action. Thus <em>Knisel </em>is consistent with the rationale of <em>National Recovery Systems </em>even if the opinion did not fully articulate the application of its holding.</p>
    <p id="b1270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1270.6",1270,[195,1988,756,699]]]'>We have serious doubts, however, about whether the <em>Lanci </em>opinion accurately represented or applied the rationale of <em>National Recovery Systems </em>in reaching a different result based on different facts. That case arose out of an auto accident between Lanci and an uninsured driver. Lanci agreed to settle all claims with his insurer for $15,000, but later refused to accept the proceeds, asserting that the insurer had misrepresented this amount as the applicable policy limit, when in reality the limit was $250,000. The common pleas court denied the insurer’s motion to enforce the settlement, finding that it was based on a mutual mistake of fact.</p>
    <p id="b1270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1270.7",1270,[1001,253,753,1130]]]'>Superior Court held that the order was appealable under the collateral order doctrine. The court distinguished <em>National Recovery Systems </em>on the grounds that the result of the order denying enforcement in that case was that the matter would proceed to trial, whereas in <em>Lanci, </em>the matter would proceed to an uninsured motorist arbitration hearing. Given that the scope of appellate review from such a hearing would be limited to mistakes of law, the.court concluded that the insurer would lose any opportunity to appeal the court’s factual determination of mutual mistake. This conclusion, however, ignored the alternative means of vindicating the insurer’s- rights identified in <em>National Recovery Systems, </em>a separate action in the nature of breach of contract. Thus even if the court’s determination of mutual mistake would be unreviewable on appeal (a conclusion that is not beyond question), the insurer’s claim that Lanci should have been required to abide by the settlement would not have been irreparably lost.</p>

Whereas each of those cases involved one of the parties refusing to go forward with the settlement, in this case the settlement was not effectuated because of the court’s refusal to approve it. This is not analogous to a breach of contract. Indeed, by its terms the settlement agreement was nullified by the failure to obtain judicial approval. The interest asserted by the' Appellant is not his direct interest in the settlement itself, but that the court’s approval not be unreasonably withheld. The question of whether the court abused its discretion would indeed seem to be irretrievably lost if not reviewed immediately. This, however, is not the entire inquiry.</p>

Rather it must involve rights deeply rooted in public policy going beyond the particular litigation at hand. We note that Digital also raised the argument suggested by the Appellant here, that the right to avoid trial on account of a settlement agreement is important enough for immediate appeal because it advances the public policy favoring voluntary resolution of disputes. The Supreme Court tersely dismissed this contention by stating, “It defies common sense to' maintain that parties’ readiness to settle will be significantly dampened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a rule that a Y decision to let allegedly barred litigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of right only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiffs favor.” <a href="/us/511/0863-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="511 U.S. 863" data-case-ids="1146441" data-case-paths="/us/511/0863-01">511 U.S. at 881</a>, <a href="/us/511/0863-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="511 U.S. 863" data-case-ids="1146441" data-case-paths="/us/511/0863-01">114 S.Ct. at 1992</a>.

Under 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), Rule 312, and Chapter 13 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, permission to appeal may be sought on grounds that the order "involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and ... immediate appeal form the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter.” Although this procedure invokes the exercise of discretion by both the initial tribunal and the appellate court, absent a stringent interpretation of the definition of a collateral order, Rule 313 would produce the anomalous result of an appeal "as of right” which involves a "considerable amount of discretion” on the part of the appellate court alone.

Section (b) defines a collateral order as an order “separable from and collateral to the main cause of action where the right involved is too important to be denied review and the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claim will be irreparably lost.” Accordingly, under this rule an order must meet a three-prong test to qualify as a “collateral order;” separability, importance and urgency. <em>Ben v.

Accordingly, the majority focuses on the second prong of the three-part test, whether the right at issue is too important to be denied review, and finds that the claim stumbles on this factor. After consideration, the majority determines that, for purposes of defining an order under Rule 313, it is insufficient that the issue be important to the parties to the lawsuit but, rather, the issue must involve rights “deeply rooted in public policy”. The majority finds that only that type of claim “can be considered ‘too important to be denied review,’” and concludes that the instant matter involved no such claims.
