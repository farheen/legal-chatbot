The limited liability company (“LLC”) is a relatively new entity that has emerged in recent years as an attractive vehicle to facilitate business relationships and transactions. The wording and architecture of the Act is somewhat complicated, but it is designed to achieve what is seemingly a simple concept — to permit persons or entities (“members”) to join together in an environment of private ordering to form and operate the enterprise under an LLC agreement with tax benefits akin to a partnership and limited liability akin to the corporate form.</p>

Elf also argues that the court erred in failing to classify its claim as derivative on behalf of Malek LLC against Jaffari as manager.
