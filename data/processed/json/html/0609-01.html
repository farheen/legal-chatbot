He was required to furnish his own car to carry out his duties and in addition to an hourly wage, he was compensated for the travel mileage accrued during working hours. On December 31, 1982, Ad-Media reduced Snell’s working hours to three days a week. Snell, continued his employment until January 21, 1983, when his car became inoperable. Thereafter, he did not return to work.</p>
    <p id="b664-6" data-blocks='[["BL_664.8",664,[206,1067,751,791]]]'>A deputy Commissioner, finding that Snell left his employment voluntarily without good cause attributable to his employment, 26 M.R.S.A. § 1193(1)(A), temporarily disqualified him from receiving compensation. The appeal tribunal confirmed the deputy’s decision, and Snell appealed to the Commission. Snell contended that the economic impact of reduced hours and pay and car problems compelled him to “involuntarily leave his job with good cause attributable to his employment.” The Commission affirmed the decision of the appeal tribunal. The Superior Court, without opinion, reversed the Commission’s decision. The Commission now seeks review of that reversal.</p>

Snell did not claim that his act of leaving work was not a freely made affirmative choice but that it was motivated by the economic pressures of his circumstances. The sole issue then becomes did he have “good cause” within the meaning of 26 M.R.S.A. § 1193(1)(A) to leave his job. Snell had the burden to establish that good cause did, in fact, exist. Good cause must be measured against a standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances. <em>Kilmartin v. Maine Employment Security Commission, </em><a href="/a2d/446/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="446 A.2d 412" data-case-ids="7981005" data-case-paths="/a2d/446/0412-01">446 A.2d 412</a>, 414 (Me.1982). Snell’s contention is that the expense of providing a car as required by his employment and the reduction of work hours directly attributable to bis past unreliability in providing a car, should constitute good cause within the <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>meaning of section 1193(1)(A).

The Commission’s finding that the reduction of his hours was directly attributable to his unreliability for certain jobs handled by his employer owing to disrepair of his car was supported by the evidence. Although we have held that a substantial pay reduction may constitute good cause attributable to employment for leaving one’s job, we have done so only in the context of a unilateral reduction by an employer following an employee’s return to work after a layoff. <em>Boucher v. Maine Employment Security Commission, </em><a href="/a2d/464/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="464 A.2d 171" data-case-ids="7945573" data-case-paths="/a2d/464/0171-01">464 A.2d 171</a> (Me.1983). Snell’s contract of employment required he furnish his own car. The claimed personal economic inability to meet this condition after January 21, 1983, does not constitute good cause attributable to his employment for thereafter voluntarily leaving his job. The record supported the Commission’s finding that Snell’s automobile problems were personal and not related to his employment conditions. <em>See Kilmartin v.
