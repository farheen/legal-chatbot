Pew concludes that the trial court erred because the “three strikes” rule applies only to civil actions. (Pew’s Br. at 9.)</p>

Accordingly, neither Rule 108(b) nor <em>Bronson </em>can support Pew’s argument. Furthermore, under Section 6601 of the PLRA, criminal or habeas corpus proceedings are not subject to the “three strikes” rule when they <a id="p1219" href="#p1219" data-label="1219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1219</a>challenge the fact or duration of his confinement in prison. Here, however, Pew’s habeas corpus petition challenged the <em>conditions </em>of his confinement rather than the actual <em>fact or duration </em>of his confinement. Therefore, the habeas corpus exclusion articulated in Section 6601 of the PLRA does not apply to Pew’s case.</p>
    <p id="b1267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1267.5",1267,[167,686,754,603]]]'>Next, Pew argues that his habeas corpus petition is exempted from the “three strikes” rule because he has alleged that he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. Thus, he contends that Section 6602(f)(2) prevents the court from dismissing his request.
