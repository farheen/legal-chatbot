The trial justice, in his extensive review of the evidence, found that the defendant had been negligent in the maintenance of its floor. He further found that the plaintiff had also been negligent but not to the extent of having assumed the risk of injury under the circumstances of the case. Our review of the record indicates that the trial justice carried out his duties in accordance with the guidelines set forth in <em>Pisaturo v. Raso, </em><a href="/a2d/507/1357-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="507 A.2d 1357" data-case-ids="7904467" data-case-paths="/a2d/507/1357-01">507 A.2d 1357</a> (R.I.1986), and cases cited therein.
