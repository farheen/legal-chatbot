In August 2000, claimant successfully procured a full-time 40 hours/ week, $7.50/hour job with Spectaguard doing security work at the Park City Mall. In order to work during the day at a part-time job with the Lebanon County Sheriffs Department that subsequently became available, claimant cut back his hours with Spectaguard to the Friday and Saturday night shifts. The hourly rate for the County job is $9.05, with the possibility of overtime after working seven hours per day and double-time after working twelve hours per day. Claimant anticipated that the County would soon make him a full-time employee.</p>

After conducting a labor market survey, Robinson located three different positions with wages between $10-$13.00/hour. These positions were jobs as a surveillance technician, a community service aide for the City of Lancaster, and as a management trainee with a car rental agency. Robinson testified that these were the three highest paying positions that she found.</p>

At that time, she concluded that employer was not entitled to a modification of benefits on the basis of Robinson’s labor market survey because claimant found suitable employment on his own within his restrictions pursuant to the Notice of Ability to Return to Work. In addition, the WCJ noted that, given the fact that claimant was not given notice of the jobs found by Robinson until the first hearing in September of 2000, claimant did not have the duty to abandon his employment and seek out other positions. The Board affirmed and this court remanded for fact-findings as to claimant’s actual earnings and earning power.</p>

She chose that position because it was consistent with claimant’s interest in law enforcement and complimented the training he secured in the area of private investigation. Based on her selection, she thus concluded that claimant’s actual wages were not greater than his $455.60 earning power. The WCJ again, however, denied employer’s modification petition, based on her determination that claimant fulfilled the mandate of Section 306(b) by seeking and securing employment on his own which resulted in a modification of his benefits. The Board agreed with the WCJ’s determination, concluding as follows:</p>

He notes that he took the additional initiative of obtaining further training in the field of law enforcement and then securing employment in that field. Claimant thus concludes that employer should not be entitled to a further modification of benefits because it would be contrary to the public policy of encouraging claimants to initiate their own job searches and to rehabilitate themselves in preparation for a return to the work force.</p>

Here, although the WCJ properly considered claimant’s actual wages in determining his earning power, she ultimately accepted the expert’s evaluation by choosing one of the representative positions as indicative of what he could be earning.
