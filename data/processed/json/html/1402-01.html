    <p id="b721-11" data-blocks='[["BL_721.11",721,[64,1267,1320,499]]]'>Appellee’s petition for cancellation is based upon the alleged use by it and its predecessor in business, since prior to 1879, of a composite mark containing the words “ Herbs and Iron,” as applied to a medicinal preparation.

It is further alleged that the descriptive significance, if any, of the words “ Herbs and Iron ” became lost, due to long use by appellee, whereby a secondary meaning arose indicating origin of the goods to which the mark is applied in appellee.</p>

The mark, as shown in said registration, consists of the words “ W. H. Bull’s ” at the top, beneath which are the words “ Herbs and,” and between these words and the word “ Iron ” is a fanciful picture containing many features.</p>

    <p id="b722-4" data-blocks='[["BL_722.4",722,[257,391,1322,490]]]'>The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the words “ Herbs and Iron ” are descriptive in a primary sense, but that since appellee’s registration was granted under the 10-year •clauses of section 5 of said trade-mark act (its mark must be given the effect, both for the purpose of registration and in determining the question of the likelihood of confusion, of a valid trade-mark. The commissioner expressly found that appellee’s registration was duly made and was valid, and held that the two marks were confusingly similar, thus affirming the decision of the examiner of interferences.</p>
    <p id="b722-5" data-blocks='[["BL_722.5",722,[258,892,1318,196]]]'>It is apparent from the decision of the commissioner that he regarded the words “ Herbs and Iron ” as the essential feature of apxiellee’s mark, and for that reason held that the marks were •confusingly similar.</p>
    <p id="b722-6" data-blocks='[["BL_722.6",722,[257,1092,1320,495]]]'>We think the commissioner erred in holding that the words “ Herbs and Iron ” are the essential or dominant feature of appel-lee’s mark. In appellee’s application, upon which the registration was issued, it is stated that it adopted the mark “ for a medicinal preparation made from herbs and iron.” We think it apparent that these words were used in the mark solely to describe the goods, and that the essential and dominant features of the mark were the name “ W. PI. Bull’s ” and the pictorial representation. We may say, in passing, that the words “ Trade Mark ” are found in the oval containing the picture and above the word “ Iron.”</p>
    <p id="b722-7" data-blocks='[["BL_722.7",722,[256,1593,1318,442]]]'>The testimony shows that appellee manufactures a number of medicines in addition to “ W. H. Bull’s Plerbs and Iron,” among them <em>“ </em>Bull’s Liver Pills ” and “ Bull’s Oil Liniment.” If the contention of appellee is well founded, as held by the tribunals of the Patent Office, if appellee could establish 10 years’ exclusive use of “ Bull’s Liver Pills ” and “ Bull’s Oil Liniment ” prior to February <em>20, </em>1905, it could secure a monopoly of the words “ Liver Pills ” as a mark for medicine in pill form for liver diseases, and of the words “ Oil Liniment ” for any liniment containing oil.</p>
    <p id="b722-8" data-blocks='[["BL_722.8",722,[255,2041,1318,244]]]'>We have carefully examined the voluminous testimony in the case and it is clearly established that appellee never made a trademark use of the words “ Herbs and Iron,” standing alone, but its trade-mark use was always the words “W. H. Bull’s Herbs and Iron,” either with or without the pictorial representation.</p>

The testimony fairly establishes that retail customers <a id="p1405" href="#p1405" data-label="1405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1405</a>ordinarily called for either “ Bull’s Herbs and Iron ” or “ Spicer’s Nux Herbs and Iron.” The testimony shows that appellee’s representative w;ent to a number of drug stores and called for “ Herbs and Iron.” In some instances he was sold “ Spicer’s Nux Herbs and Iron,” in others he was asked if he wanted “ Spicer’s Herbs and Iron,” and in one instance he was asked whether he desired “ Spicer’s ” or “ Bull’s ” Herbs and Iron. It is the contention of appellee that this testimony shows confusion and that, because there was a greater profit to the druggist in selling “ Spicer’s Nux Herbs and Iron ” than in selling “ W. H. Bull’s Herbs and Iron,” druggists would palm off appellant’s goods for those of appellee. We think, however, that this does not constitute any proof of palming off or of deception. When a customer asked for a medicine as “ Herbs and Iron,” the druggist would understand him to make the inquiry in a descriptive sense, and the natural inquiry, where the druggist handled more than one such preparation, would be whether the customer desired “ Bull’s ” or “ Spicer’s ” or some other preparation of herbs and iron, of which there were a number on the market when the testimony herein was taken.</p>
    <p id="b723-3" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[71,1188,1317,195]]]'>We are of the opinion that appellee’s mark must be considered as a whole, and, so regarding it, there is no confusing similarity between it and the mark of appellant, and that the Commissioner of Patents erred in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b723-4" data-blocks='[["BL_723.5",723,[71,1390,1318,285]]]'>Appellee further contends that, regardless of any statutory right it may have by virtue of its registration, the testimony shows that it has established a secondary meaning of the words “ Herbs and Iron ” entitling it to the exclusive use of those words, and that appellant has not the right to use them in a descriptive sense or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.6",723,[73,1693,1316,141]]]'>It should be noted that appellant claims no exclusive right to the words “Herbs and Iron” apart from its mark, and has expressly disclaimed such words in its application.</p>

Congress has admitted to registration the names or terms belonging to the class under consideration simply because of their prior use as trade-marks, although they had not been such in law. Their exclusive use as trade-marks for the stated period was deemed in the judgment of Congress a sufficient assurance that they had acquired a secondary meaning as the designation of the origin or ownership of the merchandise to which they were affixed.

The law as to secondary meaning of marks was also fully discussed, and it was held that where a manufacturer establishes in a descriptive word a secondary meaning, as indicating his goods, he is entitled as against another to only such protection as will prevent such other from using that term to pass off his goods as those of the original appropriator.</p>
