The defendant, Lucien E. Forbes (defendant or Forbes), and Nicholas Grumprecht (Grum-precht) met unexpectedly during a Christmas 1996 fundraiser for their alma mater. In the course of exchanging pleasantries, Grumprecht, a commercial and investment banker of forty years and restaurateur, told defendant that he was looking for investors for a restaurant that he wanted to open. The defendant, chairman and chief executive officer of Rhode Island-based Forbes <em>&amp; </em>Company,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> described a business he was trying to establish off the coast of East Africa. Each man expressed interest in the other’s project, and they arranged to meet again to discuss their proposed ventures in more detail. Between December 1996 and March 1997, the two men met approximately twenty times at Forbes’s office to discuss defendant’s East African project. During the course of these meetings, defendant asked whether Grumprecht would help him develop his project. Grumprecht agreed. Forbes <em>&amp; </em>Company retained him as a financial consultant, but after only one month he was elevated to the position of chief operations officer for the company.</p>

The defendant told Grumprecht that because he had invested his salary into Forbes <em>&amp; </em>Company for business development, he did not have the money to pay his mortgage, and the Town of Tiverton had threatened a tax sale of his home because of outstanding real estate taxes. The defendant told Grumprecht that he needed $32,000 to avert financial disaster. After he determined, through inquiries of Forbes’s business partners, friends and acquaintances, that a loan of such a large sum to Forbes would not be a risk, Grum-precht, who had the money set aside for his restaurant project, agreed to lend the money to Forbes. However, Grumprecht made it clear to defendant that although he could lend him the money, he needed to be reimbursed in a short time to pay the contractors working on his restaurant. The defendant assured Grumprecht that he expected to receive a large sum of <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>money from Argentina and would be able to retire the loan in two weeks.</p>

Grum-precht then arranged a wire transfer of the loan proceeds to defendant’s bank. Although defendant used a portion of the loan to satisfy his personal debts, he actually invested most of the money in his company for development and expenses. In addition, defendant testified, two weeks after he received the loan, he used some of the funds for a ski vacation at Okemo Mountain in Ludlow, Vermont, with his wife and two children.</p>
    <p id="b681-6" data-blocks='[["BL_681.5",681,[184,1147,750,761]]]'>Approximately seven days before the due date for the note, Grumprecht discovered that defendant would be leaving on a business trip for Africa and asked Forbes to execute a postdated check for $32,000 as repayment of the loan. Forbes agreed and delivered the check on March 20,1997. The defendant assured Grumprecht that he could draw on the account on March 21, 1997, or, at the latest, on March 24, 1997. However, defendant requested that Grum-precht contact his assistant, Dan Brule (Brule), before he deposited the check to confirm that the account balance was sufficient to cover the check.</p>

On March 24, 1997, Grum-precht spoke to Brule and inquired whether he could deposit the check; Brule responded that the account lacked sufficient money to cover the amount of the check. For approximately six weeks thereafter, Grumprecht and Brule had at least ten conversations concerning the check, always with the same result. Grumprecht also managed to speak with defendant on three occasions during this same period. He told Forbes that he needed the money he was owed so he could pay for the construction of his restaurant, and that if Forbes did not repay the loan, he would be forced to borrow money himself. Each time, defendant told Grumprecht that he was still waiting to receive his commission from the land sale in Argentina that had not yet arrived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

At the close of the state’s case <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>and again at the close of the evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that having made Grum-precht aware that the check might not be honored upon presentment he lacked the specific intent to defraud Grumprecht, a defense to the charge based upon California law.
