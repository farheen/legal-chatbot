The tax is in lieu of a personal property tax on the vehicle and the proceeds are entirely retained by the municipality to be expended “for any purpose for which a municipality may appropriate money.” No person may proceed further with the registration process until this “excise tax” has been paid to the municipality. 36 M.R.S.A. §§ 1482, 1484, 1485, <em>1486, 1487 </em>

Armed with his “excise tax” or “personal property tax” receipt as the case may be, the applicant then registers his motor vehicle with the Secretary of State on payment (in the case of an ordinary passenger vehicle) of a fixed fee of $15. He is then issued a registration certificate and license plates to be attached to the vehicle. The proceeds derived from these registration fees are transmitted to the Treasurer of State. 29 M.R.S.A. §§ 55, 109, 110 and 242.</p>

The “excise tax” in question is clearly not itself an ad valorem property tax. As stated in the opinion the “tax is in lieu of a personal property tax on the vehicle.” 36 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1485. Most significant is the fact that the entire proceeds of the tax are added to the general revenues of towns and cities and in no way serve to enforce registration and licensing statutes. Our opinion should be viewed as holding only that the excise tax partakes of the nature of a property tax within the scope of the protection afforded by the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act but for all the other purposes the tax is and remains an excise tax on “the privilege of operating a motor vehicle upon the public ways.” 36 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1482(1) (c).</p>
