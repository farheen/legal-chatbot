    <p id="b808-27" data-blocks='[["BL_808.24",808,[1036,947,752,467]]]'>This matter came before a panel of the Supreme Court on December 21, 1993, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. In this case the defendant appealed from a Superior Court judgment for the plaintiff based on plaintiffs alleged false arrest and imprisonment by police personnel of the city of Providence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although it is arguable that some evidence was presented before the jury which was inappropriate, the trial justice’s instructions would appear to have overcome any prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b808-29" data-blocks='[["BL_808.26",808,[1034,1837,749,277]]]'>After careful review of the record the court is of the opinion that the other issues raised, the admission of evidence of reputation evidence, the trial justice’s instruction on probable cause and the instructions on damages do not disclose reversible error.</p>
