Lench appeal an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court) dismissing their land use appeal. The trial court affirmed the decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh (Board), which granted Eric DiLu-cente (DiLucente) a <em>de minimis </em>variance to increase the height of his home by four inches. Concluding that the trial court did not err, we affirm.</p>

The house is sited on land that slopes steeply upward from Pius Street; accordingly, the ground level at the rear of the house is twelve feet higher than at the front. The front wall of the first level of the house, facing Pius Street, is completely above ground, and the rear of the first level is completely underground.</p>
    <p id="b631-18" data-blocks='[["BL_631.19",631,[922,1774,756,809]]]'>DiLucente seeks to restore the house and to that end has developed a rehabilitation plan. The plan will replace the existing peaked roof and two gables with a flat roof, thereby creating more usable space on the top floor of the house. The plan would place a garage and entrance on the ground level facing Pius Street. The remaining three levels of the house will be devoted to living spaces. DiLueente’s new roof design will raise the overall height of the house by four inches, which exceeds the maximum allowable height. Accordingly, DiLucente applied for a dimensional variance to increase the height of the home.</p>

It also found that the proposed reconfiguration of the third story roof would not “affect the light and air of neighboring properties or adversely affect views.” R.R. 48a.

A four inch variance amounts to a .83 percent deviation from the ordinance’s 40 foot height restriction and a .79 percent deviation from the home’s existing height of 42 feet. Similarly, when measured from the Zoning Code’s 40 foot maximum height restriction the total deviation of two feet four inches, or 28 inches, amounts to a 5.82% variance. These measurements are consistent with our precedent on when a variance is appropriately determined to be <em>de minimis.</em>
