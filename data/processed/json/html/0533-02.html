    <p id="b587-23" data-blocks='[["BL_587.23",587,[936,948,755,1129]]]'>This disciplinary matter is before the Court pursuant to a motion of the Respondent, John A. Scungio, for Reconsideration and/or Rehearing. On December 12, 2000, the Respondent was disbarred from the practice of law after his felony conviction of one count of making materially false statements and representations to special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.), in violation of <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 1001">18 U.S.C. § 1001</a>. <em>In re Scungio, </em><a href="/a2d/762/1205-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="762 A.2d 1205" data-case-ids="11162799" data-case-paths="/a2d/762/1205-01">762 A.2d 1205</a> (R.I.2000). At the time Respondent was before this Court he had been sentenced to a three-year term of probation, with the first six months of probation to be served in home confinement; fined $40,000; and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment. We noted that Respondent had a pending appeal regarding the terms of his sentence only, and that the results of that appeal would not affect the validity of his conviction. <em>Id, </em>at 1205, Footnote 1.</p>
    <p id="b587-24" data-blocks='[["BL_587.24",587,[937,2111,752,246]]]'>On July 6, 2001 the First Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Respondent’s sentence and remanded the case for the imposition of a new sentence. <em>United States v.

After review of the submissions of the Respondent and the reply memorandum submitted by Disciplinary Counsel, we deem that Respondent’s motion lacks merit.</p>
