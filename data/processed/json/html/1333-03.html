    <p id="b1408-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1408.6",1408,[201,637,751,172]]]'>After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown.</p>

Indeed, this evidence was not disclosed to counsel for the defendant until the jury was about to be impaneled. Even though this failure to disclose was not deliberate, we believe that allowing the state to present this evidence virtually without warning placed the defense at a significant disadvantage which could not be cured by a continuance within the period of the trial. <em>See State v. Darcy, </em><a href="/a2d/442/0900-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="442 A.2d 900" data-case-ids="7973974" data-case-paths="/a2d/442/0900-01">442 A.2d 900</a> (R.I.1982). We further believe that this evidence was highly prejudicial to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b1408-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1408.9",1408,[1001,737,750,228]]]'>Consequently the defendantâ€™s appeal is hereby sustained. The judgment of conviction is vacated. The papers in the ease may be remanded to the Superior Court with directions to grant the defendant a new trial.</p>
