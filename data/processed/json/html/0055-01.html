Irrespective of the June 29, 1989 order appellant subsequently filed another petition to modify support on August 25,1989, in which he sought a reduction in child support due to his significantly decreased income. At a hearing conducted on December 7,1989, the court determined that appellant was bound by the terms set forth in the June 29, 1989 order, and concluded that his child support obligation could not be reduced irrespective of his change of circumstances.</p>

Appellant contended that enforcement through contempt abrogated the agreement which was reached by the parties and which was incorporated in the June 29, 1989 order. In response, he filed another petition to vacate the arrears. A hearing was held on November 5,1992.

Appellant argues that the contract bar to downward modification of support is employed wrongly in relation to support provisions. If support may be modified upward, he asserts, then support also should be permitted to be modified downward. Moreover, if support is based on the needs of the child, support should be governed by that criterion. As a result, child support in agreements should be subject to modification based on childrens’ needs, rather than employing needs of the child as an exception to contract law only for the purpose of increasing support.</p>
    <p id="b115-8" data-blocks='[["BL_115.6",115,[978,223,756,613]]]'>Appellant further contends that it is unconscionable that the court recognize the unfortunate circumstances of his reduced income in light of his support obligation, yet permit no remedy. He notes that his level of support from the support guidelines would equal $624.56 per month, but the court has ordered him to pay $1,168 per month plus $100 in arrearages. He claims this is confiscatory. In support of this argument, appellant cites the dissent in <em>Bell v. Bell, </em><a href="/pa-super/390/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="390 Pa.

That is, support obligations are generally modifiable upon a showing of changed circumstances. If parties sit down to negotiate an appropriate sum for support why is it automatically assumed that they wish to change the modifiable nature of the obligation? Isn’t it more likely that they have the same generally accepted concept of support in mind and are merely negotiating an acceptable support obligation rather than accepting the risk of an adverse award by the court, or perhaps, are attempting to limit the litigation costs, which, as we are all aware, can amount to substantial sums rather quickly.</blockquote>

      <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>We reject appellant’s arguments. First, the non-modifiability aspect of the agreement between the parties with regard to support was entered with their consent as part of a court order. They bargained for non-modifiability for a specified limited period of time. We agree with the trial court’s conclusion that appellant specifically bargained for the non-modifiability of support at the June 29, 1989 hearing, perhaps on the assumption that his income would rise with self-employment. Moreover, it is beyond argument that, absent legally relevant distinctions of fact, we are bound by precedent. <em>Aivazoglou v. Drever Furnaces, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="418 Pa.

Thus, applicable precedent dictates that we hold that appellant is bound by his prior agreement that the amount of his child support may not be modified based on changed income or circumstances.</p>

This is not the case when a party seeks a decrease in breach of their prior commitment due to reduced income. Further, with respect to appellant’s equal rights argument, it may be noted that the obligor equally likely may be the woman today as a man.</p>

It patently is clear that the support provision in the agreement constitutes the level below which support may not be modified. Courts have general authority to modify their own support orders based upon changed circumstances. However, this does not permit modification below the level of support set forth in the agreement of the parties where the court has incorporated that agreement as part of its support order. The support obligation set forth in the agreement is an independent financial obligation between the parties. <em>Sonder v. Sonder, </em><a href="/pa-super/378/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="378 Pa. Super. 474" data-case-ids="706192" data-case-paths="/pa-super/378/0474-01">378 Pa.Super. 474</a>, <a href="/pa-super/378/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="378 Pa.

Support may be modified upward based on the unavoidable obligation which a parent owes to meet the reasonable needs of a dependent child, but this rationale does not extend to downward modification of the level of support set forth in parties’ agreement once the court has adopted their agreement. <em><a href="/pa-super/378/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="378 Pa.
