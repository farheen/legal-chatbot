Each of the counts calls for a tubular structure and it is not clear'how such a form could be used'in making steps. It is time'that Fernandez indicates (XQ’s. 110'and 111) that the form was tubular but he'does-not explain how it was used, beyond indicating that the steps weré arc shaped.-.vlt seems likely that the forms were merely arcuate rather than ¡completely tubular. In any ease, there is no corroborating witness who testifies that the forms were tubular. Mrs. G-regoricli, the only witness with first-hand knowledge,' who noticed the forms says that they were like exhibit G, which is perfectly flat.' It 'seems most unlikely that she would have made such a statemen-C if they--Had been tubular.
