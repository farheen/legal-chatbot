About thirty six cubic centimeters of water was collected from the reaction mixture, corresponding to the theoretical amount of water expected if the reaction proceeded as planned. The product, identified by the code PNC-U93431 <em>L-2 </em>in Exhibit 7, was sent by Fang to Schwarzkopf Microanalytical Laboratory, an independent commercial laboratory, for a determination of the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the sample. The results, attested to by Drs. Otto and Francine Schwarzkopf, were consistent with the theoretical percentages of those elements in HESO. We may take the preparation of HESO as proved.

It is stated in Exhibit 16 that “The hydroxyl content of this sample is in the same range as other samples submitted in this series (p-107, 108) according to I. R. analysis R. M. Z.” The pages 107 and 108 appear as Exhibits 14 and 15. Gould testified that R. M. Z. were the initials of the analyst who reported the I. R. analysis. Page 108 of the notebook (Exhibit 15) includes a similar statement as to hydroxyl content and refers to page 107 (Exhibit 14). Exhibit 14 states as an objective “To determine purity of 5-methylol-5 ethyl-2-methyl-2-ethyl-l,3dioxane” and includes the statement “No starting material (1,1,1-trimethylol propane) can be detected in the sample by I.R. analysis.”</blockquote>

R. analysis in Exhibit 14 clearly shows that the sample did not contain hydroxyl groups and the necessary conclusion is that the sample analyzed did not contain either the starting hydroxy compound nor the hydroxy-containing compound named at the top of the exhibit. It is to be noted that Exhibit 14 does not include any statement that the material is free from all hydroxy containing compounds. It is Stated only that no 1,1,1-trimethylol propane, the starting material, can be detected by the I. R. analysis. In our opinion this statement cannot be construed to mean that <em>no </em>hydroxyl group is present when the objective was to determine the purity of a compound stated to have a methylol (a hydroxyl containing) group. We find no basis for concluding that none of the compound named in Exhibit 14 was present. Since Exhibit 16 indicates that the hydroxyl content of the sample of PRCE-19149 is “in the same range as” the sample of Exhibit 14 (stated to be a hydroxyl containing 1,3- dioxane compound) we agree with Hankins <em>et al. </em>that the logical conclusion would be that the sample of Exhibit 16 contains hydroxyl groups to substantially the same extent as the hydroxy compound of Exhibit 14.

Fang also testified that, before he would make a suggestion that subject matter be patented, “I have to remain convinced that an idea is a worthwhile suggestion before I make such a proposal.” At best, the earliest suggestion to patent the present subject matter was made after Hankins filing date. That is at least some indication, we think, that Fang did not regard the present subject matter “worthwhile” until that time, and that he did not have a conviction of success based on the evidence of record, particularly Exhibits 36, 38 and 40.
