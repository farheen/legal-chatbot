In January 2008, King initiated legal action against the Riverwateh Condominium Owners Association (Association) seeking reimbursement for costs he expended to replace and jack up a defective horizontal steel beam in the roof of the garage located in the lowest level of his four-story condominium unit. As a result of a successful arbitration of the matter, King was awarded the sum of $3,577.93. Following the Association’s subsequent petition for injunction and appeal from the arbitration award, the trial court conducted a non-jury trial. Ultimately, the court entered a June 21, 2010 verdict/judgment in favor of the Association and against King in the amount of $8,500.17 and sent courtesy copies to both attorneys. The <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>docket entries reflect that the verdict/judgment was filed on June 21, 2010.</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[207,415,750,661]]]'>Counsel for King alleges that he first learned of the verdict on June 22nd from the courtesy copy and, on that basis, filed a July 2, 2010 motion for post-trial relief. The Association responded with a preliminary objection seeking to have the post-trial motion stricken as untimely filed, which the court sustained on July 28, 2010 pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 227.1(c)(2) requiring post-trial motions to be filed within ten days after “the filing of the decision in the case of a trial without jury.”</p>

In any event, the trial court stated that King’s delay in entering his appearance resulted in the OJS sending copies of orders or judgments only to counsel for the Association and to King himself in accordance with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 236(a)(2), which provides as follows:</p>

Further, the court considered the fact that counsel never represented that King himself did not receive any notices of orders or judgments. The court, therefore, concluded as follows:</p>

Prac. (2d ed.), Procedural Rules § 227.1(c):6 (2005).

Specifically, he cites the OJS’s failure to send him notices of any orders or judgments in compliance with Rule 236 and failure to enter his name and address into its docketing system even after he included his name, address and attorney identification number on all of his pleadings in compliance with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 1025. Further, he maintains that the trial court erred in determining that its courtesy copy of the verdict/judgment constituted proper notice in that there is no exception to the requirement that the prothonotary provide counsel with written notice of the entry of a verdict/judgment. <em>Dreher Twp.

Based thereon, it argues that counsel for King failed to prove that he did not get notice of the entry of the verdict/judgment in accordance with the OJS’s standard Rule 236 procedure. Further, it maintains that counsel for King offered no evidence of a breakdown in the court system at the hearing on the petition for rule to show cause, conceding that he received a courtesy copy from the court the day after the verdict/judgment was issued. In that regard, it contends that counsel in all due diligence should have checked the record if he believed that he did not receive a copy from the OJS in a timely manner. In addition, it maintains that the Rule 236 notations on the docket pre-dating the June 21st entry of verdict/judgment should have put counsel on notice of any issues with notice well in advance of the case’s conclusion. Finally, it notes the trial court’s determination that counsel for King did not receive notice of the verdict/judgment from the OJS due to his failure to enter his appearance in a timely manner, which was his own fault.</p>
