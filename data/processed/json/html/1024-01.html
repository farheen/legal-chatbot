It is lacking in many qualities desirable for commercial articles, particularly in that it is affected by temperature variations, when cooled becoming more brittle and harder, and when heated becoming soft and plastic. It was early discovered that by incorporating sulphur with rubber and by heating the mixture at a relatively high temperature (286° F. or higher) and for a relatively long time, its properties were favorably changed,, in so far as its elasticity, tensile strength, and other desirable properties were greatly increased. It was then not affected, as above indicated, by temperature changes and was not soluble in organic solvents. This was early styled “ vulcanization ” or “ curing.” The amount of sulphur in a rubber compound is comparatively small: From 2 to 10 parts of sulphur to 100 parts of rubber. It was later discovered that by the addition of certain inorganic substances to the rubber and sulphur, the time and temperature required' to produce vulcanization were considerably decreased, and in more recent years it was also discovered that certain organic substances known as high power or low temper atare curing accelerators, when mixed with the compound, further reduced the' <a id="p1027" href="#p1027" data-label="1027" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1027</a>time and temperature required for vulcanization. The use.of these accelerators, however, was fraught with danger and inconvenience since the low temperature at which and the quickness with which the vulcanization or curing was brought about by the accelerator caused frequent burning in the mill.</p>
    <p id="b477-3" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[64,483,1324,650]]]'>The milling consisted of taking the crude rubber which was tough and almost inelastic though somewhat flexible and incorporating with it the other compounding ingredients and “ breaking it down ” or working it into a plastic condition by running it through a mill consisting of rolls. During the milling operation it was squeezed, mixed, kneaded, pulled apart and stretched until the mass became plastic and its original nature almost completely changed. The rolls of a standard mixing mill are about 5 feet long and 2 feet in diameter and handle in one operation a batch of rubber weighing about 150 pounds. The operation requires approximately 40 to 50 minutes. The friction generated in the mill raises the temperature of the compound to approximately 200° F. After this compound has been mixed, it is usually placed in the stock room of the factory.</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[66,1137,1326,544]]]'>■ When it is needed for manufacturing purposes a sufficient amount is taken from the stock room and warmed up in the mill substantially in the manner in which it was mixed. It is then taken to a calendering machine and run between two heated rolls accurately spaced apart to produce a sheet of the thickness desired. Rubber blanks are then cut from the sheet. The scrap from this operation is put back with the original batch. Up to this point it will be seen that it is very important that the material will not “ set up ” or that incipient vulcanization should not have occurred. To vulcanize such a stock requires a period of three or four hours and a temperature of approximately 270° to 300° F.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[67,1689,1328,743]],["BL_478.1",478,[259,224,1322,243]]]'>. The high power accelerators were well known in the art when the parties hereto made their respective inventions. Both recognized that there was a great advantage in the use of high-power accelerators in so far as very rapid vulcanization would result from the use thereof and thereby yield a vulcanized product having an exceedingly high tensile strength and other very valuable physical characteristics. These powerful accelerators, it is admitted, will coact with sulphur at a temperature materially below the melting point and even below the temperature commonly obtained by the compound in the mixing mills and calenders. Because the powerful accelerators would effect vulcanization in the presence of sulphur below the temperature which the compound reached in the milling, warming up and calendering operations, no great field of usefulness appeared for' them. How to use them to advantage in vulcanization was the problem of the inventors herein. The problem was solved by both parties in <a id="p1028" href="#p1028" data-label="1028" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1028</a>an exceedingly simple way and solved so completely as to obviate all difficulty in the use of the high-power accelerators. The solution rested in the recognition of the fact that sulphur will migrate at a low temperature and also that certain of the accelerators would also migrate at a low temperature.</p>

In one would be the sulphur and other ingredients <em>without </em>the high-power accelerator. In the other would be rubber and other ingredients <em>with </em>the high-power accelerator. They could be produced and kept in stock indefinitely. To form a sheet or slab of rubber, the two plies were taken from stock and one superimposed upon the other, or a great number of plies might be put together. The sulphur would migrate into the plies containing the high-power accelerator and the high-power accelerator would migrate into the plies containing the sulphur and curing or vulcanization would then take place.</p>

The migratory nature of the accelerator caused it to enter the rubber compound and curing or vulcanization then took place.</p>

The fact of a successful “ cure ” for practical purposes is established by a simple and short method called the thumb and tooth test. By this test, rubber chemists settle the fact and determine by the resulting product the satisfactory quality of the stock or the mix for vulcanization and they become expert at it. If by this test the product is not well united chemically, it is said to be “ under cured ” or “ over cured,” and then the operator changes the ingredients or the time of the process. When it is important to determine with greater exactness the tensile strength, and degree of elasticity or other qualities of the product, a special machine measure or test is used, hut the thumb and tooth test is the frequently used way of knowing a cure and it is a satisfactory one for every day use in business.</blockquote>

    <p id="b481-8" data-blocks='[["BL_481.9",481,[80,2130,1325,350]]]'>Curtis, assistant to C. E. Bradley, director of the general laboratories of the U. S. Rubber Co., produced a printer’s roll, or what appears to be a part of one, Exhibit 89, formed from alternate plies containing C. P. B. and aniline which involved the mixing and calendering of a comparatively large amount of rubber. Curtis, testified that the stock cured well and was very satisfactory. The board again said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b482-3" data-blocks='[["BL_482.3",482,[234,225,1321,911]]]'>
      <a id="p1032" href="#p1032" data-label="1032" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1032</a>No one contends that either of these stocks would burn in the mill and it is admitted that sulphur and C. P. B. will migrate. This exhibit 89 clearly embodies counts 1 to 6, inclusive, of the issue, and we see no reason why reduction to practice is not established by the work done on Exhibits 14, 40, 34, and 89, all of which was prior to Harrison and Morton’s reduction to practice of these counts on November 11, 1920. The examiner of interferences denied Oadwell a reduction to practice on the grounds that he worked almost entirely on small quantities of rubber and that the method could not be properly tested out without milling batches of 100 pounds or more in a commercial mill instead of in a small laboratory mill, and he further held that tests by stretching, prodding with a lead pencil, etc., were not sufficient. Exhibits 34 and 89 required the handling of considerable amounts of rubber, as admitted by the examiner of interferences, but he held that these exhibits were not tested. At least, they showed that the composition used could be ■milled in large batches without burning, and the fact that they were well cured is testified to by men who should have known. No specific tests are described, but an experienced rubber man can determine by inspection and handling whether rubber is properly vulcanized, and presumably and inevitably, Curtis and Barrett made these ordinary tests such as are described in connection with other articles, see Steinle,.Q. 74„ pages 681, XQ. 212, page 722, Oadwell, page 371, XQ. 736, before forming the conclusion that the rubber was properly vulcanized.</blockquote>

    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[231,1336,1322,846]]]'>Cadwell testified that about July 1, 1920, he prepared a stock containing rubber, zinc oxide, lithopone, sulphur and C. P. B. which was wound into a roll about 2 inches in diameter and placed in a closed receptacle which contained aniline. The stock was allowed to stand in this receptacle for about six weeks or more and from time to time was examined to determine how far the aniline had penetrated into the rubber. As it penetrated the stock, the rubber was vulcanized. It was better cured in the center than on the surface. It was tested by prodding it with a lead pencil and by inspection. The testimony of Oadwell was corroborated by Steinle. The rejection of the examiner of interferences was based upon the quantity of rubber used. The board concluded that the examiner of interferences did not take into consideration the proposition that this established clearly that C. P. B. is migratory and that if it was, the same formula and process could be used on commercial quantities without scorching or burning in the rolls. We agree with the board as to the weight to be given this testimony.</p>

B. and sulphur which was calendered in sheet form, rolled about a mandrel, and painted with aniline. The tube was removed <a id="p1033" href="#p1033" data-label="1033" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1033</a>from the mandrel, inflated with gas and water, and heated. This exhibit was made September 24,1920. The board found that it was well vulcanized and cited <em>Nikaido </em>v. Bruni, <em>supra. </em>Bradley supported the testimony of Coe.</p>
    <p id="b483-3" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[119,422,1324,600]]]'>There are many other exhibits which have been discussed and to which objections have been made, among them a finished slipper. It is not necessary for us to discuss them since we are certain that sufficient tests were made on these many exhibits to prove conclusively that proper vulcanization would result from the migrations of the various ingredients. That none of these tests found their way into the finished commercial product for many months does not argue that there was no reduction to practice. These operations took place in the laboratories of a large and responsible rubber concern. Much time was spent, and we think properly so, in determining the different kinds of articles which could be most suitably and profitably made by the use of the new process.</p>
    <p id="b483-4" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[121,1028,1324,644]]]'>The record shows that appellee’s rubber which was vulcanized by the process here in dispute was tested in the usual way for determining proper vulcanization, and which test was in common use in the rubber laboratories of the country. It was tested by the thumb and pencil method and by the stretching method. These tests were sufficient to prove conclusively the character of vulcanization attained. If laboratory tests and laboratory construction of inventions were to be rejected in cases of this kind, it would seem to us that it would lead to very grave consequences for future inventions. It may be that there are in the field of invention certain articles in which laboratory tests and laboratory manufacturing would hardly be regarded as a reduction to practice, but we do not think vulcanization of rubber can be placed in that class.</p>
    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.6",483,[121,1680,1322,750]]]'>Some of the articles in controversy here were stretched on stretching machines to determine the resistance to strain; some of them were stretched to determine flexibility and tensile strength. It would seem that it would be very difficult to apply a machine flexibility test to a finished slipper or other finished commercial article, and certainly it is not required that the slipper should be worn for a certain length of time, in order to constitute reduction to practice of vulcanization of the rubber contained therein. True enough, those who contemplate great expenditures in manufacturing establishments and equipment ofttimes apply many different tests in order to determine the commercial expediency of wholesale manufacture, but because this is a practice among careful and responsible manufacturers, it does not follow that such a practice is the measure by which the patent tribunals should determine the question of reduction to practice in a case like that at bar.</p>
    <p id="b484-2" data-blocks='[["BL_484.3",484,[205,243,1326,1000]]]'>
      <a id="p1034" href="#p1034" data-label="1034" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1034</a>In conclusion we think it sufficient to say that the invention in this case does not lie in the invention of a rubber slipper or other-finished similar commercial articles. The invention claimed is for a process of vulcanizing rubber. The lack of factory tests and the failure to engage in wholesale commercial manufacture and other suggestions of appellants’ able counsel might, under some circumstances, be considered by a court in order to test the credibility of' witnesses or to determine whether a litigant really did the things-he claimed to do. It might also have weight on the question of abandonment. In this case there is not the slightest insinuation that one litigant knew anything about the cqierations of the other during the period of investigation, testing, etc. The experimental plants were far removed from each other. The high standing and scientific attainments of appelle’s witnesses is not questioned and their testimony is of the kind which is difficult to fabricate. It is of the character that imports verity. No abandonment is shown by this record. As to all the counts, appellee was first to conceive, first to reduce to practice, and first to file in the Patent Office. His diligence, argued at length in the briefs, is, therefore, beside the question.</p>
    <p id="b484-3" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[204,1252,1323,142]]]'>The board correctly reversed the examiner of interferences and awarded priority of invention to the appellee, and its decision is <em>affirmed.</em>
