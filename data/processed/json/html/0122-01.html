    <p id="b160-21" data-blocks='[["BL_160.19",160,[994,1123,750,185]]]'>Appellant was found by a jury to have committed the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 29 M.R.S.A. § 1312.</p>
    <p id="b160-22" data-blocks='[["BL_160.20",160,[995,1342,747,136]]]'>Seasonably thereafter he filed a motion for judgment of acquittal. From the denial of this motion, this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b160-23" data-blocks='[["BL_160.21",160,[1031,1513,338,37]]]'>We deny the appeal.</p>
    <p id="b160-24" data-blocks='[["BL_160.22",160,[990,1587,750,326]]]'>Stated succinctly, the appellant argues the jury was wrong in accepting the testimony of the witnesses called by the State and rejecting those whom he called. The Court, he says, should have corrected the “error” by granting his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>
    <p id="b160-25" data-blocks='[["BL_160.23",160,[991,1962,746,86]]]'>As we view the evidence, a pure question of fact was presented.</p>
    <p id="b160-26" data-blocks='[["BL_160.24",160,[987,2089,749,328]]]'>The appellant arrived in Presque Isle, Maine, the evening of his arrest after a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, on a commercial air line. He says he was served two drinks of V.O. whiskey and water enroute. These drinks had 1J4 or <em>I1/2 </em>ounces of whiskey each.</p>
    <p id="b160-27" data-blocks='[["BL_160.25",160,[984,2454,749,231]],["BL_161.1",161,[186,245,751,181]]]'>Just before leaving Boston, he took pills prescribed for him by a physician to calm his nerves. The quantity was “two yellow ones and one white one.” No further description of the two yellow pills and the <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>one white pill is found in his testimony. However, a physician called by the defendant later identified the two yellow pills as valium and the one white pill as equanil.</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[185,464,752,280]]]'>The combination of the medication and the intoxicating whiskey ingested by the appellant, the jury was told by the physician, would produce the same effect as if the appellant had ingested twice as much alcoholic whiskey.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[182,798,754,465]]]'>When one is charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he operated the motor vehicle, and that his faculties were impaired at the time by intoxicating liquor, whether the driver is influenced or affected by intoxicating liquor alone or by the combination of liquor and other substances is immaterial.</p>
