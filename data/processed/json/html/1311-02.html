The defendant was also accused of a number of charges of breaking and entering with accompanying larcenies and three incidents of arson, which took place between April 28, and June 24, 1987.</p>

She left her place of employment and met defendant at a gas station in Woonsocket. The defendant had been drinking and was extremely upset to the point of dissolving into tears. He ultimately stated to Laliberte that he was the sniper for whom the police had been searching and that he was also responsible for the wave of breaking and entering and arsons.</p>

Trepanier declined to return to his home and report these facts to his parents, and after much discussion he and Laliberte decided to go to the Woonsocket police station. The time of their arrival at the police station was approximately 1 a.m. on October 8,1987. The two attempted to get the attention of Patrolman Walter Warot, who was typing at a desk behind a counter that separated the public from the outer office. At first the patrolman did not respond to their efforts, but Trepanier caught his attention by saying, “I’m the one you are looking for. I’m the sniper.”</p>

There he made a series of oral and written statements, some of which implicated Duc-harme. The statements made at the State Police Barracks were suppressed pursuant to pretrial motions. However, a statement made by Trepanier to Patrolman Warot was not suppressed. In this statement defendant told Warot that a rifle he had used in the sniper incidents had been disposed of in Stump Pond across from the Smithfield police station. Thereafter, the police recovered a rifle from the spot described and caused the gun to be examined by an expert employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Special Agent Robert W. Sibert testified that a number of the bullets found at the scenes of the sniper incidents came from the same gun. He further testified that although these bullets had characteristics consistent with the rifle, he was not certain whether the bullets had come from the rifle retrieved in Stump Pond because of its rusted condition. Agent Si-bert advanced the opinion that the rifle had <a id="p1314" href="#p1314" data-label="1314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1314</a>probably been in the pond from nine to twelve months.</p>

The defendant asserts further that the trial justice requested that defense counsel discuss this offer with his client at the Adult Correctional Institutions. During the ensuing weekend counsel consulted with defendant and his family and reported on Monday morning that defendant would accept the offer of a twenty-five-year sentence. The trial justice had previously agreed that a twenty-five-year sentence would be appropriate. However, the prosecutor responded that the offer that she had made was only tentative and that her superior would not accept a plea on these terms. Apparently the head of the criminal-justice division, James Ryan, would not agree to any plea proposal that would involve a sentence of less than thirty years. As a result the plea negotiations ended, and the trial proceeded.</p>

Applying a due process analysis, the Court found no fundamental unfairness in the withdrawal by the State of Arkansas of the prosecutor’s proposed recommendation of a sentence of twenty-one years to be served concurrently with sentences then being served by defendant Johnson.</p>

      <a id="p1315" href="#p1315" data-label="1315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1315</a>Nevertheless defendant argues that in our supervisory capacity we should require the state to carry out a plea agreement to which its representative had apparently agreed, although she later claimed that she did not have authority from her superior to do so. In response to this argument we decline to extend our supervisory authority to require the state specifically to perform such an agreement. We believe that either the state or a defendant may withdraw from such an agreement unless and until that defendant’s plea is actually entered. Prior to that time such an agreement should not be enforceable against either party. It is notable that under the holding in <em>Santobello v. New York, </em><a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">404 U.S. 257</a>, <a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">92 S.Ct. 495</a>, <a href="/us/404/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="404 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="6172366" data-case-paths="/us/404/0257-01">30 L.Ed.2d 427</a> (1971), the Supreme Court did not require specific performance even after a plea had been entered but allowed the prosecution in the alternative either to keep the promise or to allow the plea to be withdrawn. The defendant cites numerous cases in which courts have held that a plea agreement may be specifically enforced even before the plea is entered. We find these cases unpersuasive. We are persuaded by the opinions of those courts that have held that no enforceable agreement has been made until the plea is entered. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

We have stated on numerous occasions that the appropriate procedure for challenging an improper or illegal sentence is to seek a revision of that sentence initially in the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Once the agreement is made, the offense is complete. <em>State v. Barton, </em><a href="/a2d/427/1311-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="427 A.2d 1311" data-case-ids="8003656" data-case-paths="/a2d/427/1311-01">427 A.2d 1311</a>, 1312-13 (R.I.1981). Although a common agreement is the keystone of any criminal conspiracy, the terms of such an agreement are often difficult to prove. Consequently, the conspirators’ goals may be inferentially established by proof of the relations, conduct, circumstances, and actions of the parties. <em>State v. Ahmadjian, </em><a href="/a2d/438/1070-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="438 A.2d 1070" data-case-ids="7999189" data-case-paths="/a2d/438/1070-01">438 A.2d 1070</a>, 1084-85 (R.I.1981); <em>State v.

There is utterly no evidence in this case of a single conspiracy of a type that often exists when individuals engage in a rational though illegal criminal enterprise that involves multiple distinct overt acts. Such is often the case when one or more persons engage in drug dealing as in <em>United States v.
