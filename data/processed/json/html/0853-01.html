Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause to a juror and by denying his motion to discharge pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 600. We affirm.</p>

A preliminary hearing listed for September 30, 2003 was continued to October 7, 2003 because the victim, who was chief witness for the Commonwealth, was still being hospitalized for the stab wounds he received from Appellant. On October 7, 2003, the preliminary hearing was again continued, this time to November 19, 2003, because the victim had not yet been discharged from the hospital. On November 19, 2003, the charges were held for court.</p>
    <p id="b911-12" data-blocks='[["BL_911.12",911,[946,695,755,1027]]]'>¶ 3 The quarterly sessions report of Appellant’s December 10, 2003 arraignment notes that no discovery took place at that time and that a pretrial date of January 12, 2004 was set. The report for January 12,2004 notes a continuance to January 26, 2004 on “defense request,” with an additional notation that the “judge [was] not sitting.” On January 26, 2004, the court ordered a scheduling conference for February 9, 2004, and that reciprocal discovery was due within 30 days. On February 9, 2004, the report lists that the defense required additional discovery, which the Commonwealth agreed to provide, and that the Commonwealth requested the earliest possible date — June 14, 2004 — for what it anticipated would be a three-day jury trial. The court also granted the Commonwealth’s motion for DNA testing.</p>

On June 14, 2004, the Commonwealth requested a continuance as it still awaited DNA test results. The court set a new earliest possible trial date of September 16, 2004. After the court granted Appellant’s July 16, 2004 Rule 600(e) motion for nominal bail, the September 9, 2004 report shows a defense request for a continuance because a defense witness would be on vacation on the scheduled trial date. The court rescheduled trial from September 16, 2004 to the earliest possible date, November 1, 2004, and the time was ruled excludable. In a subsequent September 24, 2004 quarter session entry <a id="p856" href="#p856" data-label="856" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*856</a>where the court granted a Commonwealth motion to revoke Appellant’s bail, there is a notation that the court ordered the quarter sessions file to reflect that the Commonwealth was in fact ready to try the case on September 16, 2004.</p>

On November 8, 2004, defense counsel was ill, a new trial date of November 22, 2004 was set, and time was ruled excludable. On November 22, 2004, the prosecutor was granted a continuance because, just ten hours before trial was set to commence, he learned that the Philadelphia Department of Health ordered his son’s daycare center closed for the 22nd due to a suspected case of meningitis in one of the children enrolled there, and he could not possibly arrange substitute daycare on such short notice. To accommodate both another criminal case slated for that courtroom and the three-day holiday week, the court set a new trial date of November 29, 2004, which was one day before the adjusted run date applicable to Appellant’s case. On November 29, 2004, however, the other criminal trial had not yet concluded, so on the prosecutor’s suggestion Appellant’s case was reassigned to a new judge to expedite trial, and a new trial date of December 6, 2004 was set. Time was ruled excludable.</p>

Though it agreed that the case was, in fact, six days past the run date, the court denied Appellant’s motion, ruling that the six day delay was <em>de minimis </em>and that “the record is entirely [devoid of] any lack of due diligence on the part of the Commonwealth in this case.” - N.T. 12/06/04 at 16.</p>

The trial court opined that the chances that trial in the other case would actually begin tomorrow were “nonexistent,” and then verified with the prospective juror that there was no other problem that would prevent him from serving as a fair and impartial juror in this case. N.T. 12/06/04 at 73.</p>
    <p id="b912-8" data-blocks='[["BL_912.8",912,[1027,1118,752,1336]]]'>¶ 8 In objecting primarily that the scheduling conflict presented a genuine hardship, counsel for Appellant stressed the imprudence of delaying the other case just so its chief witness could sit as a juror in the present case. Counsel also voiced a secondary objection that there may be a “legal issue” because the juror was “working with the Commonwealth on [the other case].” “I know you can be fair and impartial, no doubt about that[ ]” counsel said to the prospective juror, “... but the thing is during the time you are working with [the prosecutor’s] colleagues, ... [you are working] as a team.” N.T. 12/06/04 at 76. To this point, the trial court confirmed with the prospective juror that he had not dealt with the prosecutor in this case and could be fair and impartial here. N.T. 12/06/07 at 77. Counsel for Appellant devoted the remainder of his lengthy hardship objection to the scheduling conflict at hand, which the court rejected. Juror Number 9, therefore, served on Appellant’s jury, which convicted Appellant as noted <em>supra.</em>

The crux of Appellant’s Rule <a id="p857" href="#p857" data-label="857" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*857</a>600 challenge is that the Commonwealth could not show due diligence where it failed to establish that it had a case tracking system in place that would have enabled it to avoid a rule violation and ensure that the case was heard several days earlier:</p>

Rule 600 serves two equally important functions: (1) the protection of the accused’s speedy trial rights, and (2) the protection of society. In determining whether an accused’s right to a speedy trial has been violated, consideration must be given to society’s right to effective prosecution of criminal cases, both to restrain those guilty of crime and to deter those contemplating it. However, the administrative mandate of Rule 600 was not designed to insulate the criminally accused from good faith prosecution delayed through no fault of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>

In addressing the issue of due diligence, Appellant does not point to any particular delay along the 365 day timeline as representing a due diligence failure. Rather, he contends, due diligence cannot have been found where the Commonwealth never established its use of an appropriate case-tracking system to provide meaningful and timely warning about upcoming Rule 600 deadlines so as to meet those deadlines where possible. We disagree, for this case simply does not present as one where the Commonwealth “lost track” of where the case stood with respect to the Rule 600 run date. To the contrary, the delays encountered during the pendency of the case would have occurred with the best case tracking system in place, and, in any respect, the record shows both the Commonwealth and the trial court were cognizant of the approaching run date months in advance.</p>

Indeed, such a wide sweeping standard would automatically disqualify prospective jurors simply because they carried out their civic duty of complying with a witness subpoena. We decline to adopt such a standard.</p>
    <p id="b916-7" data-blocks='[["BL_916.7",916,[1027,399,751,766]]]'>¶ 24 Without any particularized evidence that the juror either exhibited a prosecuto-rial bias during his involvement with the other case or developed one because of it, we cannot presume a likelihood of prejudice in the juror. Here, the juror alleged hardship only because of the potential scheduling conflict between cases; to the court’s question regarding his relationship with the prosecutor’s office in the other case, the juror confirmed he had not dealt with the prosecutor in this case and could be fair and impartial here. The trial court, therefore, committed no abuse of discretion for not dismissing the juror.</p>

We further note that where, as here, the Commonwealth was prepared to begin trial prior to the adjusted run date and trial was rescheduled within thirty days after that run date, the delay does not seriously implicate the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial so as to require dismissal under Rule 600. <em>See Commonwealth v.
