Perlsweig against respondent PFPC Worldwide, Inc. The petitioners seek appraisal of the value of the shares and options they owned in PFPC before it was merged with an acquisition vehicle of PFPC’s indirect parent, PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., in a short-form merger under 8 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 253 in which PFPC was the surviving entity. Both of the petitioners were PFPC executives before the merger.</p>

The petitioners argue that the equities demand recognition of such a right. In support of that contention, the petitioners have filed affidavits suggesting that PFPC failed to provide the petitioners with adequate information or otherwise make fair provisions for the petitioners to convert their options into stock before the effective time of the merger, despite the <a id="p1233" href="#p1233" data-label="1233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1233</a>fact that the relevant option agreements provided that the petitioners’ options would vest upon the occurrence of a change of control, including a § 253 merger. For example, the petitioners have provided evidence to demonstrate that the PFPC board did not undertake a fair valuation process for the options but simply imposed a take-it-or-leave-it value on the petitioners in an offer that required them to waive a host of legal rights.</p>
    <p id="b1281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1281.5",1281,[80,882,754,663]]]'>Without contesting in this action that the petitioners might have equitable or contractual claims regarding the treatment of their options, the respondent PFPC has moved for partial summary judgment advancing a simple proposition: § 262 is a limited statutory remedy that is available only to stockholders.

In this case, for example, the petitioners have advanced arguments that, if true, might well constitute a breach of the relevant option agreements. In a breach-of-contract action, the petitioners would be free to show that they were deprived of their options (or of their contractual rights of vesting and conversion) in violation of their contractual rights. A fitting remedy for such a breach might well be an award of damages that equals a judicial assessment of the fair value of the options that the petitioners lost.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In this sense, the petitioners would have access to what in some equitable corporate cases is referred to as a “quasi-appraisal” award of damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Importantly, that type of case might well involve claims against parties other than the surviving corporation, which is the only proper respondent to a § 262 action. In fact, the petitioners have brought just this type of action against PFPC and other parties in this court and that action has also been assigned to me for resolution.</p>

The petitioners argue, however, that they “would have” exercised the options before the merger had PFPC provided certain requested information, and that PFPC “treated” the options as stock in various ways during the transaction. This argument, however, is precisely the kind of breach-of-duty question that has no place in a statutory appraisal, and that must be raised in a separate plenary action. The petitioners cite no relevant authority for the proposition that equitable breach-of-duty claims may be raised in an appraisal proceeding,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and I decline to interpret § 262 to permit consideration of issues unrelated to the appraisal of the fair value of actual stock.

To the extent that the petitioners are able to prove a breach of contract or fiduciary duty, the remedy might well be one in the nature of an appraisal determination. After hearing from the parties to this action and the separate plenary action, the court might also conclude that the actions should be consolidated for many or all purposes.

The petitioners cite various cases in their surreply brief for the proposition that it is necessary in an appraisal proceeding to determine what stock is validly at issue in the appraisal. Without quibbling with that statement, I note that these cases do not support the proposition that equity may require this court to ignore the simple fact that petitioners are seeking appraisal for options, not stock. Indeed, in all of the cases cited by petitioners that involve appraisal proceedings, the petitioners actually held, in some form or another, shares of stock for which appraisal was being sought. <em>See Salomon Bros.
