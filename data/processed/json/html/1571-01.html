    <p id="b900-3" data-blocks='[["BL_900.4",900,[218,330,1324,845]]]'>The second requirement of <em>res judicata </em>is identity of issues. If the second action between the same parties or privies is upon the same claim or demand, the judgment in the prior action operates as an absolute bar to relitiga/tion not only of those matters actually determined in the prior suit but also any other matter which might have been acted upon in the prior suit. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>County of Sac, </em><a href="/us/94/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="94 U.S. 351" data-case-ids="5646801" data-case-paths="/us/94/0351-01">94 U.S. 351</a>. This aspect of the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>sometimes called <em>res judicata </em>by bar or merger, differs from the second aspect of <em>res judicata, </em>estoppel by judgment. If the second action is upon a different claim or demand, an estoppel by judgment, more limited in its scope than <em>res judicata </em>by bar, operates as an estoppel only as to those matters upon which a determination or final verdict was actually rendered. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>County of Sac, <a href="/us/94/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="94 U.S. 351" data-case-ids="5646801" data-case-paths="/us/94/0351-01">supra.</a> </em>Because the distinction between <em>res judicata </em>by bar and estoppel by judgment is often a source of confusion, the definitive statements of the Supreme Court in <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Sunnen, <a href="/us/333/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="333 U.S. 591" data-case-ids="6158777" data-case-paths="/us/333/0591-01">supra,</a> </em>at pages 597-598, are here quoted at some length:</p>
    <blockquote id="b900-4" data-blocks='[["BL_900.5",900,[219,1200,1322,408]]]'>It is first necessary to understand something of the recognized meaning and scope of <em>res judicata, </em>a doctrine judicial in origin. The general rule of <em>res judicata </em>applies to repetitious suits involving the same cause of action. It is rests upon considerations of economy of judicial time and public policy favoring the establishment of certainty in legal relations. The rule provides that when a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final judgment on the merits of a cause of action, the parties to the suit and their privies are thereafter bound “not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.” * * *</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b900-5" data-blocks='[["BL_900.6",900,[220,1616,1325,656]]]'>But where the second action between the same parties is upon a different cause or demand, the principle of <em>res judicata </em>is applied much more narrowly.

Since the cause of action involved in the second proceeding is not swallowed by the judgment in the prior suit, the parties are free to litigate points which were not at issue in the first proceeding, even though such points might have been tendered and decided at that time. But matters which were actually litigated and determined in the first proceeding cannot later be relitigated. Once a party has fought out a matter in litigation with the other party, he cannot later renew that duel. Jn this sense, <em>res judicata </em>is usually and more accurately referred to as estoppel by judgment, or collateral estoppel. * * *</blockquote>

Some such further indication, it seems to us, should have been given to enable readers of the application to understand how the product is to be used. If the specification had indicated a particular use for the <em>film, </em>and if the question before us was whether the language used was sufficient to explain this use to one skilled in the art, then testimony of experts might well have been received. But the present specification, while indicating useful properties of the new polymers (heat and acid resistance), makes no such statement as to the film, or explains how the film is to be uesd.
