The court initially noted that the mere existence of a strike or other industrial controversy does not necessarily preclude a finding of misconduct. However, the court noted that in disputes arising out of private contractual agreements a finding of misconduct would require the resolution of factual issues as well as complicated questions of labor law, and that <a id="p750" href="#p750" data-label="750" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*750</a>such matters “are best left to agencies especially qualified to deal with them, namely the Federal and State Labor Boards and labor arbitrators,” rather than the individuals administering the unemployment-compensation laws. <em>Id. </em>at 7, <a href="/citations/?q=224%20N.E.2d%2072" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="224 N.E.2d 72">224 N.E.2d at 75-76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20N.Y.S.2d%20633" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="277 N.Y.S.2d 633">277 N.Y.S.2d at 638</a>.

In <em>Rodriguez, </em>a hospital employee participated in a strike that had been expressly declared unlawful by statute because of the need to protect the public from the disruption of essential services in the area of health and hospital administration. The court noted that the traditional reluctance of the Legislature to intervene in the realm of employment relations was overridden in this case by a compelling need to ensure the public safety in the critical area of health care. Given this imperative legislative purpose, the <em>Rodriguez </em>court held that violation of the statutory mandate prohibiting strikes amounted to “legislatively defined” misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 582, <a href="/citations/?q=300%20N.E.2d%20418" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="300 N.E.2d 418">300 N.E.2d at 419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=347%20N.Y.S.2d%2043" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="347 N.Y.S.2d 43">347 N.Y.S.2d at 45</a>. Unlike violations of a private collective-bargaining agreement, the legislation prohibiting strikes involved no complex issues of labor law because “the Legislature itself resolved all such issues by explictly proscribing and expressly stamping as unlawful strikes and work stoppages by * * * public employees * * <em>Id. </em>at 582, <a href="/citations/?q=300%20N.E.2d%20418" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="300 N.E.2d 418">300 N.E.2d at 420</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=347%20N.Y.S.2d%2043" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="347 N.Y.S.2d 43">347 N.Y.S.2d at 46</a>.
