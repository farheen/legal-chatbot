AMI seeks to recover from Cozy Harbor taxes that AMI paid to the State on two refrigerator trucks acquired by AMI and leased by AMI to Cozy Harbor. AMI contends that the tax liability arose when AMI leased the trucks to Cozy Harbor, not, as Cozy Harbor contends, when AMI purchased the trucks. AMI further contends that pursuant to the lease agreement, Cozy Harbor has assumed the burden of paying the tax assessed. We agree with AMI, and we vacate the judgment.</p>

      <a id="p920" href="#p920" data-label="920" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*920</a>[¶ 13] The characterization of a TRAC lease as a retail sale is important to the result in this litigation. First, it indicates that AMI did not incur tax liability when it purchased the vehicles, even if the purchase had occurred in Maine because Maine’s sales tax does not apply to sales of tangible property when the buyer intends to resell the property. <em>See </em>36 M.R.S.A. § 1752(11) (Supp.1999) (stating that a “retail sale” does not include sales where the purchaser intends to resell the property); 36 M.R.S.A. § 1811 (Supp.1999) (stating that sales tax applies to “all tangible personal property ... sold at retail in this State”). AMI’s purchase of the vehicles was for the purpose of leasing them to Cozy Harbor under the TRAC lease. Because the State treats TRAC leases as sales for tax purposes, AMI’s real purpose was to “sell” the vehicles at retail. Thus, AMI incurred no tax liability on the purchase.</p>
    <p id="b960-4" data-blocks='[["BL_960.6",960,[203,1396,749,641]],["BL_960.7",960,[1006,233,747,137]]]'>[¶ 14] Second, if AMI had entered into a bona fide or traditional lease with Cozy Harbor, then it would have incurred “use tax” liability because it would have been using (i.e. leasing) property within the state. <em>See </em>36 M.R.S.A. § 1861 (Supp.1999). Because the TRAC lease is considered a sale, however, AMI did not use the vehicles in Maine and was not subject to a use tax. <em>See id.; see also </em>36 M.R.S.A. § 1758 (1990) (charging use tax only if the property bought for resale is leased before it is resold). Instead, it is Cozy Harbor who is liable for the sales tax arising from its “purchase” of the vehicles from AMI. <em>See </em>36 M.R.S.A. § 1753 (1990).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Cozy Harbor agreed in paragraph nine “to pay all taxes, fees, costs and expenses in connection with the use, operation, maintenance, repair, licensing, registration and titling of each Vehicle.” The agreement further provided that “it is the intent of the parties that ... all costs and obligations of any kind relating to a Vehicle, whether or not specifically set forth in this Lease, shall be the responsibility of and paid for by [Cozy Harbor].” The Superior Court erroneously concluded that the tax paid by AMI was not on the TRAC lease but rather was assessed on AMI’s purchase of the vehicles in Massachusetts, and it construed paragraph nine as not obligating Cozy Harbor to reimburse AMI.</p>

We held in <em>Hannaford </em>that a lease requiring Hannaford to take title to vehicles at the expiration of the lease term fell squarely within the Bureau of Taxation’s definition of a lease "in lieu of purchase” and was properly treated as a sale. <em>See Hannaford Bros., Co., </em><a href="/a2d/487/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="487 A.2d 251" data-case-ids="7912908" data-case-paths="/a2d/487/0251-01">487 A.2d at 255</a>; <em>see also </em>Me.
