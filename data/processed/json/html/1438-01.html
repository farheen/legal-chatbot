An appeal was taken to the Board of Appeals<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which affirmed both grounds of rejection by a decision dated June 30, 1964. The present application was filed before the termination of proceedings on the first application since it was filed before the time to appeal had expired. In the refiled application now before us, the specification was modified by setting forth quotations from published articles which had been incorporated in the first application only by reference. The claims were substantially changed by the insertion of limitations which had not appeared in the claims of the first application, although in <a id="p1440" href="#p1440" data-label="1440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1440</a>some respects tlie new claims were broader. The new application contains an affidavit of Dr. George PI. Dorion on the issue of insufficient disclosure in which he states that the disclosure in both of appellants’ applications was adequate to enable him to practice the invention. By reason of one or more of these three changes — in the specification, in the claims, and in the evidence of record — appellants contend that the <em>res judicata </em>rejection was not proper.</p>

(BNA) 130">156 USPQ 130</a> (Dec. 14, 1967, rehearing denied Feb. 15, 1968). The board, therefore, was unaware of our views on the law as therein set forth. Notwithstanding consideration of the <em>Herr </em>case by the Patent Office Solicitor in his brief, filed Feb. 13,1968, he relies in that brief on <em>In re </em>Prutton, <a href="/ccpa/40-2/0975-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="40 C.C.P.A. 975" data-case-ids="6079943" data-case-paths="/ccpa/40-2/0975-01">40 CCPA 975</a>, <a href="/f2d/204/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="204 F.2d 291" data-case-ids="1267989,6079943" data-case-paths="/f2d/204/0291-01,/ccpa/40-2/0975-01">204 F.2d 291</a>, <a href="/ccpa/40-2/0975-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="40 C.C.P.A. 975" data-case-ids="6079943" data-case-paths="/ccpa/40-2/0975-01">97 USPQ 447</a> (1953). The solicitor says, in fact, “the decision in Prutton is controlling.” In <em>Herr, </em>the opinion of the Chief Judge did not discuss <em>Prutton </em>though it refers to it in a footnote in quoting from the board. In the concurring opinion of the writer, however, <em>Prutton </em>was considered <em>in extenso </em>and it was stated as his view that the court reached the wrong conclusion in that case, that it should be overruled (<a href="/ccpa/54-2/1315-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="54 C.C.P.A. 1315" data-case-ids="6086741" data-case-paths="/ccpa/54-2/1315-01">54 CCPA at 1321</a>, 153 USPQ at 551), and that he would overrule it and considered that by implication the Chief Judge’s opinion did so (CCPA at 1326, USPQ at 554). The late Judge Smith, in his concurring opinion in Herr, said (CCPA at 1335, USPQ at 560) :</p>

    <blockquote id="b804-8" data-blocks='[["BL_804.8",804,[267,2097,1252,114]]]'>The instant <em>res judicata </em>rejection appears to be based on the affirmance of the prior case [by the board] on inadequate disclosure and the art rejection.</blockquote>

The next thing it did was to hold <a id="p1441" href="#p1441" data-label="1441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1441</a>expressly that the original rejection on the ground of inadequate disclosure was in error, saying by way of explanation:</p>
    <blockquote id="b805-3" data-blocks='[["BL_805.4",805,[133,345,1255,156]]]'>We independently passed upon this question solely because, if on review the <em>res judicata </em>rejection should be considered to be an error on some basis that we cannot see, our independent views on the subject of adequacy of disclosure would be present in the record.</blockquote>
    <p id="b805-4" data-blocks='[["BL_805.5",805,[98,522,1327,94]]]'>Then, considering the <em>res juclieata </em>based on the art rejection and its affirmance in the prior application, the board said (our emphasis):</p>
    <blockquote id="b805-5" data-blocks='[["BL_805.6",805,[131,639,1257,196]]]'>We independently passed upon the art rejection as made in the instant case and show that <em>we are of the opinion that the subject matter is patentable over the art used. </em>We did this, so that our differing viewpoint would be clearly of record if, on review, the <em>res judicata </em>rejection should be found to be in error for some reason that we have been unable to ascertain.</blockquote>
    <p id="b805-6" data-blocks='[["BL_805.7",805,[95,860,1329,244]]]'>Thus, the board held herein that both of the prior rejections, by another panel of the board, underlying the <em>res judicata </em>rejection herein — inadequate disclosure and unpatentability over prior art — were <em>wrong. </em>It then proceeded, nevertheless, to sustain the <em>res judicata rejection. </em>After an analysis of the claims, the board stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b805-7" data-blocks='[["BL_805.8",805,[130,1126,1255,115]]]'>Thus the claims before us introduce no question of patentability other than those passed upon in the parent case.

Each art rejection is reversed.</blockquote>
    <p id="b805-9" data-blocks='[["BL_805.10",805,[92,1430,1329,292]]]'>In summary, though the board found the claims to define patentable subject matter and to be proper claims and found the prior board decision on the inadequacy of the disclosure to have been wrong, it felt obliged to refuse them on the legal theory of <em>res judicata. </em>The board thus found itself bound by its own previous errors. We reverse. We consider this to be an improper application of the doctrine .</p>
    <p id="b805-10" data-blocks='[["BL_805.11",805,[90,1731,1330,242]]]'>When the Patent Office, through its duly constituted tribunal, has determined that claims are patentable to an applicant under the statute, allowance of those claims should not be refused merely because on a previous occasion the same or similar claims have been refused on grounds no longer deemed to be valid.</p>

There are additional public policy considerations which have a bearing here, namely, furtherance of the policy inherent in the patent laws to grant patents when the Patent Office finds that <em>'patentable </em>inventions have been disclosed and properly claimed so that such inventions are made public through the grant. The granting of such patents is also in <a id="p1442" href="#p1442" data-label="1442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1442</a>the public interest in that it may stimulate the commercialization of the patented inventions, thus bringing them into actual use for the benefit of the public. Society stands to lose — if there is any validity at all to the theories underlying the patent system — when a patent is refused on an invention which is patentable under the statute. It has been held by the board that such invention is here being claimed. As was said in the opinion of the Chief Judge in <em>Kerr-.</em>

That doctrine is based on considerations of public policy and it seems to us that broad countervailing policy considerations preclude its application in this case, as they did in <em>Herr.</em>

    <p id="b806-6" data-blocks='[["BL_806.6",806,[254,1351,1327,336]]]'>Nevertheless, though we do not rely on it, there exists sufficient technical ground for not applying <em>res judicata </em>in that the claims here on appeal are substantially different from the claims in the parent application with respect to the subject matter covered.

    <p id="b806-7" data-blocks='[["BL_806.7",806,[253,1700,1325,304]]]'>In <em>Kaghan </em>we held that by setting up and publishing in the Rules and the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure the practice which was followed by appellants in that case, which is the same as the practice followed by appellants in this case, the Patent Office was estopped to reject solely on the theory of <em>res judicata. </em>The following passage, with added emphasis, states the gist of the holding:</p>

Once again, similarly to what the solicitor had to say in his brief in <em>Herr </em>(see footnote 3 of the writer’s concurring opinion), a point is made of the “paramount interest” of the public as a “silent party to every proceeding in which a patent has been refused by the Patent Office.” Indeed, we agree that it is, but not, as urged, on the side of the Patent Office right “to reject on the ground of <em>res </em>judicata.” Rather, the paramount interest of the public is to have patents issued when it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Patent Office that patentable inventions are claimed, notwithstanding the doctrine of res judicata, the proper application of which lies in entirely different situations.</p>
