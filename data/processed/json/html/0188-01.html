Considering that statutory provision in connection with the provision in section 20-1323, previously mentioned, to the effect that the docketing of a claim shall constitute notice to the executor of its existence, we conclude that it was the purpose of Congress to afford a claimant protection against the statute of limitations upon the docketing with the Register of Wills of a duly authenticated claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> That is, the docketing of a duly authenticated claim is intended to protect the claimant as does the institution of a suit by tolling the general three-year statute of limitations.</p>

The court there said that the executor’s rejection of the claim based on his knowledge <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>of it stemming from its having been docketed was ineffective and did not trigger the running of the special three-month statute of limitations. The court explained that the only way in which the claim could be effectively rejected was if there had been an actual exhibition of the claim to the executor. <em>See </em>D.C.Code 1967, § 20-1318. Finding that the exhibition of the claim even though it was prior to the day the executor qualified was adequate, it affirmed the decision of the trial court. The question therefore was merely one of under what circumstances an executor may reject a claim.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[186,984,749,426]]]'>The issue here, on the other hand, is simply what tolls the running of the general statute of limitations on a claim against an estate; specifically, is it tolled by the docketing of a duly authenticated claim.

    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[179,1463,752,1090]]]'>Appellees argue that according to the last clause of D.C.Code 1967, § 20-1324, the docketing of a claim “does not take a debt out of the operation of a defense of limitations.” Examining that entire Code section, we find that the first portion provides that the docketing of a claim that is appropriately controverted does not afford evidence as to the justice or correctness of a debt therein entered in a suit instituted for the recovery of a debt. Reading the section in its entirety, we conclude that its purpose was to make it abundantly clear that the mere docketing of a claim did not necessarily establish its validity nor deprive the estate of any defense of limitations that it might have. That is to say, if a claim has already been barred by the running of the statute then the docketing of the claim will not operate to reinstate it any more than it will afford evidence of the justice or correctness of the debt.</p>

    <p id="b230-8" data-blocks='[["BL_230.8",230,[986,531,756,957]]]'>Had the Congress intended the result claimed by appellees, it certainly would not have spoken in terms of “a defense of limitations.” The result appellees seek is not only impractical but, had it been desired by the Congress, could have been expressed quite easily by providing that the docketing-of a claim would not <em>toll </em>the running of the statute of limitations. This it did not do and common sense demands that creditors who have duly docketed their claims against an estate should not be required also to “exhibit the claim to the executor or administrator” or to file suit in order to. toll the running of the statute. The purpose of exhibiting the claim is to give the executor an opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether it is a valid claim. It has no bearing on the running of the statute of limitations.</p>

But this title also has another purpose, one that goes hand in hand with the protection of the executor, and that is the protection of creditors of the estate as well. The docketing of the claim with the Register of Wills pursuant to the statute provides this protection both for the executor and the claimants. Any other reading of the title would be strained and result in a procedural nightmare for probate practitioners.</p>
