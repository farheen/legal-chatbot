The issue before this Court is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s denial of Bashore’s appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the order of the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b311-15" data-blocks='[["BL_311.16",311,[966,1352,751,766]]]'>On August 19, 2010, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Trooper, William Foutz, was dispatched to Daub Lane in Bethel Township to investigate a hit-and-run motor vehicle accident in which a motorist was driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and struck a mailbox. When he arrived, Trooper Foutz observed Bashore behind the wheel of her vehicle, which was located in a pull-off area on Daub Lane. Daub Lane is a gravel road that provides access to driveways of several residences. Although it is not gated, Daub Lane is marked as a “private drive” by a sign at its entrance.</p>

He testified that she smelled like alcohol, her speech was slurred, she was unable to clearly answer his questions, and she was very unsteady on her feet when he asked her to exit the vehicle. His investigation revealed that Bashore’s husband reported the accident, and that Bashore had been at her sister’s house and was on her way <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>home when she struck a mailbox on Maple Lane.

On October 13, 2010, Bashore appealed to the trial court. A hearing was held on December 17, 2010, following which the parties were asked to brief the issue of whether Daub Lane was a trafficway. By order issued January 21, 2011, the trial court denied Bashore’s appeal and reinstated her license suspension.

Thus, the only issue remaining is whether Trooper Foutz had reasonable grounds to believe that Bashore was under the influence of alcohol while operating her vehicle. Bashore argues on appeal that because she was not operating her vehicle on a “highway” or “trafficway,” Trooper Foutz did not have reasonable grounds to request that she submit to a chemical testing. We disagree.</p>

However, it is clear from a strict reading of the Implied Consent Law that it does not require that Trooper Foutz have reasonable grounds to believe that Bashore was operating her vehicle on a highway or trafficway, but that he have “reasonable grounds to believe [Bashore] to have been driving, operating or in actual physical control of the movement of a vehicle” while under the influence of alcohol. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(a).</p>

We not[e] initially that, for ‘reasonable grounds’ to exist, the police officer obviously need not be correct in his belief that the motorist had been driving while intoxicated. We are dealing here with the authority to request a person to submit to a chemical test and not with the admission into evidence of the result of such a test. The only valid inquiry on this issue at the de novo hearing is whether, viewing the facts and circumstances as they appeared at the time, a reasonable person in the position of the police officer could have concluded that the motorist was operating the vehicle and under the influence of intoxicating liquor....</blockquote>

The trial court deemed this a reasonable basis on which Trooper Foutz could believe that Bashore was operating her vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and so do we. Whether or not the underlying DUI arrest is lawful is relevant in a criminal proceeding. A license suspension stemming from a refusal to submit to chemical testing is a separate administrative proceeding. Accordingly, this Court has specifically held that “the lawfulness of a driver’s underlying DUI arrest is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether a licensee’s operating privileges were properly suspended as a consequence of the driver’s refusal to submit to chemical testing under the implied consent statute.” <em>Mitchell v.
