Bennett stated that $8,000 of the money he carried was his mother’s, and that he was supposed to buy a diesel engine for a 15 passenger bus owned by his mother. He had no further information about the engine he was supposed to purchase. Bennett told Trooper Gilbert that he did odd jobs for his father in New York and had saved $1,000. Part of that money was used to purchase the tickets to Jamaica and he had taken several hundred dollars with him on the trip. However, a foreign exchange receipt showed that he had exchanged $5,400 in U.S. currency for Jamaican money during his trip.

When Mr. Bennett testified on July 8, 1992, he stated that he never told his mother about the seizure of "her bus money” at the Philadelphia airport by the State Police. Moreover, although he had not spoken with his mother since November of 1991, he had spoken with the mother of his children in Jamaica during this ten month period of time. (N.T. 133). He did not testify that any of the money seized <em>on </em>November 22, 1991, belonged to him. He stated that it belonged to his mother, Delores Jackson. (N.T. 145). Beyond Respondent’s statement, no evidence was presented to support the contention that the money in question was the property of Delores Jackson.</blockquote>

Bennett argues that the Commonwealth should not be able to rely on the evidence of his subsequent arrest in North Carolina to support the seizure and forfeiture. Because we believe the Commonwealth met its burden of proof even without relying on the evidence, we need not address that argument. However, we recognize that the federal courts have held that evidence to support a forfeiture includes not only evidence obtained before the seizure of the property, but also evidence obtained after the seizure, usually without any rationale as to why the evidence is probative. <em>See United States v. $41,305.00 in Currency and Traveler's Checks, </em><a href="/f2d/802/1339-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="802 F.2d 1339" data-case-ids="1625122" data-case-paths="/f2d/802/1339-01">802 F.2d 1339</a> (11th Cir.1986); <em>United States v.
