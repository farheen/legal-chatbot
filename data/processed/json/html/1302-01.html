When a tax deed purchaser relies on the deed to bring an action in ejectment or a summary action for possession, there is a right to a jury trial as in any other action for possession. <em>See generally </em>85 C.J.S. <em>Taxation </em>§ 967 (1954) “Ordinarily, a tax purchaser’s suit for possession of the land should be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction at law, and not in equity” (footnotes omitted). In this case, however, it is impossible to know in advance whether, upon remand, there will be fact questions requiring submission to a jury, for it is conceivable that the case can be disposed of solely as a matter of law, depending on the trial court’s analysis. We therefore leave it to the trial court to resolve the threshold questions of law and thus to determine whether questions of fact, requiring a jury, remain at issue.</p>
