The trial court directed that both guilty pleas be withdrawn and sentences vacated as to each information. Appellant appealed. On appeal, the Superior Court held that the trial court lacked the authority to <em>sua sponte </em>change appellant’s guilty plea on the first information. The court reasoned that a plea of guilty is the equivalent of a conviction by the verdict of a jury, and a trial judge’s authority over such a verdict is limited to consideration of post-verdict motions. <em><a href="/pa-super/411/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="411 Pa.

Here, ultimately, it was defendant who opted to place Maurice Jackson on the stand, and to elicit testimony from him which the trial court found conflicted with Jackson’s guilty plea. In this case, it was not an event outside of the defendant’s or defense counsel’s control which resulted in the prejudicial testimony.
