McDougall, Sr. began to receive worker’s compensation disability benefits for a work-related injury. Payments were made pursuant to an agreement between [McDougall] and his employer, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., and continued thereafter.” Because McDougall was seeking to collect benefits that had been awarded <em>in addition </em>to those he had been receiving since 1991, the Superior Court concluded that the five-year statute of limitations found at <a href="/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%2019%2C%20%C2%A7%202361" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="Del.

At the time McDougall filed his civil action for additional benefits, he was continuing to receive payments from National Union under the original 1991 award of compensation. Therefore, we hold that the Superior Court correctly concluded that McDougall’s complaint was timely filed because section 2361(b) applied to McDougall’s civil action to enforce the payment of the <em>additional </em>benefits that he was awarded in 1998 and 1999.</p>
