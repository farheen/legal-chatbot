We can think of no reason in law or policy to apply such a restrictive meaning to the word children. Long ago this jurisdiction departed from the common law view that the natural father of an illegitimate child had no obligation of support. As was said in United States v. Philippine Nat.

It would be anomalous-to hold that “children” included illegitimate children when applied to custody but excluded them when their support was involved.

The same distinction prevails here.</p>
