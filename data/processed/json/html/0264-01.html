Holder appeals from a trial court order dismissing for lack of personal <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>jurisdiction a class action brought by Holder against Haarmann &amp; Reimer Corporation (H <em>&amp; </em>R) under the District’s Antitrust Act of 1980, D.C.Code §§ 28-4501 <em>et seq. </em>(1996 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000). On appeal, Holder contends that H &amp; R transacts business in the District and that, contrary to the trial judge’s finding, H &amp; R is therefore amenable to suit in the Superior Court. Holder bases his jurisdictional theory solely on the following asserted contacts between H <em>&amp; </em>R and the District: H &amp; R conspired with other manufacturers, outside the District, to fix the price of citric acid; H <em>&amp; </em>R then sold citric acid at an artificially inflated price to manufacturers outside the District; the manufacturers integrated the citric acid into various end products; the manufacturers then sold the end products directly or indirectly to retailers; the retailers subsequently sold the end products to consumers throughout the country; an unknown number of these consumers purchased, in the District, end products, some unknown quantity of which was alleged to have contained citric acid manufactured by H <em>&amp; </em>R. According to Holder, these asserted contacts constitute transacting business in the District of Columbia within the meaning of our long-arm statute, D.C.Code § 13-423(a)(l) (1995 &amp; 2001).</p>

In other words, H <em>&amp; </em>R would be deemed to be transacting business anywhere that a product containing any amount of citric acid produced by H <em>&amp; </em>R was ultimately sold to a consumer. Such a definition of transacting business recognizes no sensible limiting principle and would require H &amp; R to anticipate being haled into court virtually anywhere in the world on the theory that it transacts business everywhere. The logic of Holder’s argument appears to assume that, as the seller of a chattel, H &amp; R has effectively transacted business in the District by “appointing] the chattel [its] agent for service of process; [H &amp; R’s] amenability to suit [on a transaction of business theory] would travel with the chattel.” <em>Worldr-Wide Volkswagen v.

According to the plaintiff, H <em>&amp; </em>R’s citric acid was then sold to manufacturers who, in turn, integrated it <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>into a variety of end products<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which were sold to retailers and then ultimately to consumers, <em>inter alia, </em>in the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[191,508,756,1457]]]'>The present suit had its origins in the criminal prosecution of H &amp; R for conspiring to fix the price of citric acid in violation of federal antitrust laws. On January 29, 1997, pursuant to a plea agreement, H &amp; R entered a plea of guilty in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to criminal violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="15 U.S.C. §§ 1">15 U.S.C. §§ 1</a> <em>et seq. </em>(1994 &amp; Supp. V 1999). The unlawful conduct embraced by the plea occurred over a period that began in early 1991 and continued through mid-1995. The violation of the District’s Act alleged by Holder in this case was premised on the price-fixing conspiracy that was the subject of the federal prosecution. Specifically, Holder alleges that, during the time period in which the federal violations were occurring, he and the other potential class members “purchased in the District of Columbia beverages, foods and other consumer goods containing citric acid manufactured or distributed by [H &amp; R],” and that he and the other potential plaintiffs “sustained damages arising from the overpayment for consumer goods containing citric acid as a result of [H <em>&amp; </em>R’s] violations of the District of Columbia antitrust laws.”</p>

R. 12(b)(2), H &amp; R filed a motion to dismiss Holder’s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. H &amp; R asserted that it had not transacted business in the District of Columbia and that the company did not have the required minimum contacts with the District which would permit the Superior Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over H <em>&amp; </em>R. H <em>&amp; </em>R’s motion was accompanied by an affidavit by Susan I. Baer, H &amp; R’s corporate secretary, in which she represented, <em>inter alia, </em>that H &amp; R had no office in the District of Columbia and that the company had not engaged in any business within this jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On July 9,1999, following a hearing on this motion, the trial judge dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Holder has thus conceded, for purposes of this appeal, that H &amp; R’s alleged transaction of business in the District constitutes the only basis for the exercise by the Superior Court of personal jurisdiction over H &amp; R. In other words, Holder’s concession means that if the company did not transact business in the District, the trial court’s judgment must be affirmed, and our inquiry is confined accordingly.

In his brief on appeal, Holder further argues that the Superior Court has personal jurisdiction over H &amp; R because "H &amp; R engaged in intentional criminal acts[, <em>i.e., </em>the price-fixing conspiracy to which it entered a plea of guilty,] the effect of which reached into the District of Columbia by damaging whoever purchased food and beverage products containing citric acid in the District,1' so that the "ultimate victims of [H <em>&amp; </em>R's] criminal acts were the District consumers at the end of the distribution chain.” (Footnote omitted.) Adopting this argument, however, would require us to base personal jurisdiction over H &amp; R on a separate prong of the District's long-arm statute, namely on the provision which authorizes the Superior Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant who has "causfed] tortious injury in the District of Columbia by an act or omission outside the District of Columbia.” D.C.Code § 13 — 423(a)(4). At oral argument, counsel for plaintiff expressly disavowed reliance on this statutory provision, and he asked us to find personal jurisdiction over H &amp; R solely under the "transacting business” prong, D.C.Code § 13-423(a)(1). See <em>supra </em>pp. ---. In light of the position taken by his attorney, we have no occasion to consider arguments supportive of personal jurisdiction over H &amp; R under D.C.Code § 13-423(a)(4). Consequently, the reliance in Holder’s brief on authorities such as, <em>e.g., Calder v. Jones, </em><a href="/us/465/0783-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="465 U.S. 783" data-case-ids="11337451" data-case-paths="/us/465/0783-01">465 U.S. 783</a>, <a href="/us/465/0783-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="465 U.S. 783" data-case-ids="11337451" data-case-paths="/us/465/0783-01">104 S.Ct. 1482</a>, <a href="/us/465/0783-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="465 U.S. 783" data-case-ids="11337451" data-case-paths="/us/465/0783-01">79 L.Ed.2d 804</a> (1984), is misplaced. In <em>Calder </em>and like cases, personal jurisdiction was founded upon a tortious injury sustained within the forum but caused by conduct elsewhere. <em>E.g., </em>465 U.S. at 789-90, <a href="/us/465/0783-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="465 U.S. 783" data-case-ids="11337451" data-case-paths="/us/465/0783-01">104 S.Ct. 1482</a>. Moreover, under D.C.Code § 13—423(a)(4), Holder also would have to demonstrate that H &amp; R "regularly does or solicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed, or services rendered, in the District of Columbia.”</p>

The District's long-arm statute, unlike the statutes of certain jurisdictions involved in cases upon which Holder relies, does not contain a provision under which the in-state commission of a tort is defined as "doing business" in the forum. <em>See, e.g., Keeton, <a href="/us/465/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="465 U.S. 770" data-case-ids="11337359" data-case-paths="/us/465/0770-01">supra,</a> </em>465 U.S. at 774 n. 4, <a href="/us/465/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="465 U.S. 770" data-case-ids="11337359" data-case-paths="/us/465/0770-01">104 S.Ct. 1473</a> (citing such a provision in New Hampshire long-arm statute).</p>

We also note that New Hampshire, the forum at issue in <em>Keeton, </em>had a long-arm statute under which the in-state commission of a tort was defined as "doing business” in the forum. 465 U.S. at 774 n. 4, <a href="/us/465/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="465 U.S. 770" data-case-ids="11337359" data-case-paths="/us/465/0770-01">104 S.Ct. 1473</a>. The District has no such statute. Furthermore, the Court concluded that the libel at issue in <em>Keeton </em>was a tort that occurred at least partially in the forum, 465 U.S. at 776, <a href="/us/465/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="465 U.S. 770" data-case-ids="11337359" data-case-paths="/us/465/0770-01">104 S.Ct. 1473</a>, and the requirement that the nonresident defendant transact business in the forum was therefore doubly satisfied. But see <em>supra </em>pp. 272-274.</p>

The only specific location disclosed in the record at which H &amp; R sold its citric acid is "the Northern District of California.” However, the affidavit of H &amp; R’s corporate secretary specifically states that "none of [H &amp; R’s citric acid customers was] located in D.C.”</p>

Holder also argues that the Superior Court should be permitted to exercise personal jurisdiction over H &amp; R because, according to Holder, the District's Antitrust Act was intended to reach a defendant's activity outside the District so long as that activity had a significant effect within the District. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this was the legislative intent, we believe that it would put the cart before the horse to conclude that the entire constitutionally-mandated minimum contacts analysis may simply be jettisoned whenever a legislature enacts a statute which is intended to have extraterritorial application. On the contrary, we emphasize that the personal jurisdiction analysis must precede, and proceed independently of, the question whether a substantive District of Columbia statute has been violated. <em>See Keeton, <a href="/us/465/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="465 U.S. 770" data-case-ids="11337359" data-case-paths="/us/465/0770-01">supra,</a> </em>465 U.S. at 778, <a href="/us/465/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="465 U.S. 770" data-case-ids="11337359" data-case-paths="/us/465/0770-01">104 S.Ct. 1473</a> (explaining that the question of "the applicability of [a forum statute] presents itself in the course of litigation only after jurisdiction over [the nonresident defendant] is established”).</p>
