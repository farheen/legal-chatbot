Because we agree with the State’s contention that the trial court erred in finding that the testimony of the complaining juvenile witness was so unreliable that a jury acting rationally could not avoid having a reasonable doubt as to Spooner’s guilt, we vacate the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b922-6" data-blocks='[["BL_922.6",922,[226,1257,751,608]]]'>In January 1993, Spooner was indicted on one count of gross sexual assault and one count of unlawful sexual contact. Spooner pleaded not guilty to both counts. At the close of the State’s case-in-chief, Spooner moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to M.R.Crim.P. 29. The court denied the motion. At the close of all of the evidence, Spooner renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The court took the motion under advisement. Guilty verdicts on both counts were returned by the jury against Spooner.</p>
    <p id="b922-7" data-blocks='[["BL_922.7",922,[227,1912,747,372]],["BL_922.8",922,[1033,212,745,85]]]'>Spooner filed a timely motion for a new trial, including a motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to M.R.Crim.P. 33 and M.R.Crim.P. 29(b). The trial court granted Spooner’s motion for a new trial, finding “the testimony of [the] complaining juvenile witness ... [to be] contradictory, unreasonable or incredible.” The State appeals from that order, which we view as an entry of a judgment of acquittal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The victim’s mother and a family friend testified that the victim once stated that she believed she could avoid having to live in a foster home by making similar accusations about a foster parent as she had made about Spooner.</p>
    <p id="b922-11" data-blocks='[["BL_922.11",922,[1024,1088,750,651]]]'>Although the jury found Spooner guilty on both counts, the trial court concluded, based on the “flaws and inconsistencies evident in ... [the victim’s] story,” that the verdicts were unwarranted. The court noted that the victim’s testimony, “although cogent at times, was seriously inconsistent with prior statements that she had made and with certain testimony of other witnesses.” As evidence, the court made reference to a number of prior conflicting statements made by the victim to a school counselor, Department of Human Services caseworkers, a state police detective, family members, and friends.</p>

In that case, the victim initially was reluctant to answer questions relating to sexual abuse. At first she stated that she could no longer remember the incidents, later denied that the defendant had molested her, then stated that the defendant had, in fact, been the source of abuse. <em><a href="/a2d/559/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="559 A.2d 361" data-case-ids="7885812" data-case-paths="/a2d/559/0361-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/559/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="559 A.2d 361" data-case-ids="7885812" data-case-paths="/a2d/559/0361-01">at 362</a>.

It is the role of the factfinder to resolve such inconsistencies and conflicts in the testimony of a witness. The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the jury “in whose exclusive province it is to judge the credibility of witnesses and to determine the weight to be given inconsistent testimony.” <em>Id.; see also State v.

The victim also denied having told her mother that she could avoid placement in a foster home by levelling accusations against others similar to the ones she had made against Spooner. Moreover, unlike the facts in <em>Murray </em>or <em>Sanders, </em>the victim’s testimony was consistent throughout both direct and cross-examinations.
