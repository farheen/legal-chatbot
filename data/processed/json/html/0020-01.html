In <em>Williams, </em>the criminal attacked a 61-year-old woman who was walking her dog. He grabbed her from behind, choked her and threw her to the ground, beat her and attempted to rob her. Williams was convicted and sentenced on aggravated assault, criminal attempt at robbery and unlawful restraint. Superior Court determined that this attack was one successive criminal act. Working with that description of the facts, we addressed the question of whether one criminal act can spawn multiple convictions and sentences. We answered that it could so long as sentences are not imposed for both greater and lesser included offenses.</p>
    <p id="b79-16" data-blocks='[["BL_79.17",79,[939,1363,757,1004]]]'>In <em>Weakland, </em>the criminal was convicted and sentenced on a number of crimes, including, inter alia, murder, robbery, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and theft in a criminal episode in which Weakland and his brother robbed a filling station. During the robbery, Weakland murdered the station owner, assaulted the owner’s wife, and attacked a customer in the course of trying to escape. He struck the customer with a gun, held him at gunpoint, and forced him to drive Weakland away from the robbery-murder scene. The merger issue in the case concerning this customer-victim was whether the assault in striking the customer with the gun merged into the kidnapping conviction for sentencing purposes. We held that it did not because the force requirement of kidnapping was supplied by holding the customer at gunpoint, not by the assault, and the assault was, therefore, a separate crime.</p>

That holding does not apply to the present case <em>[Weakland </em>] because the problem here is not whether the same facts support multiple convictions, but whether facts in evidence <em>additional </em>to those facts establish aggravated assault, i.e., that James Weak-land continued to threaten Mr. Wilson with a handgun, should have been used to satisfy the threat or force requirement of kidnapping. It is our view that the additional facts should be used to satisfy the force or threat element of kidnapping, for otherwise a violent criminal would be permitted to perpetrate multiple crimes while suffering only partial liability for the harm he has wrought.</blockquote>

The flaw in the analysis is that there is no legally significant difference between the eases. Whether the criminals in these cases committed one act or many is of no import. In either event, so long as the crimes are not greater and lesser included offenses, they are liable for as many crimes as they are convicted of and may be sentenced for each such crime.</p>
    <p id="b80-10" data-blocks='[["BL_80.10",80,[1008,625,754,1204]]]'>Accordingly, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Williams </em>and abrogate the holding in <em>Weakland. </em>We now hold that in all criminal cases, the same facts may support multiple convictions and separate sentences for each conviction except in cases where the offenses are greater and lesser included offenses. “The same facts” means any act or acts which the accused has performed and any intent which the accused has manifested, regardless of whether these acts and intents are part of one criminal plan, scheme, transaction or encounter, or multiple criminal plans, schemes transactions or encounters. In other words, it does not matter for purposes of merger whether one regards Weak-land’s striking the customer and kidnapping him as one encounter or as two encounters, for the same facts, i.e., striking the victim with a gun, may be used to satisfy the force requirements of at least two crimes, kidnapping and aggravated assault, and the sentences for each crime will not merge because these crimes are not greater and lesser included offenses.</p>
    <p id="b80-11" data-blocks='[["BL_80.11",80,[1007,1876,753,858]]]'>Our concern, as we pointed out in <em>Weak-land, </em>is to avoid giving criminals a “volume discount” on crime. If multiple acts of criminal violence were regarded as part of one larger criminal transaction or encounter which is punishable only as one crime, then there would be no legally recognized difference between a criminal who robs someone at gunpoint and a criminal who robs the person and during the same transaction or encounter pistol whips him in order to effect the robbery. But in Pennsylvania, there is a legally recognized difference between these two crimes. The criminal in the latter case may be convicted of more than one crime and sentences for each conviction may be imposed where the crimes are not greater and lesser included offenses.</p>

He shot Ms. DeBooth and critically injured her by his commission of that single act. The question which arises on our reformulation of the rule is whether Anderson’s single criminal act will support convictions and sentences for more than one crime. In order to answer this question, we must consider whether the crimes of attempted murder and aggravated assault are greater and lesser included offenses.</p>
    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[144,776,756,659]]]'>Aggravated assault is defined as either attempting to cause or causing “serious bodily injury to another ... intentionally, knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1). Criminal attempt to murder is defined by reading the attempt statute, 18 Pa.C.S. § 901(a), in conjunction with the murder statute, 18 Pa. C.S. § 2502(a). Thus, attempted murder is defined as taking a substantial step towards an intentional killing. We are comparing an inchoate crime (attempted murder) with a choate crime (aggravated assault).</p>

Prior to <em>Weakland </em>and <em>Williams, </em>the merger analysis was “broader and more flexible” than the double jeopardy test in that it included a consideration as to whether a particular criminal act offended more than one interest of the state and whether “on the facts of the case, the two crimes were so intimately bound up in the same wrongful act that as a <em>practical </em>matter proof of one crime necessarily proves the other, so that they must be treated as the same offense.” <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa-super/344/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="344 Pa.

Thus, a merger analysis was different from a double jeopardy analysis, for it required a consideration of facts and the state’s interests which was not part of the double jeopardy analysis. Since <em>Weakland </em>and <em>Williams, </em>however, there is no difference between a double jeopardy analysis and a merger analysis: double jeopardy and merger are identical and the operative consideration in both is whether the elements of the offenses are the same or different.</p>
