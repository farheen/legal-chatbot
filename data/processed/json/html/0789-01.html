In other words, it is claimed that, as the subject matter in issue has been patented to King, the common assignee can not obtain an additional and later patent for the precise claims by incorporating them in the Hendry application. The case of <em>In re </em>Dunbar, <em><a href="" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="51 App. D.C. 251">supra,</a> </em>is cited as authority for this contention.

It may be that the patentee party of the common assignee is earlier than assignee’s applicant party. But independently of whether the common assignee took out its patented claims in the application of its first inventor of their subject matter, clearly the adverse party is not entitled to an award of priority unless he is prior to botli of them.</blockquote>
