    <p id="b805-6" data-blocks='[["BL_805.6",805,[152,1313,751,997]]]'>The “odd” and “even” year terminology of the 1959 Amendment placed substantial restrictions upon the General Assembly as to the timing and nature of its permissible activities. Those restrictions raised serious questions as to the constitutional powers of the General Assembly. E. G., Opinion of the Justices, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Storey%20524" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Storey 524">4 Storey 524</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="181 A.2d 215">181 A.2d 215</a> (1962); Opinion of the Justices, Del., <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20687" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="198 A.2d 687">198 A.2d 687</a> (1964); Opinion of the Justices, Del., <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20570" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="200 A.2d 570">200 A.2d 570</a> (1964). By removing the “odd” and “even” year restrictions of the 1959 Amendment, and substituting the “calendar” year language of the 1969 Amendment, the 1969 framers gave the General Assembly desirable flexibility and removed the cumbersome restrictions theretofore imposed upon it. This, we think, was the primary purpose and intent of the provisions of the present Art. 2, § 4.</p>

    <p id="b806-4" data-blocks='[["BL_806.4",806,[199,697,753,619]]]'>The weakness of that line of reasoning lies, we think, in the more reasonable assumption that the 1969 framers could have, and would have, been more clear and precise had it been their intention, in view of Sched. § 4, to change the terms of members of the General Assembly to run from second Tuesday in January to second Tuesday in January, in order to remove the hiatus. Such change would have removed the entire hiatus — not just the portion thereof which would be avoided by the “calendar year” term urged by its proponents.</p>
    <p id="b806-5" data-blocks='[["BL_806.5",806,[197,1366,753,715]]]'>It is also suggested that, by the “calendar year” language, the 1969 framers of Art. 2, § 4 intended to make the terms of the members of the General Assembly substantially similar to the terms of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, and the President and members of the Congress of the United States —all of whom take office on a Tuesday in the January following Election Day. Again, we think that had such conformity been the intention of the 1969 framers, something more precise than the “calendar year” terminology could have, and would have, been devised, in view of Sched. § 4.</p>

It follows, in our opinion, that the terms of the members of the previous General Assembly (the 127th) ended simultaneously.</p>

It has the power to transact business to precisely the same extent as when in session after the second Tuesday in January. The reason, of course, is that the General Assembly is a separate branch of State Government and, within its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction, it is independent of the Executive Branch. Cf. DuPont v. DuPont, Del.Supr., 32 Del.ch. 413, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20724" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="85 A.2d 724">85 A.2d 724</a> (1951). Absent constitutional limitations, and we find none, the General Assembly has unrestrained authority to exercise its proper legislative powers in any manner it sees fit. Cf. State v.

And that requires careful attention to, and respectful consideration of, the acts of one branch by another, to the end that there may be, in the language of The Federalist, Number 47, a “chain of connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one indissoluble bond of unity and amity.”</p>
