Ashness (Ashness), from a Superior Court judgment granting the second motion for relief from judgment of First Bank and Trust Company (First Bank). In the judgment that Ashness challenges, the Superior Court justice (1) declared G.L.1956 (1991 Reenactment) § 46-21-52 unconstitutional, (2) declared null and void <em>ab initio </em>a tax sale of certain real estate in the city of Central Falls held on October 12, 1990, by the Blackstone Valley District Commission (Blackstone commission), (3) vacated a January 9, 1992 judgment against First Bank and others that had foreclosed all rights of redemption with regard to that sale of the subject property, and (4) declared the title to the property vested in the defendant Joyce Tomasetti (Tomasetti) subject to all mortgages and other encumbrances of record.</p>
    <p id="b869-17" data-blocks='[["BL_869.18",869,[964,642,755,1187]]]'>We have gleaned the following facts from the very brief transcript and other portions of the record in this case. In November 1991 Ashness filed in the Superior Court a petition to foreclose a tax lien. In the petition he alleged that on October 12, 1990, the Blackstone commission had sold the subject real property for the nonpayment of taxes or fees. The commission had conveyed the property by an instrument dated November 29, 1990, and recorded on December 3, 1990, in book 250, page 261. Ashness also asserted that more than a year from the date of the sale had elapsed and no redemption had been made. The petition declared that the deed had been recorded within sixty days from the sale date and that Ashness then held title under the instrument. Ashness provided a list of people or entities known to him as possessing any interest in the land and described the nature of the interest as follows: Tomasetti, former fee holder; Suburban Land Co. (Suburban), tax lien holder; and several mortgagees, including First Bank. All these parties were named as defendants.</p>
    <p id="b869-18" data-blocks='[["BL_869.19",869,[966,1865,755,515]]]'>A court-appointed title examiner submitted a report, which a Superior Court justice approved and accepted, containing the same list of people or entities and their possible interest in the subject property. Ashness’s attorney also filed a petition for the appointment of a guardian ad litem and a motion for appointment of an attorney under the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Relief Act. The Superior Court justice appointed attorneys in response to these requests.</p>
    <p id="b869-19" data-blocks='[["BL_869.20",869,[968,2416,754,325]],["BL_870.1",870,[214,238,752,85]]]'>Suburban then filed an answer to Ashness’s petition, which response included an offer to redeem the real estate described in the petition pursuant to G.L.1956 (1988 Reenactment) § 44-9-29. In its answer Suburban stated that it was the holder of a tax title in the subject premises and requested that <a id="p804" href="#p804" data-label="804" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*804</a>the court establish a time and terms for redemption.</p>
    <p id="b870-4" data-blocks='[["BL_870.4",870,[208,345,758,1024]]]'>On January 9,1992, Suburban withdrew its answer and offer to redeem, and it joined with Ashness in his requests for relief. Also on that date, default was entered against defendants in response to Ashness’s application for such entry. In support of his application, Ashness’s counsel submitted an affidavit, in which he attested, among other things, that defendants, except for the attorney for persons in the military service and the guardian ad litem, had faded to plead or defend and that defendants had been duly served with the petition to foreclose. He also filed a certificate of service by registered or certified mail to which were affixed return receipts indicating that Tomasetti, Suburban, First Bank, and the other defendants had been served in November 1991. Additionally on that date the Superior Court justice issued a final decree, ordering that all rights of redemption be forever foreclosed and barred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

That section authorizes a court to relieve a party from a final judgment or decree, among other things, for excusable neglect, mistake, inadvertence, or surprise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Among First Bank’s assertions were the following: that in 1988 its borrowers had executed and delivered to First Bank a promissory note for $165,000 secured by a mortgage on the subject real estate; that without First Bank’s knowledge or consent, the borrowers transferred title to the real estate to a realty corporation, which deed was recorded in 1989, and the realty corporation subsequently transferred title to Tomasetti, by deed recorded May 18, 1990; that on October 12, 1990, the Blackstone commission held a tax sale of the property, which Ashness purchased, and a deed was recorded in December 1990; and that Ashness filed a petition to foreclose the right of redemption relative to that sale and “[njotice of Mr. Ashness’ petition was acknowledged by the Bank by the signing of a certified receipt by Robert Bar-rieelli, the Bank’s messenger, on November 22, 1990.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> First Bank also stated in its motion that on January 23, 1992, Ashness recorded a deed granting a one-half interest in the property to Suburban. First Bank asserted that when it receives a tax-sale notice as a mortgagee, it contacts its customer, and if the customer does not pay the required taxes, First Bank will do so. It claimed not only that § 46-21-52, which authorizes the Blackstone commission to sell the real estate of delinquent taxpayers, does .not mandate that the Blackstone commission notify mortgagees but also that the commission did not in fact notify First Bank of the sale.</p>

By way of explanation First Bank delineated the following “policy” regarding its receipt of a petition to foreclose the right <a id="p805" href="#p805" data-label="805" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*805</a>of redemption: after receiving the mail, First Bank’s messenger is to give it to First Bank’s mail clerk, who then sorts the mail and directs the correspondence to either of two loan officers. Although First Bank conceded that its messenger signed for service of the petition, First Bank assumed that the petition was either lost or misplaced because no First Bank officer received a copy of the petition or had actual knowledge that it had been received. It submitted affidavits of the two loan officers, in which each stated that he or she had not received a copy of the petition to foreclose and had no knowledge of its filing until April 1992. First Bank also filed an affidavit in which its mail clerk denied recalling the receipt of a petition to foreclose the right of redemption in this matter. First Bank also claimed in its motion that it would be inequitable to permit Ashness to acquire a property with an appraised value of $145,000 for $1,186.85, which amount he had paid.</p>
    <p id="b871-5" data-blocks='[["BL_871.4",871,[162,1364,753,509]]]'>In Ashness’s memorandum in opposition to First Bank’s motion for relief from judgment, he asserted that notice to defendants was proper and strictly in accordance with the applicable statute. Ashness also contended that the default judgment must be allowed to stand and that a Superior Court decree in a tax-title foreclosure case is final and absolute and reversible only by the Supreme Court on appeal. Apparently, a Superior Court justice denied First Bank’s motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b871-12" data-blocks='[["BL_871.11",871,[963,232,755,835]]]'>More than six months later, First Bank filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to § 9-21-2(a)(4), seeking an order vacating the January 9, 1992 judgment foreclosing its right of redemption on the ground that the judgment was void. First Bank’s statement of facts contained an important item that was absent from its first motion for relief from judgment: it stated that on June 4, 1990, the Central Falls tax collector had held a tax sale of the subject property and conveyed it to Suburban. Although First Bank repeated the claim it had made in its first motion regarding its lack of notice of the Blaekstone commission’s sale of the property in October 1990, it did not make any reference to any notice that it might have received regarding the earlier tax sale in June 1990.</p>

Ashness further maintained that First Bank suffered no deprivation to trigger Fourteenth Amendment protections because at the time of the Blackstone commission sale “the subject premises were already tax-reverted by virtue of a June sale by the City of Central Falls to Suburban Land Company, so that Bank’s status as mortgagee was unaltered by the second sale.” Ashness also alleged that First Bank had never redeemed from that first sale.</p>

First Bank also stated that it did not ignore notice of Ashness’s petition, and it objected to Ashness’s “reference to the tax sale by the City Collector because no petition was ever filed concerning that sale; and if the Bank is successful in this matter, it will also redeem the property from that sale.”</p>

    <p id="b876-7" data-blocks='[["BL_876.7",876,[1014,505,752,802]]]'>Analyzed by itself, then, § 46-21-52 requires notice of a Blackstone commission “tax sale” to be sent to a resident taxpayer by registered or certified mail, to be left at the resident’s last residence, or to be served on the resident personally. It contains no requirement for notice to mortgagees. Consequently we conclude that it does not comport with the broad holding in <em>Mennonite </em>and, standing alone, it violates constitutional guarantees of due process. As we discussed above and as Ashness argues in part, however, we think that because the Blackstone commission statute refers to and thus incorporates at least certain sections of the municipal-tax-sale statute, we must analyze the provisions of that statute as well.</p>
    <p id="b876-8" data-blocks='[["BL_876.8",876,[1011,1344,753,941]]]'>The municipal-tax-sale statute explicitly authorizes the tax collector to sell by public auction for the amount of unpaid taxes, among other things, the smallest undivided part of the land that will satisfy the tax debt. <em>See </em>§§ 441-9-7, 44-9-8. The statute requires notice by posting and advertisement of the sale. <em>See </em>§ 44-9-9. Section 44-9-10 is similar to § 46-21-52, and the current version mandates notice to a taxpayer, whether or not a state resident, by certified or registered mail, by leaving such notice at the taxpayer’s last and usual place of abode, or by personal service. Section 44-9-11 requires that the tax collector notify mortgagees of record of an upcoming tax sale by one of those three notice methods; with respect to other interested parties, however, that section deems sufficient the notice provided for in § 44-9-9.</p>

Section 44-9-27 requires that such a <a id="p811" href="#p811" data-label="811" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*811</a>petitioner notify all persons who may be interested in the title, including mortgagees, by certified or registered mail, with a return receipt required, of the pendency of the petition. The record reflects that Ashness did accomplish this required mailing of notice.</p>
    <p id="b877-6" data-blocks='[["BL_877.4",877,[166,606,756,909]]]'>We think that although the Blackstone commission statute required notice to resident taxpayers and was silent on notice to mortgagees, or other interested parties, § 44-9-11 was incorporated in the Blackstone scheme. We conclude that the Blackstone commission was therefore required to provide notice to First Bank in the manner prescribed in § 44-9-11. As we noted above, First Bank’s attorney filed an affidavit in the Superior Court, indicating that his review of the Blackstone commission’s records revealed that the commission sent notice of its tax sale to Tomasetti and Suburban only. This notice did not comport with constitutional guarantees of due process with regard to the mortgagees, and therefore, we determine that the sale is void.</p>
    <p id="b877-7" data-blocks='[["BL_877.5",877,[165,1568,755,855]]]'>We recently affirmed a Superior Court judgment voiding a tax sale of which the record owner had not received notice. <em>See Williams v.

Additionally, courts in several jurisdictions have held or acknowledged the rule that the failure to serve an interested party with notice of a tax sale invalidates that sale with respect to all interested parties, despite the fact that at least one of the parties did receive legal or actual notice of the proceedings. <em>See </em>Nora A.

As stated above, however, Ashness’s petition described the land as having been sold by the Blackstone commission by an instrument dated November 29, 1990, and duly recorded on December 3, 1990, in book 250, page 261. Although the record does not contain a copy of the instrument, we conclude that both Ashness's petition and the court’s decree refer to the same instrument, which referenced the Blackstone commission sale.</p>
