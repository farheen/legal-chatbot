On January 23, 1999, Humane Society Officer Felix Anthony Beltram (“Officer Beltram”) responded to a complaint regarding a dead dog inside 713 East Hilton Street, Philadelphia. (Notes of testimony, 7/6/05 at 202-203.) When he arrived, he discovered 13 dogs, 1 dead and 12 alive. <em>(Id. </em>at 150.)

Snead told Officer Beltram that she lived at the home and that the animals were hers. <em>(Id. </em>at 150, 169.)

(Notes of testimony, 7/6/05 at 59; 7/7/05 at 69-70.) Snead was told that the shelter is only required to keep animals for 48 hours; and since the charges were dropped and the dogs were no longer needed as evidence, they were put to sleep. (Notes of testimony, 7/7/05 at 69-70,193-194.) Snead became hysterical and left the shelter. <em>(Id. </em>at 70, 192.) In fact, the dogs were not euthanized until January 30,1999, three days later.

Snead testified that had she been provided notice that the dogs were available to be redeemed, she would have taken them back and complied with any SPCA conditions. (Notes of testimony, 7/7/05 at 70-71.) Snead also testified that several of the dogs were strays that she had taken in with the intention of nursing them back to health. <em>(Id. </em>at 42-43.)</p>

Snead sought judgment for $8,450, the alleged value of the dogs. The municipal court granted judgment in favor of Snead on March 5, 2001, and SPCA appealed on March 22, 2001. The appeal was listed for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the court of common pleas; and on June 19, 2001, Snead filed a civil complaint, alleging trespass, conversion, negligence, and violations of <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C.A. § 1983</a>.

It appearing from the uncontroverted evidence that the house at 713 East Hilton Street was abandoned and that Snead was not actually sleeping in the structure in January 1999, we found that Snead had no legitimate expectation of privacy and her claims of trespass and the violation of her civil rights, based on her Fourth Amendment right to privacy in the structure, failed as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 10-14. However, with regard to Snead’s remaining claims for negligence, conversion, and Section 1983 claims, we remanded for a new trial. We determined that the trial court had improperly weighed conflicting evidence to rule on SPCA’s motion for directed verdict with respect to these claims, including Snead’s testimony that she had attempted to retrieve the dogs on January 27 only to be told they were already dead, testimony which was contra-dieted by Spencer. <em>Id. </em>at 14.

Although, as the prevailing party in the court below, we must accept Snead’s testimony that she went to the shelter on January 27, 1999 and was erroneously informed by Spencer that her dogs were dead,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> this establishes nothing more than mistake or accident on Spencer’s part. Indeed, Spencer testified that he was responsible for approximately 40,000 animals per year, and that on January 23, 1999, when the dogs were brought in by Officer Beltram, he was informed that Snead was involved but was not aware that they actually belonged to her. (Notes of testimony, 7/6/05 at 62, 67, 130.) Furthermore, because the dogs did not bear license tags <em>(id. </em>at 122-124), they were considered strays and it was SPCA’s policy that they only need to be held for 48 hours; as of January 27, 1999, four days after they were brought in and after the dog-fighting charges were dropped, Spencer may simply have assumed that they had been put down. Spencer testified that, in his opinion, the animals were not in a condition to be adopted. <em>(Id. </em>at 131.) At any rate, there is simply no evidence to impute to Spencer or SPCA evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of Snead. Even accepting Snead’s testimony as true and resolving all reasonable inferences in her favor, we cannot say that SPCA acted in conscious disregard of a risk of harm to Snead when it euthanized the animals. Therefore, we reverse the award of $100,000 in punitive damages and will re-enter judgment accordingly.</p>

However, a close reading of our prior memorandum reveals we held only that Snead had no legitimate privacy interest in the house at 713 East Hilton Street, as the uncontested evidence indicated it was abandoned. Therefore, as she had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the structure, she could not maintain a Fourth Amendment claim for Officer Beltram's warrantless search of the property. <em>Snead I, supra </em>at 14.

We note that a defendant can be acting under color of state law for Section 1983 purposes, as SPCA was when it seized and then euthanized Snead’s dogs, and yet not be a government party or entity for jurisdictional or immunity purposes.
