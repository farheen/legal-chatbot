Rohrbaugh points out that, unlike York County, Dauphin County mandates by local rule that all CSFA petitions be filed in the Office of the Prothonotary and that arbitration under Dauph. R.C.P. No. 1301 is applicable to all such actions. (Dauphin R.C.P. 5005, Rohrbaugh’s brief, Exh. ■ “C.”) Rohrbaugh suggests that because statewide uniformity of practice is desirable, clarification of this issue clearly would be beneficial, and the trial court’s decision would only encourage fragmentation of what is ideally a unified state-wide judicial system.</p>

In this regard, Rohrbaugh points out that the current dispute involves cash in an amount not exceeding the $30,000 compulsory arbitration limit, York R.C.P. No. 1301(a), and neither the CSFA nor the state or local rules of civil procedure exclude CSFA actions from arbitration. In fact, Rohrbaugh maintains that the official comments to Pa. R.C.P. No. 1301 (dealing with the scope of compulsory arbitration) suggest that CSFA actions would be appropriate subjects for arbitration in that they are simi<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>lar to replevin actions involving rights to possession of personal property.</p>

R.C.P. No. 1308, and a <em>de novo </em>proceeding before the trial court would follow under Pa. R.C.P. No. 1311. Indeed, as counsel for Rohrbaugh conceded at argument before the trial court, “what I’ve asked for is arbitration for this case, because I believe my client would benefit by having essentially two bites of the apple.” (C.R., N.T. at 8.) The opportunity to litigate at multiple proceedings, thereby having “two bites of the apple,” should not be deemed an “important” interest deeply rooted in public policy for purposes of the collateral order doctrine. In fact, it is contrary to the very purpose of arbitration, which is intended to reduce litigation.</p>

As support for that proposition, Rohrbaugh relies on a portion of the official comment to Pa. R.C.P. No. 1301 stating, “there would seem to be no reason why replevin actions involving the right to possession of personal property could not be referred to arbitration.” However, the CSFA states clearly that “[pjroperty taken or detained under this section shall not be subject to replevin.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6801(d). Moreover, Rohrbaugh ignores a relevant portion of the comment to Pa. R.C.P. No. 1301 that provides, (emphasis added), “[i]n determining which actions to include or exclude, <em>the nature of the action </em>and the relief requested should govern.” Replevin actions are purely civil in nature, whereas forfeiture actions pursuant to the CSFA, although civil in form, are <em>quasi-criminal in nature, </em>intended to impose a penalty upon those involved in criminal enterprises. <em>Landy. </em>Because the authority of a civil board of arbitrators to hear a particular matter rests not with the form of the action but, rather, with the nature of the action, Rohrbaugh’s reliance on the comment to Pa. R.C.P. No. 1301 to support his position is misplaced. Finally, even if forfeiture actions in general may be referred to arbitration, Pa. R.C.P. No. 1301 states that “[tjhese rules apply to actions which are submitted to compulsory arbitration pursuant to local rule ...” Because York County local rules do not grant arbitrators the authority to hear forfeiture cases, and because the comment to Pa. R.C.P. No. 1301 indicates that such a grant of power is not inherent in the “compulsory arbitration” provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure, arbitration of forfeiture claims in York County is not lawful.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

We agree with Rohrbaugh, and the Commonwealth does not dispute, that the January 23, 2006, order satisfies the separability and irreparable loss prongs of the collateral order doctrine. In the present appeal, Rohrbaugh raises issues that are purely procedural and completely unrelated to the merits of the underlying forfeiture petition. Moreover, these issues (the right to have the matter transferred to the Prothonotary and referred to arbitration) would be moot and, thus, not reviewable following entry of a final order in the underlying action.</p>

(2) Cases filed pursuant to the CSFA are governed by the rules of civil procedure where not explicitly trumped by the CSFA. <em>See Commonwealth v. $8006.00 U.S. Currency, </em>166 Pa.Cmwlth. 251, <a href="/a2d/646/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="646 A.2d 621" data-case-ids="12048077,1464367" data-case-paths="/a2d/646/0621-01,/pa-commw/166/0251-01">646 A.2d 621</a> (1994) (holding that to fill in the gap left by the absence of discovery provisions in the CSFA, the discovery rules in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure apply to such actions); <em>Commonwealth v. $1,800 U.S. Currency, </em><a href="/a2d/679/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="679 A.2d 275" data-case-ids="11321730" data-case-paths="/a2d/679/0275-01">679 A.2d 275</a> (Pa.Cmwlth. 1996) (holding that where the CSFA contains sufficient notice provisions, notice in forfeiture actions need not comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure).
