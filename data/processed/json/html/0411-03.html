    <blockquote id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[240,601,710,191]]]'>1. Whether a plaintiff must prove a physical injury in order to be entitled to recover under a strict product liability theory?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[237,809,711,234]]]'>2. Whether the product-line exception to the general rule against successor liability should be part of Pennsylvania’s strict product liability jurisprudence?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b454-8" data-blocks='[["BL_454.8",454,[237,1068,712,1100]]]'>3. If the product line exception is recognized as part of Pennsylvania’s strict product liability jurisprudence, whether the exception should be formulated to strictly require proof of the following before successor liability can be imposed: (1) the successor corporation purchased all or substantially all of the assets of the manufacturer of the product at issue; (2) the successor undertook essentially the same manufacturing operation as the manufacturer of the product alleged to have caused the plaintiffs injuries and then continued to manufacture the same product line; and (3) the transaction between the successor and the manufacturer of the product at issue caused the destruction of the plaintiffs remedies against the manufacturer?</blockquote>
