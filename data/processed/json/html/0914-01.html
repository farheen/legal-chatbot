It does not alter the legal situation that the facts did not- develop until a number of years thereafter. The patent as to these claims was equally invalid because of the error upon the very material matter of who the inventor was. This is the law as fixed by the statute.</p>

This special act passed April 1, 1880, 21 Stat. L. 526.</p>
