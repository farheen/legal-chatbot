Appellant had made a channel-shape pattern grid, which he .had hoped could be cast from appellee’s heat-resisting alloy metal on the occasion of appellee’s visit. It appears conclusively from the record that considerable discussion was had at that time between appellant, appellee, and others regarding the melting of appellee’s heat-resisting alloy metal; that appellee explainéd the difficulties incident to casting a channel-shaped resistor grid, and, at this time, suggested to appellant the advisability of casting the resistor grid in the T-form defined in the count in the interference. This seems to be conceded. We quote from appellant’s brief:</p>
    <blockquote id="b126-11" data-blocks='[["BL_126.12",126,[251,2296,1319,200]]]'>And, it being admitted by Cope that Fahrenwald suggested the T shape of his enameling bar for use in a resistor grid after Cope had devised a channel section for the grid, it is only necessary to consider the facts which are conceded or established, as far as they have a bearing on the questions of law relied upon. * * *</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b127-3" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[105,372,1324,616]]]'>Fahrenwald prior to Cope’s earliest work in tlie field of bar resistor grids had made resistor grids of the type of Exhibit 1 which answered every part of count 2 except the specification ■ of the T-shaped cross section. It is true the suggestion came at a conference based on grid forms proposed by Cope with Fahrenwald present merely as an expert in casting, particularly in; casting his own alloys. Nevertheless he was under no such fiduciary relation to Cope as would cause to inure to Cope’s benefit under the employer-employee doctrine any invention which was ancillary to Cope’s invention if it were also ancillary to his own. The evidence is clearly to the effect that grids of the type of Exhibit 1 are difficult to cast out of high temperature allows [alloys] and that bars of T Section are simpler to cast. The T form is therefore as much an improvement on grids like Exhibit 1 invented by Fahrenwald as it is of a grid of channel form such as was made by Cope prior to July, 1922, and suggested to Fahrenwald by him at that time. Count 2 will therefore be adjudged to Fahrenwald.</blockquote>

    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[105,1118,1324,694]]]'>It is contended by connsel for appellant that Fahrenwald’s suggestion of the T-shaped grid was merely that of a metallurgic foundry expert, whose advice was sought and obtained by appellant for the sole purpose of aiding him in casting resistor grids from the heat-resisting alloy metal of appellee; that, while the “ T form ” was a valuable addition, it was ancillary and subordinate to appellant’s generic invention — the channel-shaped grid; and that, as appellee was present for the sole purpose of aiding and advising appellant in the use of the heat-resisting alloy metal, any valuable additions to appellant’s generic invention, suggested by appellee, would inure to appellant’s benefit under the so-called employer-employee doctrine; and that, therefore, the tribunals of the Patent Office erred in awarding priority of invention to appellee. Several cases have been cited by counsel for appellant in support of his contention.</p>
    <p id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.7",127,[105,1819,1324,333]]]'>If the parties occupied the relation of employer and employee, and if Fahrenwald was present for the purpose of putting Cope’s invention into practical form, any valuable additions, not in themselves amounting to invention, would inure to the benefit of Cope. <em>Larson </em>v.

This view of the facts seems to be confirmed, to some extent at least, by a written license agreement entered into by the Electric Furnace Co. (of which company appellant was then vice president) with appellee under date of September 1,1922, in which it was agreed that, in consideration of certain sums, as “ royalties,” to be paid to appellee,, appellant’s company should have the exclusive right to the manufacture, use, and sale of appellee’s “ metallic resistors heating elements,” <em>regardless of their composition. </em>The parties thereto operated under this agreement for a considerable length of time. It. would seem strange indeed for appellant’s company to agree to pay royalties for the use of appellee’s metallic resistors, whether or not made of appellee’s heat-resisting alloy metal, if the T-shaped grid was the valuable one and appellant believed that he was the original inventor thereof.</p>
