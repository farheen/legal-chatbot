Moreover, although the immediate effect of the misconduct might have been to benefit Syncor through increased sales and profits, there is no mistaking that the alleged misconduct caused substantial injury to Syncor, which became the focus of multiple criminal and civil proceedings.</p>

      <a id="p998" href="#p998" data-label="998" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*998</a>The conclusion that the claims asserted here are derivative, not direct, is not altered by the fact that, when Fu’s misconduct was ultimately disclosed, an effect of that disclosure was to cause a reduction in the exchange ratio in the Cardinal/Syncor merger agreement. This is merely a coincidental, indirect consequence of Fu’s acts that resulted from the awkward timing of the disclosure. The complaint alleges that Fu’s misconduct directly harmed the plaintiff class and was the direct and proximate cause of the renegotiation of the merger. But the court is not bound to accept these conclusions. Instead, the court must examine the nature of the wrong alleged and make its own determination of whether the misconduct alleged gives rise to a direct claim for relief against Fu by the plaintiffs and the class. Here, as already explained, it is plain that the misconduct alleged involved a duty owed to the corporation and gave rise to injury to that entity. The change in the terms of the then-pending merger agreement simply reflected a change in the market value of Syncor resulting from the public disclosure of Fu’s alleged misconduct and Cardinal’s ability to bargain for a better deal. For those reasons, the claim alleged is derivative in nature and not direct.</p>
