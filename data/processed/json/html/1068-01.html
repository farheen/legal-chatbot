(the Inquirer) and its reporter B.J. Phillips for defamation. His claim stems from a short article Phillips wrote about an altercation at Lincoln University, which briefly mentioned MacElree (then the Chester County District Attorney). The article explored the racial aspects of this incident, and quoted a Lincoln University attorney as calling MacElree “the David Duke of Chester County.” R.R. 19a.</p>
    <p id="b1127-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1127.17",1127,[1027,428,756,936]]]'>The article appeared in the November 1, 1991, edition of the Philadelphia Inquirer. In it, Phillips described a strange melee between Lincoln students and some visiting students from New York. Apparently, the New York students arrived at the Lincoln campus and headed for a dormitory, looking for girls. Fights broke out, and the visitors were taken into custody by campus police. Then a mob of fifty to a hundred Lincoln students gathered and stormed the campus police office and attacked the visitors. The article described them as a resembling a lynch mob without a rope. They beat up four of the New Yorkers; “one was stabbed and his shoulder dislocated.” The article focused on the ironic fact that both the New York visitors and the mob of Lincoln students who attacked them were African-American. R.R. 18a-19a.</p>

The trial court disagreed that a reasonable reader would have gotten that impression from the article. The trial court considered the lone remark, taken in context, to be more like a “verbal slap in the face.” As such it was not actionable as defamation, so the court sustained the newspaper’s preliminary objections and dismissed the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We agree with Judge Cohen’s excellent opinion, and affirm.</p>

The strength of the image invites use. To obtain emotional impact, orators employed the term without strong justification, shading its meaning just a little. So long as any part of the old meaning lingers, there is a tendency to invoke the word for its impact rather than to convey a precise <a id="p1072" href="#p1072" data-label="1072" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1072</a>meaning.

While Judge MacElree also asserts that the use of the term "electioneering” defamed him, he nowhere explains how. Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines "electioneer” as "to take an active part in an election; <em>specif: </em>to work for the campaign of a candidate or party." As a district attorney running for judge, the comment that MacElree was electioneering was neither defamatory nor false. The comment can have a negative connotation only when taken together with the David Duke comparison.</p>

Contrary to the argument in MacElree’s reply brief, we think that the recent standards of <em>Milkovich </em>support the trial court’s conclusion that the remark is not actionable defamation. A metaphor is a figure of speech, and one cannot assign truth values to figurative language. A metaphor can only be more or less apt. Indeed, how could MaeElree satisfy the <em>Milkovich </em>test that the metaphor be provable as false? Would he produce other residents of Chester County who are more like David Duke than he is, and thereby show that he is not the David Duke of Chester County? What criteria would a court use to evaluate the similarities? Such a literal interpretation does not capture the intended and commonly understood meaning of the statement. That is why a statement must have a core of objective meaning, or logically entail some set of falsifiable facts, before it enters the realm of actionable defamation. <em>See Milkovich, </em><a href="/us/497/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="497 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6212323" data-case-paths="/us/497/0001-01">497 U.S. at 19-20</a>, <a href="/us/497/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="497 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6212323" data-case-paths="/us/497/0001-01">110 S.Ct. at 2706-07</a>.</p>

The article, taken as a whole, portrays MacElree not in a false light, but a positive light (albeit a dim light, seeing how MacElree was scarcely mentioned). <em>See Curran v.
