In the opinion of the evaluator, whom the [c]ourt found to be wholly credible, the foster parents had an exceptional level of awareness of the children’s individual needs, personalities and idiosyncracies [sic]; fostered speech development; showed affection; and were closely attached to both children. The foster parents have had a significant and supportive relationship with the children’s maternal grandmother and wished to maintain a family relationship with her. The evaluator had no concerns with respect to the foster parents’ parenting skills and was in fact impressed with their enthusiasm, thoroughness, supervision, attention, affection, and concern for these children.
