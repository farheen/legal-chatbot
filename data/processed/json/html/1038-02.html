This action has its origins in a news article pubhshed on June 30, 1985 by Appellant, the Patriot-News Company (“Patriot-News”) concerning a prosecution conducted by Ertel while he was District Attorney for Lycoming County. This 1974 prosecution resulted in a conviction of Kim Lee Hubbard (“Hubbard”) of second degree murder for the death of twelve-year-old Jennifer Hill. Hubbard served ten years in prison for the Hill murder.</p>

After Hubbard was released from prison, he and his parents hired Appellant William C. Costopoulos (“Costopoulos”) to review the trial in an effort to clear Hubbard’s name. Costopoulos studied the case and wrote a twenty-seven page report (the “Costopoulos Report”). He then submitted this report to the Hubbards. The Hubbards, in turn, deliv<a id="p1040" href="#p1040" data-label="1040" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1040</a>ered a copy of the Costopoulos Report to Appellant, Dick Sarge (“Sarge”), a reporter for the PatrioiANews who had written previous articles about the case.

The June 30th article stated that the Costo-poulos Report had found the following aberrations in the 1974 prosecution:</p>

Police said the cast was taken from the field near where the body was discovered, and that it matched a tire on Hubbard’s car. Yet evidence established that the tire, which was on Hubbard’s car when he was arrested, was purchased and installed after the murder. Moreover, the tire cast clearly reproduced lettering from the tire sidewall. A tire moving through a muddy field would not leave legible traces of sidewall lettering. From this, Costopoulos concluded that “[t]he only logical conclusion to be drawn is that [the tire cast in question] was fabricated.” R. 355a.</blockquote>

First, since Costopoulos agrees with Ertel’s account of Sarge’s statement, there is no issue of fact. Second, Costopoulos is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Taking Sarge’s statement in the light most favorable to Ertel as the non-moving party, this evidence at best <a id="p1044" href="#p1044" data-label="1044" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1044</a>shows that Costopoulos did not act to prevent Sarge from writing his article, and the <em>Patrioi-News </em>from publishing it. This evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to show that Costopoulos procured the publication of the June 30th article. Costopoulos did not affirmatively act to direct or participate in the publication of the June 30th article; rather, he merely failed to hinder its publication.
