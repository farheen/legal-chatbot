    <p id="b757-4" data-blocks='[["BL_757.5",757,[170,362,755,1559]]]'>The pertinent facts can be summarized as follows. On June 3, 2005, the Columbia County Board of Assessment increased its assessment of two parcels Berwick owns that comprise a shopping mall in Berwick Borough. The Board re-evaluated the parcels’ market value and concluded that the value had increased. Based upon those conclusions, the Board increased the tax assessment for the parcels. The previous assessments for the two parcels were $263,380 and $385,870, totaling $649,250. The Board’s new assessment was, respectively, $432,679 and $635,115, for a total of $1,067,794. Berwick appealed those assessments and the Board denied the appeals on October 3, 2005. In appealing that decision to the trial court, Berwick raised two issues: (1) whether the assessment constitutes an impermissible spot assessment, and (2) whether the Board’s determination of the property’s market value was excessive. The trial court held a hearing on the appeal and determined that the fair market value of the parcels should be set at $2,575,000, with a corresponding tax assessment of $790,525.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, the trial court failed to address Berwick’s contention that the Board’s action constitutes improper spot assessment, which is the sole issue Berwick raises now.</p>

Although Columbia County is a county of the Sixth Class, our Supreme Court has held that the definitions in the Second Class A and Third Class County Assessment Law apply to all counties under the General County Assessment Law, Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, <em>as amended, </em>72 P.S. § 5020-104. <em>Groner v.

The Borough argues that, although the reassessment was not part of a county-wide reassessment, Berwick offered no evidence as to whether the reassessment created, sustained, or increased disproportionality among assessed values. We do not believe we need to confront the Borough’s argument. Although Berwick couched its issue in terms of spot assessment, the Court must primarily address the question of whether, under the Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law, the Board improperly reassessed Berwick’s property.</p>
