It is also true that in the claim at issue and the illustrative drawing Figure 6 it is shown that there is proposed an outer driving gear which is to mesh with the internal gear “ so as to drive the drum in the manner set forth in the description of the hoisting mechanism.” We are not convinced, however, that it is inventive merely to place certain of the gears outside rather than having them all inclosed, particularly in view of the fact that this causes no alteration in the final result.</p>
    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.5",53,[101,1056,1326,1341]]]'>It seems to the court that there is a degree of indefiniteness in claim 30 which is confusing. The specific language to which we refer is “A hoisting mechanism comprising rotatable drum means, a motor therefor having a housing rotatable therewith.” Does this mean that the housing rotates with the drum or with the motor? Appellant insists that it means the drum and the examiner seems to have so interpreted it and held that the limitation was immaterial. The board points out that “ the claim does not make it clear whether the motor rotates with the drum or not,” but adds that “the motor of the reference would operate if it were connected to the drum instead of to the frame.” The reference is to the German patent, supra, to Howell, 660686, October 30, 1900, and to Benson, 131425, June 23,1903. Upon the whole language of the claim we are content to take appellant’s interpretation as understood bj*- the examiner and construe the language to mean a “ motor whose housing is rotatable with the drum.” Appellant insists that under this construction the Howell patent is obviously irrelevant, and we think this is correct, since the Howell motor appears to be one which drives a drum by means of reduction gearing contained within the drum. In the German patent, however, it appears that there is member <em>s, </em>the left portion of which constitutes a housing for the motor <em>m </em>and that this motor housing is rotatable with the drums, and the examiner considered the combination in claim 30 unpatentable over the German patent on the ground that a. motor like that in Benson might be substituted for the German patent, while the board holds out the idea that the motor m of the German patent might be connected to the drum instead of the frame.</p>

      <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>Appellant argues upon these points that the patent to Benson discloses an engine carried by standards; that each of the valve shafts is provided with a pinion; that these pinion mesh with stationary gear; and that there is not the slightest suggestion from the patents themselves of replacing the motor of the German patent by a rotary engine of the type disclosed by Benson, which is adapted to drive a belt passed around its casing and has no arrangement for driving a set of gearing. He further insists that it would be a fundamental change in the hoisting mechanism of the German patent to connect the motor to the drum instead of to the frame, and that, even if the change were made, far-reaching alterations would have to be made or else there would be no possibility of driving the drum.</p>
    <p id="b54-4" data-blocks='[["BL_54.4",54,[235,858,1321,334]]]'>From our study and analysis of the drawings, processes of operation, etc., of the application and references, we have concluded that under the interpretation which we place upon claim 30 as to it being “ limited to a motor whose housing is rotatable with the drum,” we believe appellant’s contentions are well founded and hold that No. 30 presents a patentable claim, and we think that No. 31 is so closely related to 30 as that it should also be allowed.</p>
    <p id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[238,1209,1320,142]]]'>Claim 43 was rejected on either Abbe or Davenport, and we think correctly so, for practically the same reasons given in passing upon claim 28 and which will not be here repeated.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[236,1358,1321,195]]]'>In passing upon claims 59 and 61, which were rejected on Benson, Backstrom, Holmes, McNamara, and also as defining only a fragment of an invention (referring to <em>Jay </em>v. Weinberg, <a href="/f/250/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="250 F. 469" data-case-ids="6739680" data-case-paths="/f/250/0469-01">250 Fed. 469</a>), the Board of Patent Appeals said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b54-7" data-blocks='[["BL_54.7",54,[237,1578,1320,284]]]'>We understand these claims to relate to the intersection of the two bores for the rotors of the motor as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The arrangement is the same as in Figure 2 of Holmes or Figure 2 of the Backstrom and to merely embody this motor as a part of the hoisting drum would not involve invention. These claims do not even define the function of the bores nor include anything cooperating therewith, and there is nothing inventive in forming two intersecting bores in a hoisting drum or anything else.</blockquote>
    <p id="b54-8" data-blocks='[["BL_54.8",54,[238,1886,1320,237]]]'>We agree with the board as to these claims. Examination of the decisions and authorities cited by appellant, and analyzing them along with those cited by the Solicitor for the Patent Office, leads us to the conclusion that appellant’s contention as to these claims is not well founded.</p>
    <p id="b54-9" data-blocks='[["BL_54.9",54,[239,2136,1319,137]]]'>In accordance with this opinion the decision of the Board of Appeals is <em>affirmed </em>as to all claims at issue except Nos. 30 and 31, and as to these it is <em>reversed.</em>
