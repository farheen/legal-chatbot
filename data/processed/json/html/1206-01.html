Our standard of review on an appeal from the grant of summary judgment is settled: a reviewing court may disturb the order of the trial court “only where it is established that the court committed an error of law or abused its discretion.” Ca<em>pek v.

In evaluating the trial court’s decision to enter summary judgment, we focus on the legal standard articulated in the summary judgment rule, Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2. The rule states that “where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to relief as a matter of law, summary judgment may be entered.” <em>Young v.

A “covered claim” is defined as “an unpaid claim ... which arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this article applies issued by an insurer if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after the effective date of this article.” 40 P.S. § 991.1802. PIGA has the duty “to pay covered claims,” and “any obligation of the association to defend an insured shall cease upon the association’s payment or tender of an amount equal to the lesser of the association’s covered claim obligation or the applicable policy limit.” 40 P.S. § 991.1803(b)(l)(i).

The dispute in this matter is in regard to the amount payable under the claim. Appellants argue that had the Physicians Insurance Company not become insolvent, it would have been obligated to pay the Feldmans the $200,000 policy limit and, additionally, a proportionate share of the delay damages and post-judgment interest. They note that the statute creating the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund (hereinafter “CAT Fund”) states that in addition to the CAT Fund’s responsibility to pay delay damages and post-judgment interest, the basic insurance carrier is also responsible for its proportionate share., Appellant’s Brief, at 7; 40 P.S. § 1301.702®. Additionally, appellants note that Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 238 provides that “at the request of a plaintiff in a civil action seeking monetary relief for bodily injury ... damages for delay shall be awarded to the amount of compensatory damages against each defendant found to be liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of the jury ... and shall become part of the verdict.”</p>

First, we note that the CAT Fund is not implicated, or otherwise interested, in the current declaratory action, and as such, the statutes pertaining to the CAT Fund are not applicable in the present matter.</p>
    <p id="b1249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1249.4",1249,[141,600,755,1643]]]'>¶ 11 Appellants’ other claim, that had the Physicians Insurance Company not become insolvent, it would have been obligated to pay the Feldmans the $200,000 policy limit as well as a proportionate share of the delay damages and post-judgment interest, is not necessarily true. This Court, interpreting Pa.R.C.P 238, has held that if delay damages “are found owing, the plaintiff may collect them from the defendant only. There is no provision for shifting liability to an insurer who has the sole right to conduct the defense.” <em>Hall v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa-super/363/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="363 Pa.

The Court held that “where the [insurer] has paid the limits of its policy, its liability may be enlarged provided [a showing] in a subsequent action that it breached its duty to act in good faith.” <em><a href="/pa-super/363/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="363 Pa. Super. 415" data-case-ids="672574" data-case-paths="/pa-super/363/0415-01">Id.</a> </em>The <em>Hall </em>court went on to note: “it is clear that a determination that an insurance carrier is liable for delay damages, even under [a] more discretionary and fault-based analysis, is something less than a finding that the carrier acted in bad faith.” <em><a href="/pa-super/363/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="363 Pa.
