Nelson and Arrington who “won’t let her go,” appellant was overheard stating: “I don’t mind shooting somebody if I have to.” In the trunk of appellant’s car was a rifle bag containing a shotgun and two handguns, which appellant loaded upon arriving in the District, giving one pistol with ammunition to Mr. Calloway while keeping the shotgun and the other pistol for himself.</p>

After a brief conversation, Mr. Arrington opened the door and peeped out. At that moment, Halicki jumped to the side and Arrington, sensing trouble, slammed the door shut. Appellant fired two shotgun blasts through the door, striking Mr. Ar-rington in the arm and back. Mr. Arring-ton ran toward Mr. Nelson’s room and informed Mr. Nelson that he had been shot and that the shooter was coming through the front door. While Nelson leapt from his bed and closed the bedroom door, Ar-rington hid in the closet. Appellant then fired a shotgun blast through the bedroom door hitting Nelson, entered the room, and began interrogating Nelson about Denise Mitchell’s whereabouts. Although Nelson insisted that he did not know and pleaded for his life, appellant reloaded one of the guns and fired three more times. Mr. Nelson died from his wounds.</p>

The trial court sentenced appellant to concurrent terms of incarceration of twenty years to life on the premeditated murder and the felony murder convictions, respectively. The judge, apparently concerned that the armed burglary conviction would merge into the felony murder conviction, did not impose a sentence on the armed burglary conviction. We have held that "where one killing is involved, and the government advances alternate theories of felony murder based upon more than one underlying felony, the accused may not be convicted of more than one felony murder.” <em>Wright </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/a2d/513/0804-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="513 A.2d 804" data-case-ids="7931090" data-case-paths="/a2d/513/0804-01">513 A.2d 804</a>, 805 n. 1 (D.C.1986) (quoting <em>Garris v.

Accordingly, in light of our affirmance of appellant's conviction for first-degree murder, the felony murder conviction must be vacated, and we remand to the trial court to impose sentence for the burglary charge which survives without merger.</p>
