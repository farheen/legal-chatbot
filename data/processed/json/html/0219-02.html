    <p id="b272-8" data-blocks='[["BL_272.9",272,[180,953,748,698]]]'>Defendant Edward L. Benner appeals from his conviction of unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs following his entry of a conditional guilty plea after the Superior Court (Knox County, <em>Silsby, J.) </em>denied his motion to dismiss the indictment. He argues on appeal that the legislative definition of “unlawful trafficking”, which includes “to grow or to cultivate”, (17-A M.R.S.A. § 1101(17)(B) (1983 &amp; Supp. 1988-1989)), conflicts with common understanding of the term “trafficking” and thus unfairly stigmatizes him in violation of the due process guarantees of both the Maine and United States Constitutions.</p>

    <blockquote id="b272-11" data-blocks='[["BL_272.12",272,[215,2261,710,325]]]'>It seems to us that the interest of the legislature is paramount in the field of penology and the public safety.
