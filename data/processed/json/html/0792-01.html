The jury had a right to conclude from the evidence that plaintiff’s intestate was dying. It could have concluded he desired not to be photographed in his hospital bed in such condition and that he manifested such desire by his physical motions. The jury should have been instructed, if it found these facts, that the taking of pictures without decedent’s consent or over his objection was an invasion of his legally protected right to privacy, which invasion was an actionable tort for which money damages could be recovered.</p>

As earlier indicated, the presiding justice announced as his conclusion that consent to a battery is implied from the existence of a physician-patient relationship. While we do not acknowledge the correctness of this pronouncement by the justice presiding because in our view it is so broad as to be <a id="p796" href="#p796" data-label="796" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*796</a>inaccurate, even if the statement were true, the action taken by the presiding justice was not legally justified. It was based on a major premise that a physician-patient relationship existed at the time of the actions complained of. The jury had not yet had the opportunity to decide if such a relationship had been established. The evidence in the case at the time of the justice’s action clearly established that plaintiff’s intestate was under the care of another physician. The patient had been referred to appellee for surgery on two occasions. The only other occasion for direct contact with the patient occurred substantially before the alleged invasion of the right to privacy when appellee examined plaintiff’s intestate preliminarily to giving his opinion to the attending physician only as to the advisability of proposed therapy. There is nothing to suggest that the appel-lee’s visit to plaintiff’s intestate’s room on the day of the alleged invasion of privacy was for any purpose relating to the <em>treatment </em>of the patient. Appellee acknowledges that his sole purpose in going to the Berthiaume hospital room and the taking of pictures was to conclude the making of a photographic record to complete appel-lee’s record of the case. From the evidence, then, it is apparent that the jury had a right to conclude that the physician-patient relationship once existing between Dr. Pratt and Henry Berthiaume, the deceased, had terminated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

It should have been instructed that consent to a touching of the body of a patient may be implied from the patient’s consent to enter into a physician-patient relationship whenever such touching is reasonably necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient’s ailments while the physician-patient relationship continues. Quite obviously also, there would be no actionable assault and battery if the touching was expressly consented to. Absent express consent by the patient or one authorized to give consent on the patient’s behalf, or absent consent implied from the circumstances, including the physician-patient relationship, the touching of the patient in the manner described by the evidence in this case would constitute assault and battery if it was part of an undertaking which, in legal effect, was an invasion of plaintiff’s intestate’s “right to be let alone.”</p>

The evidence discloses that the appellee had taken photographs at various stages during the course of Berthiaume’s fatal illness and had made these photographs a part of appellee’s medical record of the case. It is argued that by looking at Ber-thiaume’s photographs appellee would be better able to evaluate and predict the progress of a malignancy of the same type and nature in other patients similarly afflicted. We are urged to declare as a matter of law that it was the physician’s right to complete the photographic record by capturing on film Berthiaume’s appearance in his final dying hours, even without the patient’s consent or over his objections.

An analogy to the laws of libel, however, is not justified under the circumstances of this case. The author of a libel is the creator and there can be no offense until the contents are communicated to another. One cannot invade the rights of another merely by expressing his thoughts on paper. Two persons are necessary. One’s right of privacy, however, may be invaded by a single human agency. Plaintiff’s picture was taken without her authority or consent. Her right to decide whether her facial characteristics should be recorded for another’s benefit or by reason of another’s capriciousness has been violated. The scope of the authorization defines the extent of the acts necessary to constitute a violation.
