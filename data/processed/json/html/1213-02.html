He had left the back door of the truck open. No attempt was made to retrieve the newspapers because the bundle had broken open. Guaracino called the company to report the loss and to request credit for the lost papers so that he would not have to pay for the papers himself.

Because Guaracino was behind schedule, the truck driver who delivered the newspapers to the site had left the bundles on the ground.

Dr. Byron did not find any evidence of major depression recurrent in nature. He stated that Guaraci-no’s complaints were consistent with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, but found it incongruous that Guaraeino would have reacted with overwhelming emotional decom-pensation to the events of May 1,1990, given his proven leadership in an aggressive and demanding work milieu and prior criminal conviction.</p>

PNI contends that a single episode of criticism by a supervisor who uses vulgar language may be regrettable and crude but is not an extraordinary event. Guaracino responds that the use of obscenities by a supervisor should not be tolerated in the work place and that a supervisor’s position of authority should be considered in deciding whether particular events constitute abnormal working conditions.</p>

    <p id="b1281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1281.4",1281,[149,618,755,941]]]'>The Commonwealth Court essentially has identified two different impetuses that trigger psychic injury in the absence of a physical stimulus — either a specific extraordinary event or abnormal working conditions of a longer duration. The parties interpret this “objective test” as supplementing the standard of proof established in <em>Martin </em>for claimants seeking benefits for psychic injury resulting from mental stimulus. However, we do not view the Commonwealth Court’s description of psychic injuries as emanating from either a specific extraordinary event or abnormal working conditions over time to establish an additional standard or burden of proof. Although it has been referred to by the Commonwealth Court as an objective test, the description is merely an exemplification of <em>Martin. </em>The <em>Martin </em>standard is unchanged.</p>

In assessing whether work conditions are abnormal, we must recognize that the work environment is a microcosm of society. It is not a shelter from rude behavior, obscene language, incivility, or stress. While we do not suggest that insensitive behavior is socially acceptable in the work place, it is unrealistic to expect that such behavior will not occur. Where, as here, the evidence demonstrates that the offensive behavior complained of is an isolated incident, we must conclude that an abnormal working condition has not been established.</p>

In <em>Archer, </em>the claimant was employed at a General Motors’ warehouse. Her responsibilities included the use of an electric crane to gather parts from storage areas and place them on a conveyor belt. The claimant introduced evidence that her supervisor had repeatedly criticized her work performance and harassed her over the time period from October 1984 to March 1985. She testified that the supervisor reprimanded her for conduct that was typical among her peers and continually accused her of not working even when she had completed all assigned tasks. She also testified that the supervisor followed her around the plant and watched her constantly. The claimant indicated that she had been singled out for such treatment.</p>

The Board reversed, concluding that the claimant had not met the requisite burden of proof because she had failed to offer any corroborating evidence to support her allegations of harassment.</p>

In <em>McDonough, </em>the claimant was employed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation as a traffic control technician. He testified that from 1962 until 1970, his superior continually singled him out for criticism in the presence of other personnel. The psychologist who treated the claimant diagnosed him as suffering from panic disorder, anxiety, and dependent personality disorder and opined that his work experience was a substantial cause of the psychic injury. The referee denied the claim for benefits because he found that the medical evidence was insufficient to establish that there was a causal connection between the claimant’s condition and his employment. The Board affirmed, noting that even if the claimant’s employment caused his disability, it was merely a subjective reaction to normal conditions.</p>

He argues that it is essential that we find significant harassment on one occasion which causes psychic injury to be compensable, or otherwise employers will have free reign to harass employees. We are unpersuaded that rejection of Guaracino’s argument will encourage employers to harass employees or to unleash a barrage of profanity in the work place. Furthermore, we note that inappropriate behavior of supervisors that does not constitute an abnormal working condition may best be redressed within the confines of the work environment itself, rather than remedied by the system of workers’ compensation benefits.</p>
