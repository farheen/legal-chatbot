By virtue of a court order dated May 5, 1995 awarding temporary legal and physical custody of Paul Diveglia II to Gloria Larson, the child resides with appellee and his wife, Gloria Larson, who is the sister of appellant.

This entire argument rests upon the assumption that appellee, in fact, has physical control of the child because the child resides in his home and appellee’s spouse has legal and physical custody of the child. That assumption reads more into the record of this case than exists. The court order awarding temporary legal and physical custody to Gloria Larson does not confer any legal rights upon appellee. It would be just as logical to assume <em>from the </em>absence of appellee’s name in the custody order that it would not be in the best interests of the child to confer any legal rights upon appellee on behalf of the child.</p>

The rules governing support actions do not require such a result and the majority’s decision goes against the best interests of a child who has no legal custodian protecting him.</p>
    <p id="b998-13" data-blocks='[["BL_998.17",998,[995,1363,752,470]]]'>As recognized by the majority, standing to bring an action for child support is governed by Rule of Civil Procedure 1910.3. Relevant to this case, Rule 1910.3 states that a support action shall be brought “on behalf of a minor child by a person having custody of the minor, without appointment as guardian ad li-tem.” Pa. R. Civ. P.1910.3(2). Thus, Appel-lee has standing to seek support if he has custody of Appellant’s child.</p>

      <a id="p935" href="#p935" data-label="935" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*935</a>The Rules of Civil Procedure governing support actions do not define custody. Where a legal custodian fails to seek child support from a natural parent, Rule 1910.3 does not preclude another custodian from protecting the child and seeking support on his behalf. Rule 1910.3 simply confers standing upon a person with custody. As it is undisputed that Appellant’s child resides with Appellee and Appellee financially supports him, Appellee has <em>de facto </em>physical custody and thus has standing. Appellee also has <em>defacto </em>physical custody by virtue of the court’s award of physical custody to his wife.</p>
    <p id="b999-4" data-blocks='[["BL_999.4",999,[175,985,755,574]]]'>The majority relies upon the definition of custody found in the rules governing claims for custody, partial custody and visitation. <em>See </em>Pa. R. Civ. P.1915.1(a),(b)(setting forth scope of rules and definitions of words used in chapter governing custody claims). In this context, custody is defined as the legal right to care for a child and includes legal, physical and shared custody. <em><a href="/pa-super/398/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="398 Pa.
