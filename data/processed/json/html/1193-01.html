Earned Capital would execute agreements of sale by which individuals purchased fractional interests in premises, specifically, townhouse residential units owned by Canterbury Village. These agreements of sale guaranteed each individual purchaser a specified annual rate of return on the investment, calculated as a percentage of the purchase price paid by the purchaser for a fractional share of the property. A third corporation, Managed Properties, Inc., managed the properties on behalf of Earned Capital and was responsible for distributing the guaranteed annual percentage payments to the purchasers.</p>

As a result, Earned Capital transferred to Managed Properties additional funds generated by the sale of new interests in the Seven Fields properties, which were in turn used to pay the returns due to earlier purchasers. Because the sale of each new interest carried with it an obligation for payment of a guaranteed annual return to the purchaser, however, Earned Capital had to market new sales to cover payments due to prior purchasers, even after 100% of the available interests in the Seven Fields properties had been sold.</p>

Subsequent thereto, Arthur Young <em>&amp; </em>Company, the predecessor of Ernst &amp; Young, was retained to gather and take control of the debtor corporations’ records and to summarize the financial information in those records onto work papers for use in the bankruptcy proceedings. The disorder of the corporate records, however, prevented an exact determination of the liabilities of the debtor corporations, such that the liability figures included in the petitions had to be estimated. Additionally, the disarray or absence of corporate records prevented an exact attribution of what debt belonged to which debtor corporation.</p>

On January 13, 1999, the Reillys filed an amended complaint, asserting individual claims for professional negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy against Ernst &amp; Young, in relation to its efforts to summarize the debtor corporations’ -records and financial information for use in the prior bankruptcy proceedings. The Reillys alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young had failed to make an accurate assessment of the debtor corporations’ assets and liabilities, had mischaracterized substantial equity as debt, had failed to accurately determine which assets were owned by the four respective debtor corporations, and had failed to correct these errors even after it had received information to the contrary. <em>See </em>Amended Complaint, 01/13/99, at ¶ 25.</p>

Thereafter, on July 10, 2000, Ernst &amp; Young filed a motion to withdraw the deemed admissions, which the trial court subsequently granted on August 23, 2000. In so doing, the trial court reasoned that deeming Ernst &amp; Young to have admitted the Reillys’ RFAs would “practically guarantee a finding of negligence on the part of Defendants, which is Plaintiffs’ primary claim in this matter” and would “practically eliminate any presentation of the merits of the case.” Trial Court Opinion, 8/23/00, at 6.

Additionally, the Court notes that Defendants were given the opportunity, by the Court, to file their answers despite failing to timely respond to Plaintiffs Requests, or to request an extension of time from the Court, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. As such, the Court finds it would be unjust to allow Defendants to have a third chance to properly file their answers.

      <em>governing </em>RFAs, does not, on its face, address how verifications are to be handled when multiple defendants respond jointly to a single set of RFAs. However, Rule 1024(c) provides guidance as it relates to the verification of pleadings. Specifically, Rule 1024(c) provides, with respect to pleadings, that “[t]he verification shall be made by <em>one or more </em>of the parties filing the pleading.” Pa.R.Civ.P., Rule 1024(c), 42 Pa. Cons. StatANN. (emphasis added). Although Rule 1024 speaks only of verifications of pleadings, this Court has held that the terms of Rule 1024 are applicable to all documents requiring a verification, on the ground that there is “no reason why practice regulating a matter as common and collateral to all proceedings as verification should not be uniform in all cases.” <em>See Monroe Contract Corp. v. Harrison Square, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/266/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="266 Pa.

This Court further recognized that “verification is necessary to defend a party against spurious allegations; it <em>must not be transformed into an offensive weapon </em>designed to strike down an otherwise valid petition.” <em>Id., </em>at 958 (emphasis added). Additionally, we stated that “while we do not, of course, condone willful noncompliance with our procedural rules, a hypertechnical reading of each clause, and a blind insistence on precise, formal adherence, benefits neither the judicial system nor those utilizing that system.” <em>Id. </em>Rather, in the situation facing the Court in <em>Monroe Contract Corp., </em>we held that “at a bare minimum, a court confronted by a defective verificátion should grant leave to amend before dismissing the petition.” <em>Id., </em>at 959.</p>
    <p id="b1249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1249.7",1249,[975,360,761,1185]]]'>¶ 22 Applying the principles enunciated in <em>Monroe Contract Corp. </em>to the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is evident that Ernst &amp; Young complied with the mandates for verification such that the Reillys suffered minimum prejudice. As explained above, only one of the two defendants at the time was required to verify defendants’ joint answers and objections to the Reillys’ RFAs. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. Rule 1024(c). Instantly, that verification was provided by Charles Modispacher, the individual in charge of Ernst &amp; Young’s engagement by the debt- or corporations and the individual having sufficient personal knowledge and information with respect to the events at issue. Moreover, a simple amendment to the verification would have sufficed to ameliorate any deficiency caused by Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young’s omission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Accordingly, we do not find that Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young’s noncompliance with the trial court’s discovery order resulted in any significant prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b1249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1249.8",1249,[980,1581,755,404]]]'>¶ 23 There is also no showing of willfulness or bad faith. To the contrary, the record establishes that Ernst &amp; Young substantially complied with the trial court’s order by including one, rather than both verifications; as stated, this was an omission which Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young immediately moved to rectify upon its discovery.</p>
    <p id="b1249-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1249.9",1249,[980,2021,756,401]],["BL_1250.1",1250,[186,232,751,90]]]'>¶24 Lastly, our review of the record fails to convince this Court that Ernst &amp; Young engaged in “repeated” failures to comply with discovery orders. Although it is true that Ernst &amp; Young initially failed to timely respond to the Reillys’ RFAs without requesting an extension of time in which to file, we do not find this default <a id="p1202" href="#p1202" data-label="1202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1202</a>amounts to a repeated failure to comply so as to justify such a severe sanction.</p>
    <p id="b1250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1250.5",1250,[178,362,761,1546]]]'>¶ 25 Based upon our thorough review of the extensive record herein, we are constrained to conclude that the sanction was extremely disproportionate to the noncompliance at issue, in light of the positions taken by the parties and the magnitude of the litigation. By deeming Ernst and Young to have admitted the Reillys’ RFAs — in essence, to have admitted that its alleged wrongdoing caused the Reillys’ loss — the sanction, in effect, relieved the Reillys of their burden of proof at the time of trial to establish the causation and damages elements of their claims for negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation. Specifically, as a result of the sanction, the trial court was able to solely rely upon the deemed admissions to determine that Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young’s actions precipitated the Reillys’ loss of their stock in Canterbury Village and the amount of damages to be awarded to Barbara Reilly. Consequently, upon strict scrutiny of the sanction imposed by the trial court, we find it to have been inappropriate and unwarranted. <em>See Steinfurth, </em><a href="/pa-super/404/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="404 Pa. Super. 384" data-case-ids="895047" data-case-paths="/pa-super/404/0384-01">590 A.2d at 1289</a> (“we strictly scrutinize the appropriateness of the sanction as it produces the harshest result possible and should be imposed only in extreme circumstances”).</p>
