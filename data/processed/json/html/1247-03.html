Hanssens, Jr. as a Democratic Candidate for the Seventh Councilmanic District Seat on Philadelphia’s City Council (hereafter Seventh District). First, I do not believe that the trial court’s April 21, 2003 order complies with this Court’s remand order, which required the trial court to take testimony on the “after-discovered” evidence presented by Hanssens and then to issue new findings of fact and conclusions of law based on that evidence and a new decision. The April 21 decision recites findings of fact and conclusions of law but it offers no discussion of the trial court’s reasoning nor case law or statutory <a id="p1253" href="#p1253" data-label="1253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1253</a>authority for the decision reached.

In the May 2002 primary, Hanssens sought and won election as a Seventh District committeeman, and according to his testimony he planned for several years to run for the that district’s councilmanic seat. However, Hanssens’ Godfrey Avenue property and one other property that he owned were removed from the Seventh District boundary fines during redistricting in 2002. He owned a third piece of property that was located on Griscom Street, which was still located in the Seventh District. Hanssens testified that he moved into the Griscom Street property with the intent of making it his permanent residence, and once the renovations were complete his family would permanently relocate to this property with him later this year and he would put the Godfrey Avenue property up for sale.</p>

The evidence demonstrates a physical presence at the Griscom Street property, a fact which the trial court previously rejected based on the subsequently discredited testimony of a key witness for the objectors, Steve Killian; on remand the trial court found that new evidence called into serious question the reliability of Killian’s testimony. In any event, the evidence further demonstrates Hanssens’ intent to make the new residence on Griscom Street his principal home. The Supreme Court did not require in <em>In re Prendergast </em>nor in any other case that a person in every situation must immediately move his or her family into the new premises, even while renovations are under way, to establish a new domicile.

His true residence was in Berks County nonetheless. The evidence in the case sub judice likewise establishes that Hanssens’ true residence was in the Seventh District.</p>
