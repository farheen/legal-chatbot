On June 20, 2000, Claimant sustained work-related injuries when he tripped over boxes, fell backwards, and landed on a concrete floor. Claimant did not initially miss any time from work due to his work-related injuries, and Employer did not initially issue a Notice of Compensation Payable (NCP). Employer did, however, pay for Claimant’s medical bills. Employer eventually ceased paying Claimant’s physical therapy bills based on the results of a Utilization Review (UR) Determination. Thereafter, Claimant reduced the number of hours that he worked to four hours per day due to increased pain resulting from his inability to obtain physical therapy.</p>

Claimant, through the Modification Petition, sought to obtain partial disability benefits as of September 8, 2003, alleging that his work-related injuries had worsened, and that he had reduced the hours he worked to four hours per day. Employer, through the First Termination Petition, sought to terminate Claimant’s benefits on the basis that Claimant was fully recovered and able to return to unrestricted work as of December 31, 2003. The Modification Petition and First Termination Petition were consolidated, and the matter was assigned to WCJ Sarah Makin (First WCJ) for disposition.

(Harris Dep. at 10, December 4, 2006, R.R. at 100a.) Mr. Harris explained that Employer initially charged Claimant’s accrued sick leave, discretionary leave, or vacation leave for all of the work time that he missed. (Harris Dep. at 10, 53-54, R.R. at 100a, 143a-44a.)

Moreover, Mr. Harris testified that Claimant never contacted Employer regarding the overpayment of benefits (Harris Dep. at 32, August 1, 2007, R.R. at 526a), and he expressed his belief that Claimant should have taken some action to notify Employer that he was receiving more money following his injury than he was prior to his injury. (Harris Dep. at 39, 40-41, December 4, 2006, R.R. at 129a-31a.)

Mr. Sikora stated that AIG stopped paying Claimant benefits on February 16, 2005, after it became aware that Claimant was also receiving his full salary with no charges against his accrued leave. (Sikora Dep. at 11-12, 14, R.R. at 688-89a, 692a.) Mr. Sikora maintained that it was Claimant’s responsibility to contact AIG regarding the overpayment of benefits. (Sikora Dep. at 13, R.R. at 691a.) Mr. Sikora testified that Claimant began receiving total disability benefits again in August of 2006 because he stopped working altogether. (Sikora Dep. at 14-15, R.R. at 692a-93a.)

(Second WCJ Decision, FOF ¶ 8, April 9, 2008.) Based on her own review of the evidence, the Second WCJ found that the June 20, 2000 work incident did not cause Claimant’s stenosis. (FOF ¶ 9.) Instead, the Second WCJ found that Claimant’s work-related injuries were limited to a lumbar strain and sprain and L4-5 radiculopathy. (FOF ¶ 10.) Moreover, based on Dr. Malumed’s credited testimony, the Second WCJ found that Claimant had fully recovered from his lumbar sprain and strain and L4-5 radiculopathy and was <a id="p838" href="#p838" data-label="838" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*838</a>able to return to work without restrictions related to his work injuries as of April 25, 2006.

The Second WCJ further found that: Employer did not “excessively delay[] its pursuit of an offset for the overpayment”; neither Employer nor AIG “fail[ed] to take appropriate steps to prevent the overpayment”; and Claimant would not be prejudiced by Employer’s pursuit of reimbursement of the overpayment. (FOF ¶¶ 65-67.) The Second WCJ also found that AIG “made a mistake in the calculation of the amount of Workers’ Compensation Benefits that were due and owing to the Claimant during the period from February 26, 2004 to February 15, 2005.” (FOF ¶ 68.) Additionally, the Second WCJ found that Employer “had a right to the payment of the paid Workers[’] Compensation Benefits during the period from February 26, 2004 to February 15, 2005 from [AIG] as a reimbursement for its payments in lieu of Workers[’] Compensation Benefits to the Claimant.” (FOF ¶ 69.) Therefore, the Second WCJ concluded that Employer established its right to an offset for the workers’ compensation benefits paid to Claimant during the period from February 26, 2004 to February 15, 2005.

The Board further concluded that Dr. Malumed’s credited testimony was sufficient to support the Second WCJ’s termination of benefits as of April 25, 2006. (Board Op. at 10-11.)</p>

We find it particularly significant that, in summarizing Dr. Lerman’s credited testimony, the First WCJ did not reference any testimony concerning a lumbar sprain and strain. Instead, the First WCJ notes Dr. Lerman’s testimony that Claimant had spurring in his discs resulting in compression of the nerve at L4-5 that admittedly was a pre-existing condition.

Moreover, the First WCJ utilized Dr. Ler-man’s credited testimony as the basis for the denial of Employer’s First Termination Petition, and neither party appealed the First WCJ’s decision and order. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Sinnott, </em>the aggravation of the pre-existing stenosis, as well as the L4-5 radiculopathy, became part of Claimant’s accepted work-related injuries, and the Second WCJ erred in failing to subsequently recognize all of these injuries.</p>

In this case, similar to the employer in <em>Lucey, </em>AIG paid Claimant $22,015.04 in workers’ compensation benefits for the period from February 26, 2004 to February 15, 2005, because it believed that such payments were necessary to fulfill its own obligations, as well as Employer’s obligations, under the Act. However, unbeknownst to AIG, Employer had continued paying Claimant his full salary without charging his accrued leave for that same period. Under Section 306(a.l) of the Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> an employer or insurer is not required to pay total or partial disability benefits for any period “during which the employe is employed and receiving wages equal to or greater than the employee’s prior earnings.” 77 P.S. § 511.1.

Additionally, the apparent breakdown in communication between Employer and AIG does not change the fact that Claimant received both his full salary and workers’ compensation benefits, which is more compensation than he was entitled to receive, and that he failed to provide notice of, and/or return, the overpayment. Claimant’s receipt of both his full salary and workers’ compensation benefits amounts to a double recovery, and Claimant is not entitled to a double recovery under the Act. <em>See General v. E.

Claimant asserts that, in Finding of Fact No. 23, the Second WCJ found Claimant was overpaid with money already owed to him and, thus, there was no basis for granting the Offset Petition. While Finding of Fact No. 23 is not drafted very clearly, we believe such finding is merely summarizing Claimant’s testimony and evidence. In Finding of Fact Nos. 64 through 68, the Second WCJ finds that Claimant was unjustly enriched by the overpayment of benefits attributable to Claimant receiving both his full salary and benefits, and that the conditions necessary to invoke the doctrine of laches had not been satisfied. <em>(See </em>FOF ¶¶ 64-68.) These findings are consistent with the Second WCJ's grant of the Offset Petition. Therefore, we disagree with Claimant’s construction of Finding of Fact No. 23.</p>

Unlike in <em>Henkels &amp; McCoy, </em>the overpayment here was not the result of a conscious decision to continue paying benefits when benefits did not need to be paid. Instead, the overpayment was due a mistaken belief on the part of AIG that it needed to continue paying benefits to Claimant because it had been unaware that Employer was continuing to pay Claimant his full salary without charging his accrued leave. Under these circumstances, Employer and AIG did not have the same opportunity to make use of the remedies that were available to the employer in <em>Henkels &amp; McCoy.</em>

Finding of Fact No. 69 states that "the Judge finds that the Defendant Employer had a right to the payment of the paid Workers['] Compensation Benefits during the period from February 26, 2004 to February 15, 2005 from the Defendant's workers’ compensation insurance carrier as a reimbursement for its payments in lieu of Workers^] Compensation Benefits to the Claimant.” (FOF V 69.) Although this finding is not clear, we believe that the Second WCJ intended to indicate that Employer is entitled to an offset for the benefits paid by AIG for the period of February 26, 2004 through February 15, 2005. This is made evident by the fact that the Second WCJ granted Employer’s Offset Petition.</p>
