Gri-maud, et al., introduces several procedural challenges to the amendment’s enactment, including alleged violations of the amendatory provisions in Article XI of the Pennsylvania <a id="p1254" href="#p1254" data-label="1254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1254</a>Constitution. Appellants, however, did not raise these issues below and have not raised them here. An <em>amicus curiae </em>is not a party and cannot raise issues that have not been raised or preserved by the parties. <em>See </em>Pa. R.A.P. 531(a) <em>(amicus curiae </em>may file brief regarding only those questions that are before the Court). Thus, these issues are not properly before the Court and we therefore decline to address them.</p>

We also cannot agree with Appellants’ contention that Article I, Section 6 vests the right to a jury trial solely in individual defendants. Article I, Section 6 actually reserves this right in the people of the Commonwealth. <em>See Gondelman, </em><a href="/pa/520/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="520 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1815553" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0451-01">520 Pa. at 467</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="520 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1815553" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0451-01">554 A.2d at 904</a> (quoting R. Woodside, <em>Pennsylvania Constitutional Law </em>(1985)) ("The provisions of a constitution specifying the rights reserved and retained by the people are generally referred to as the 'Bill of Rights’ or in Pennsylvania the 'Declaration of Rights' [Article I]”). Here, it was the people of this Commonwealth who voted to support the amendment granting the right to a jury trial to the Commonwealth, which serves as the people’s representative during criminal prosecutions.</p>

We note that even though Appellants were charged in June of 1998, they continued to indicate a desire to be tried by jury until June of 1999, several months after the amendment to Article I, Section 6 passed in November of 1998. (Indeed, Appellants both filed a petition for a change in venue/venire as late as March 1, 1999). It was not until June of 1999— when Appellants requested a waiver trial for the first time on record, and after the amendment had already passed — that the Commonwealth sought to invoke its right to a trial by jury pursuant to the Article I, Section 6 amendment.</p>
