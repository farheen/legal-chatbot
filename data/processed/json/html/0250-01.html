The report set forth the identity of the parties involved and the approximate time, place, cause and circumstances of damage to appellant’s automobile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The report indicated that there were no personal injuries.</p>

The appellee answered denying any liability for the personal injuries alleged. The trial court then, on appellee’s motion, dismissed the complaint, ruling that appellant failed to give the notice of claim mandated by D.C.Code 1973, § 12-309.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[163,1549,748,379]]]'>It is undisputed that the claim for personal injuries was made more than six months after the accident. Nevertheless, appellant insists that the police report (PD 10) of the accident on November 24, 1971, was sufficient notice of his claim for personal injuries to satisfy the requirements of the statute. We disagree and affirm.</p>
    <p id="b289-10" data-blocks='[["BL_289.11",289,[962,232,751,960]]]'>in Brown v. District of Columbia, D.C.App., <a href="/a2d/304/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="304 A.2d 292" data-case-ids="8044125" data-case-paths="/a2d/304/0292-01">304 A.2d 292</a>, 293 (1973), we sought to make it clear that “D.C.Code [1973], § 12-309 contemplates that the ‘report in writing by the Metropolitan Police Department, in regular course of duty,’ shall notify the District of Columbia of an injury to person or damage to property.” In the case at bar the police report (PD 10) was of an automobile accident involving damage to property and gave no notice whatsoever of any personal injury. Appellant argues that the mere existence of <em>any </em>police report of the incident, without regard to its scope or accuracy, satisfies the plain language of the statute so long as it is made in the regular course of duty. However, such a construction of the police report clause of § 12-309 is contrary to the general purpose of the provision as a whole.</p>

The police report is an alternative form of notice added to “[take] care of those instances in which <em>actual notice </em>is had by the District of Columbia from the police department, although technical notice may not have been filed by the person injured.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In order to protect the District against unreasonable claims, the actual notice provided by a police report must contain information as to time, place, cause and circumstances of injury or damage with at least the same degree of specificity required of a written notice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> To require any less would place an intolerable investigative burden on the District of Columbia. It seems needless to say that should we disregard the plain language of the statute as appellant would have us do, the city, in order adequately to protect itself, would be required to investigate every police-reported accident involving a District of Columbia vehicle or facility as if the accident involved serious injuries even when the report reveals no apparent injuries. Because the District of Columbia is not an insurer, a police report must do more than merely report the happening of an event or accident; it must also report — give notice of —any then apparent injury to person which later forms the basis of a claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> As pointed out above, the police report in the instant case gave notice only of property damage and therefore did not suffice to give the city notice of personal injury allegedly resulting from the same accident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

    <p id="b290-8" data-blocks='[["BL_290.9",290,[1027,447,745,368]]]'>Appellant’s estoppel argument is without merit. The notice requirements of the statute are mandatory for maintaining an action against the District for unliquidated damages,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and there is no waiver <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> by the District of such notice either alleged in, or apparent on the face of, the record.</p>

When it does not because no injuries are then apparent, it is the duty of the plaintiff to supply that additional information when it becomes apparent. This holding is, as it should be, limited to the facts of this case. There is no contention that the alleged injuries did not manifest themselves until after the critical six months’ period. Plaintiff merely averred that the injuries became apparent “after the time of the accident”. Therefore, we do not decide what effect the statutory notice requirement would have on an unknown or unknowable injury coming to light after expiration of the six months’ period. Consequently, the police report relied upon in this case indicating, as it does, <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>that there were no personal injuries is insufficient on its face as notice of a personal injury claim made by appellant almost two years later.
