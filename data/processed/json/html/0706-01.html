Defendant refused to waive extradition and remained in prison in default of the bond set for the fugitive warrant. Dur•ing the period of approximately six months that defendant was incarcerated in Pennsylvania, the State of Delaware failed to perfect its rendition. As a result the de-tainer was dismissed and defendant was released from the bond set on the Delaware warrant. The State has given no explanation accounting for this action. In January, 1976, defendant was released from prison, the Pennsylvania charges having been dropped.

When sentence is delayed unnecessarily, the defendant and others are not impressed with the swiftness of justice, and goals such as punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation are not served.

The delay was clearly unnecessary, and invites the assumption of prejudice. <em>Third, </em>the Court attaches relatively little significance to defendant’s failure to assert his right to prompt sentencing (and his earlier refusal to waive extradition) in that (a) if defendant is to be believed, he had no reason to demand sentencing since he believed that his case was closed, or (b), if not, a knowing failure to assert his right is at least as likely to have been a product of fear of incarceration as lack of prejudice. <em>Fourth, </em>defendant has been reincarcerated as a result of a chance identity check and faces sentencing some three years after being released on account of abandoned extradition procedures.

As such, the circumstances here can readily be distinguished from those in <em>Johnson v.

While the defendant there claimed to have made some effort to have his Delaware sentence imposed while imprisoned in Virginia, he subsequently abandoned such efforts and sought to frustrate imposition of sentence.
