We accept the Board’s recommendation of disbarment based upon its thorough, painstakingly considered report — adopting for the most part the likewise meticulous findings of fact by Hearing Committee No. One— which we append to this opinion. Our brief ensuing discussion assumes familiarity with the Board’s report. In the second, unrelated matter before us (No. 06-BG-1480), the Board recommends that respondent be suspended for thirty days for misconduct involving her failure, for years after the death of her client William Dickerson, to locate and file with the court the original Will she had drafted on his behalf and which named her as the personal representative. Here, too, we accept the Board’s recommendation; we discuss this matter briefly in footnote 2, <em>infra.</em>

She argues that the Board, and implicitly the Hearing Committee, applied the preponderance of evidence standard to resolve the key factual issue of whether her client (Green) gave her the $2,000 to pay attorney’s fees owed her (as respondent contends) or instead entrusted her with that money for use on his behalf (as the Board and Hearing Committee found). Thus, in respondent’s view, the Board ignored Bar Counsel’s obligation to prove misconduct, including the core factual allegations underlying the charged misconduct, by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

We agree with respondent that at least the pivotal “threshold issue” here (the Board’s term) of whether respondent received and held the $2,000 in trust for Green required proof by clear and convincing evidence before it could be answered affirmatively. However, none of this helps respondent for the following reasons.</p>

Furthermore, it is not at all apparent from the Hearing Committee’s report that it applied only a preponderance of the evidence standard in finding that respondent received — indeed, knew she had received — the $2,000 in trust for her client. Rather, the Committee stated explicitly at the onset its understanding that “clear and convincing evidence” was the applicable standard of proof. It then arrayed in detail (as did the Board in its report) the evidence of respondent’s own contemporaneous conduct demonstrating, in the Committee’s view, both that the entire $2,000 had been entrusted to respondent as client property and that she knew this to be the case. Respondent points to nothing in the Committee’s analysis suggesting that it applied a lesser <em>(i.e., </em>preponderance) standard of proof in finding incredible her defense that she had received the money in payment of attorney’s fees.</p>

Bar Counsel excepts from the Board's refusal to recommend a showing of fitness as a condition of reinstatement in No. 06-BG-1480, but concedes that this issue is moot if we order disbarment in the Green matter. Bar Counsel also contests the Board's refusal to find in No. 06-BG-1480, that respondent had violated Rule 1.15(a) (safekeeping property) of the Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to properly safeguard her client’s original Will. Although the issue is a close one, and the distinction subtle, we accept the Board's reasoning that respondent had properly filed and stored the document after preparing it, and thus safeguarded it, but had later violated Rules 1.1(b) and 8.4(d) by failing either to locate the Will in timely fashion or to proceed with probate by causing a copy to be filed and declared the operable Will.

The six-month suspension actually began in September 2005 and ended in July 2006 due to a dispute over whether Respondent properly filed an affidavit pursuant to D.C. Bar R.

Respondent even raises the argument that, since the facts here and in <em>Edwards I </em>grew out of the same time period, we should somehow assume both sets of facts were simultaneously before us and determine an appropriate sanction for the combined violations, citing <em>In re Thompson, </em><a href="/a2d/492/0866-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="492 A.2d 866" data-case-ids="7921978" data-case-paths="/a2d/492/0866-01">492 A.2d 866</a> (D.C.1985); R Brief at 11. First, unlike <em>Thompson, </em>the two matters are not before us simultaneously. Second, we do not — as Respondent does — look upon this overlap in time of her two separate misappropriations — both occurring in the mid 1990s— as somehow mitigating her sanction. <em>See </em>R Brief at 11. Following this logic, since Respondent has already been sanctioned for one misappropriation from that time period, the Board and Court should overlook any other indiscretions at that time. Of course, the current proof involves intentional misappropriation, not negligent misappropriation as in <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>
        <em>Edwards I. </em>Further, if the instant facts had been somehow tried as a separate count in the <em>Edwards I </em>case or these two cases had been consolidated before the Board as in <em>Thompson, </em>thereby presenting the Board and Court with a possible ''pattern” of such improper conduct, it is possible <em>Edwards I </em>would have resulted in a finding of reckless or intentional misappropriation, leading to an earlier disbarment recommendation. <em>See In re Edwards, </em><a href="/a2d/808/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="808 A.2d 476" data-case-ids="11356508" data-case-paths="/a2d/808/0476-01">808 A.2d 476</a>, 485 (D.C.2002), <em>on remand, </em><a href="/a2d/870/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="870 A.2d 90" data-case-ids="9014565" data-case-paths="/a2d/870/0090-01">870 A.2d 90</a> (D.C.2005).</p>
