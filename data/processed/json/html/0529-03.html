On February 9, 1988, acting pursuant to a search and seizure warrant, police officers entered a residence located at 1503 Chew Avenue in Philadelphia and discovered appellant rapidly moving towards the bathroom carrying what turned out to be thirty-four grams of cocaine wrapped inside a newspaper. The police recovered more cocaine during the search of the residence.</p>

After her arrival, Smith watched television in appellant’s bedroom while he got ready for them date. Appellant then entered the bedroom, jumped on top of Smith, ripped off her clothes, and proceeded to rape her at gunpoint. However, during the assault on Smith, she was able to gain control of the gun, hit appellant on the head with the gun, and flee the residence naked from the waist down screaming for help. Neighbors observed Smith and called the police. Upon entering appellant’s residence, police officers discovered several firearms, ammunition, and plastic bags containing several hundred grams of cocaine.</p>

Accordingly, appellant’s aggregate sentence was fifteen to thirty years of imprisonment. Appellant did not file a direct appeal.</p>

Specifically, appellant averred that he had not engaged in an organized crime that infiltrated a legitimate business enterprise, but was merely a seller of controlled substances in an illegal drug dealing enterprise. Appellant requested that his guilty plea to corrupt organizations be declared invalid, and that he be resentenced on the remaining convictions. While his PCRA petition was pending, this Court issued our decision in <em>Besch, </em>which essentially held that the Pa. C.O.A. was intended to criminalize only <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>conduct involving otherwise legitimate business enterprises, and not enterprises (such as the drug conspiracy in <em>Besch) </em>that were wholly illegitimate. <em>Besch, </em><a href="/pa/544/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="674 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="463578,7862507" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0001-01,/a2d/674/0655-01">674 A.2d at 659-660</a>.

On December 26, 1996, the PCRA court denied appellant’s petition, concluding that appellant’s guilty plea was valid. The PCRA court did not address appellant’s <em>Besch </em>argument.</p>

On March 30, 2001, then-Chief United States Magistrate Judge James R. Melin-son filed a report and recommendation recommending that the District Court deny appellant’s petition with prejudice. Chief Magistrate Melinson concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>Besch </em>did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. On October 24, 2001, District Court Judge William H.

On April 23, 2003, the Third Circuit granted appellant a certificate of appealability on two issues: (1) whether the District Court erred by concluding that the concurrent sentence doctrine precludes federal habeas review of appellant’s challenge to his guilty plea; and (2) whether the District Court erred by rejecting on the merits appellant’s claim that his guilty plea for violating the Pa.C.O.A. is invalid under <em>Besch. </em>On January 30, 2004, the Third Circuit filed a Petition for Certification of Question of Law to this Court, asking whether <em>Besch </em>announced a new rule of law, and if so, whether it applies retroactively to a case on collateral review. The Third Circuit noted that because it could not confidently predict how this Court would decide this issue, certification of the question to this Court was necessary.

      <em>Besch’s </em>holding that the statute did not encompass wholly illegitimate enterprises “did not overrule, modify, or limit any previous case from this Court.” <em>Eller, </em><a href="/a2d/807/0838-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="807 A.2d 838" data-case-ids="11354551,312757" data-case-paths="/a2d/807/0838-01,/pa/569/0622-01">807 A.2d at 844</a>. Rather, as the Commonwealth acknowledges, <em>Besch </em>disapproved of the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Yacoubian, </em>which had held that the Pa.C.O.A. encompassed both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. Accordingly, <em>Fiore </em>and <em>Eller </em>command that this Court’s interpretation of the term “enterprise” in <em>Besch </em>was not a “new rule,” but must be deemed to have merely explicated the meaning and scope of the term from the Pa.C.O.A’s original enactment in 1973. The command of <em>Fiore </em>and <em>Eller </em>is also wholly consistent with <em>Shaffer II, </em>where this Court explicitly noted that <em>Besch’s </em>interpretation of the Pa.C.O.A. related back to the date of its enactment. <em>Shaffer II, </em><a href="/a2d/734/0840-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="734 A.2d 840" data-case-ids="11546544,56853" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0840-01,/pa/557/0453-01">734 A.2d at 844</a> (“[0]nce this Court interpreted the legislative language contained in the applicable act, our interpretation became a part of <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>the legislation from the date of its enactment.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a>

In this analysis, the major considerations must be: (1) whether the holding involves an interpretation of a statute or some other source of law; and (2) whether the issue is substantive or procedural. Logically, courts have greater control over questions of retroactivity or prospectivity if the “rule” is of the court’s own making, involves a procedural matter, and involves common law development. On the other hand, courts should have the least flexibility where, as in this ease, the holding at issue both: (a) involves an interpretation of a statute; and (b) far from involving a mere procedural matter, is a statute which defines criminal conduct. A person does not run afoul of Pennsylvania criminal law unless he violates a specific statute; and when this Court holds that a statute does not encompass certain conduct, we do not have a “choice” in determining whether to give retroactive effect to our holding.</p>

Thus, if the General Assembly disagreed with the interpretation, or even if jt agreed but determined that the scope of the statute should be rethought, there was nothing in <em>Besch </em>to prevent that body from revisiting the question and adopting a new standard. <em>See Pap’s A.M. v.

This, of course, is exactly what that body promptly did-and in a fashion that did not seek to retroactively influence prior prosecutions (no doubt out of a recognition of the potential constitutional consequences). In our view, there is a far greater imperative to rethink a precedent when amendatory or corrective measures are exclusively within this Court’s province — as where a rule of judicial procedure is at issue, or where we hold that the Constitution commands a particular result. Although the 1996 amendment was prospective, and thus <em>Besch </em>controlled certain cases and no doubt unsettled the expectations of prosecutorial authorities in those cases, the fact that there could be, and was, a legislative response is “remedy enough.”</p>

This reality, in turn, counsels that the farther we are in time from the decision in <em>Besch, </em>the less wise a course it would be to reconsider it. We are particularly disinclined to reconsider a decision of such narrow effect upon collateral attack— and that disinclination is even stronger where, as here, the request is made by the Commonwealth in a case involving a certified question posed in conjunction with a federal habeas corpus challenge to a conviction arising in time before <em>Besch.</em>

Even assuming that the Commonwealth’s request is appropriate, there were full and timely opportunities to consider the wisdom of <em>Besch </em>— when the dissenting opinion was considered, and again, when <em>Shaffer II </em>was before us. Federal habeas corpus review of state court convictions can be an unsettling enough prospect, offering the defendant an opportunity to overturn a conviction years after the fact (even decades after the fact), and often on grounds that reasonable jurists might debate. It would add another layer of disruption to allow the Commonwealth to attempt to “save” a conviction by securing a rewriting (or a rehabilitation) of the substantive law upon habeas certification. In addition, it is not clear that a federal habeas court would be obliged to accept such a refashioning of substantive law in response to a federal habeas petition. There are reasons rooted in the American devotion to individual freedom why a convicted criminal is permitted multiple bites at the same apple; but, in an instance such as this at least, we would not be in a hurry to allow the Commonwealth such multiple repasts as well.</p>
