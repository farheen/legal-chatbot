Tabatabai worked in the Shah’s government before the Iranian revolution. In 1979 he founded and became president of the Iran Freedom Foundation, a corporation chartered in the state of Maryland. He often criticized Khomeini’s rule in press releases and television appearances here in <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>the United States. With others, Tabatabai had planned an anti-Khomeini demonstration in Washington, D.C. for the week of July 20 to 27, 1980. He was murdered on July 22, 1980 at his residence in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>

Having already committed a number of crimes for the benefit of the Islamic revolution and for his own financial benefit, Hunter became a willing participant in the assassination plan as well. Hunter testified that he went to the Library of Congress in a vain effort to gather information about Tabata-bai, and several times he drove with Bel-field to the Bethesda, Maryland, neighborhood where Tabatabai lived. According to the plan, the assassin was to pose as a postman and needed a getaway car. Hunter made inquiries about procedures for renting a car for a week and told Belfield, who had thousands of dollars in $100 bills, that they would need a credit card to rent a car. Hunter testified that Belfield assured him that he knew someone with a credit card and would take care of it.</p>

On July 20, 1980, Belfield visited a postman acquaintance, Tyrone Frazier, and discussed procedures for delivery of certified and registered packages for receipt of addressee only. Belfield pressured Frazier to agree to lend him his postal jeep so that he could make a delivery. Belfield assured Frazier that he could make the taking of the jeep appear to be forced. He left Frazier two $100 bills, instructions to meet him at the northwest intersection of Idaho Avenue and Woodley Road the next day and instructions on how to receive $300 more when the job was done.</p>

He repaid borrowed money and on occasion successfully asked Abdul-Mani for the use of his car. Abdul-Mani was known for his generosity and willingness to help others in the community.</p>

Although Hunter went to the door with Belfield’s nine millimeter pistol in hand, no one answered the doorbell. They drove away.

Hunter drove. Belfield told him to go to Butler’s apartment. They drove into the parking lot at the rear of 738 Longfellow Street and blew the car horn. Butler first appeared at the window and then came downstairs to admit them through a rear door.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> While inside Butler’s apartment, Belfield put on a postal uniform. He also had with him a light blue pith helmet, two envelopes and the gun. Belfield asked Hunter to go outside and drive the rental car around to the front of the building. Hunter did so. Bel-field, dressed in the postal uniform, came out of the apartment building, got into the car and directed Hunter to drive to the area where Massachusetts Avenue, 39th Street, and Idaho Avenue meet. When Hunter arrived there, he saw Butler drive up in his blue truck and then saw Frazier appear with the postal jeep. They all drove to Woodley Road where Belfield, with his envelopes and gun, got out and directed Frazier out of his jeep and into Butler’s truck. Belfield held one hand on the gun inside one of the envelopes and acted in a manner that would make an uninformed outlooker believe that the postman was being forced into Butler’s truck. Butler drove Frazier toward Baltimore. Belfield drove the postal jeep toward Tabatabai’s house with Hunter close behind in the rental car. After Hunter and Belfield stopped for Bel-field to make a telephone call, Hunter parked in the cul de sac close to the Taba-tabai residence and Belfield continued on to the house.</p>

' He wrote numbers he took from a book on sheets of paper and called for information about flights from La Guardia Airport to Geneva, Switzerland.

Frazier called ¡his postal supervisor from Sligo Junior High School and soon thereafter was met there by postal authorities and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents. He first told them he had been kidnapped by two white men. Once confronted by the fact that his postal jeep had been used in an assassination, he told the truth. Although he had known all along that it was illegal for him to lend his jeep, he had assumed that the worst activity it might have been used for was a drug delivery.

Belfield made inquiries about flights to Paris and Geneva. Hunter prepared to drive back to the District of Columbia. Hunter testified that Belfield gave him three notes and instructions: he was to call Abdul-Mani to tell him to report the ear stolen; he was to call Saud Ramadan in Geneva to say a friend was on the way; he was to call Mehdi (Belfield’s boss) to obtain $2,000.

At about 1:30 p.m. that day, FBI agents arrested appellant Butler in his truck and seized a $100 bill (and three smaller bills), an appointment book listing Abdul-Mani’s phone number, and an address book including Belfield’s number. Hunter heard on his car radio that Butler and the postman had been arrested. Concerned about his own freedom, Hunter called his roommate William Caffee about four times during his drive south to be sure it was safe for him to return. Caffee was a close friend, a codefendant in a pending burglary case, and someone in whom he had confided that he had had an “assignment” on July 22. Hunter arrived home later that night and was warned that police would be looking for the car. Therefore, with a friend Donnell Holmes driving the blue rental car and Hunter and Caffee following in a truck, the car was taken to southwest Washington. After wiping the car to eliminate fingerprints, they abandoned it and drove away in the truck. They stopped at Elmire and South Capitol Streets, where Hunter instructed Caffee to call Abdul-Mani to tell him to report the car stolen. After Caffee made the call, they returned to their apartment. Hunter, tired and nervous after his long drive, asked Caffee to call Mehdi for the $2000. They learned that they had to contact Yahya (also known as John Roberts) for the money. Yahya was another security guard at the Iranian Interests Section, who along with Belfield, worked for Mehdi. Before they got the money, Hunter and Caffee were arrested on unrelated charges on July 24, 1980.</p>

From the trash can in the kitchen, they seized a pair of rubber gloves which bore a print left by Belfield’s right middle finger and particles of gunpowder residue. In the trash they found torn scraps of paper which, when reconstructed, were found to be: directions to Tabatabai’s home; a note about a car, $225, and Ali; and a note directing Butler to look in his toolbox.

One type of admission by a party-opponent is a statement made “by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.” Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). “[Cjoconspirators are considered agents one for another, so that the assertion of one, made in the course and scope of the conspiracy, is the admission of all.” Binder, <em>supra, </em>at 344. The Supreme Court has explained that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b498-14" data-blocks='[["BL_498.14",498,[1022,1425,708,554]]]'>The rationale for both the hearsay conspiracy exception and its limitations is the notion that conspirators are partners in crime.... As such, the law deems them agents of one another. And just as the declarations of an agent bind the principal only when the agent acts within the scope of his authority, so the declaration of a coconspirator must be made in furtherance of the conspiracy charged in order to be admissible against his partner.</blockquote>

The preponderance of the evidence standard requires a weighing of the prosecution’s evidence against that of the defense before admissibility can be determined. While the preponderance standard adequately protects the accused against the risk of admitting unreliable evidence, it also requires, if administered in a conceptually consistent manner, delay of the admissibility decision until the close of all the evidence. <em>Coconspirator Exception, supra, </em>at 143. This circumstance forces the court into one of two options: conditional admission of the hearsay evidence at trial with the incumbent risk of prejudice to the defendant, or the practical inconvenience of a preliminary mini-trial to enable the judge to determine admissibility prior to trial. It must be recognized that where the hearsay is conditionally admitted, there is built into the decision-making process a pressure to find the hearsay admissible in order to avoid the necessity of a mistrial.</p>

Although we express our standard differently, the quantum of proof the prosecution must satisfy remains identical to that required by the preponderance of the evidence standard.

Therefore, the trial judge should make the admissibility determination during the prosecution’s evidence.

The one-step admissibility determination this approach facilitates also avoids the impractieality of the mini-trial necessary to unconditional admission under the preponderance standard.

Prior to the homicide, Belfield changed into the postal uniform in Butler’s apartment while Butler was present. Butler participated in Belfield’s scheme by driving postman Frazier to and around Baltimore while the assassination took place. Belfield returned to Butler’s apartment after the murder. According to Hunter’s testimony, Belfield put his gun in a box in one of the rooms in Butler’s apartment, and left a note and a $100 bill tacked on the wall. Butler was arrested the day after the murder and was found to have a $100 bill in his possession. Three days later, Butler’s sister forcibly entered Butler’s apartment to get some of his things. The following day the FBI searched the apartment. Among other things, they found a mailbag, a pith helmet, a toolbox, and a pair of rubber gloves bearing Belfield’s fingerprint and particles of gunpowder residue.

Initially, I do not read the prior decisions to hold that the government must prove that the accessory’s assistance did, in fact, help the principal make good his escape. It is enough that the accused knowingly took overt steps with a view — successful or not — toward rendering aid. <em>See United States v. Honesty, </em><a href="" class="citation" data-index="218" data-cite="148 U.S. App. D.C. 255">148 U.S.App.D.C. 255</a>, <a href="/f2d/459/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="219" data-cite="459 F.2d 1279" data-case-ids="5700795,724272" data-case-paths="/f2d/459/1279-01">459 F.2d 1279</a> (1971) (where a murder suspect was tracked by police officers to an apartment shared with his wife, she unsuccessfully blocked a bathroom door to help him elude police; the court concluded that her overt acts served as an adequate basis for conviction). Thus, I submit that it is the character or nature of the accessory’s act (along with the requisite intent) which is paramount, not the success or failure which the principal encounters in seeking to escape.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

My review of the record does not lead me to conclude that, when Abdul-Mani reported the car stolen on July 31,1980, Belfield had already “effected” his escape. I do not think that the government concedes this point on appeal. Belfield was last seen in Montreal on July 23. The fairest reading of the record holds that there is no evidence showing Belfield’s whereabouts after that date.</p>
