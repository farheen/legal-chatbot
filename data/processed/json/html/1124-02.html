The court reasoned that these crimes would not constitute dangerous crimes and thus would be beyond the scope of wiretap investigation permitted by the Federal Act. The court concluded that the interceptions were properly authorized, however, because the investigation extended to the crime of corrupt organizations for the promotion of prostitution. Taking judicial notice of the existence of “a health crisis brought on by a sexually transmitted virus which causes the fatal disease known as AIDS,” the court determined that in such circumstances the promoting of anonymous sexual intercourse for profit represented a danger to life. The court emphasized the vast scale of the enterprise under investigation in distinguishing fornication, adultery, and individual acts of prostitution, which might involve the same type of health risk but would not be subject to investigation by wiretapping.</p>

This Act amended Pennsylvania’s first Corrupt Organizations statute, the Act of December 8,1970 (P.L. 874, No. 276, §§ 1 to 9).

In the interim, on December 6, 1972, Section 72 of the Statutory Construction Act had been repealed and replaced by 1 Pa.C.S. § 1952. However, Section 4 of the Crimes Code legislation was not revised to reflect this change and continued to refer to Section 72, which had been repealed.</p>

The analysis assumes that, as with any of the other elements of the application for authorization, the assertion of an investigation of corrupt organizations violations is bona fide and not merely a ruse to investigate by wiretaps a crime not included in the Act. The Superior Court judge to whom the application is presented must make this assessment in deciding whether to authorize the interceptions or not. In the present case, there is no question that the application described a legitimate investigation of the Appellants for violations of the corrupt organizations statute, as they were ultimately convicted thereunder.</p>

Our analysis leads to the same conclusion with respect to the decision in <em>United States v. Millstone Enterprises, Inc., </em><a href="/f-supp/684/0867-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="684 F.

That case was a proceeding for enforcement of an Internal Revenue Service summons served on six corporations. The summons was issued in connection with an investigation of William Robert Birdseye, <a id="p1129" href="#p1129" data-label="1129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1129</a>the appellant at No. 57 W.D. Appeal Docket, 1994, who was the president of the six corporations. Birdseye and the corporations refused to respond to the summons, asserting that the investigation derived from illegal wiretaps, the same wiretaps involved in the appeals now before this Court. The District Court agreed that “the state crimes for which the wiretaps were approved to investigate are not offenses within the scope of section 2516(2) ... and any evidence derived therefrom should not be used in a proceeding before a government body.” <a href="/f-supp/684/0867-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="684 F.

Noting that the Pennsylvania Act included prostitution as an offense that could be investigated by wiretaps only where it is "dangerous to life, limb or property," the court concluded that "an alleged corrupt organizations violation, where a non-violent prostitution related offense is the underlying ‘racketeering activity,’ may [not] be permitted to bootstrap prostitution-related conduct into the category of crimes dangerous to life or limb.” <em><a href="/f-supp/684/0867-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="684 F.
