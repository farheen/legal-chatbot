    <p id="b463-12" data-blocks='[["BL_463.11",463,[179,1383,754,871]]]'>The respondent, Kenneth L. Hall, is a member of the Bar of this court, as well as those of Colorado and Nevada. He was suspended from the practice of law for forty-days by the Supreme Court of Nevada on July 15, 2004,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> after having pleaded guilty to gross misdemeanor child abuse and neglect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Respondent reported this discipline to Bar Counsel as required by D.C. Bar R. XI, § 11(b), and Bar Counsel in turn notified this court. We then suspended respondent on an interim basis and directed the Board on Professional Responsibility (“Board”) to recommend whether identical, greater, or lesser discipline should be imposed as reciprocal discipline or whether it would proceed <em>de novo.</em>

    <p id="b463-15" data-blocks='[["BL_463.14",463,[977,280,756,1022]]]'>On December 8, 2006, the Board submitted a report recommending imposition of the identical reciprocal discipline of a forty-day suspension.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Respondent did not file affidavits that were in compliance with <em>In re Goldberg, </em><a href="/a2d/460/0982-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="460 A.2d 982" data-case-ids="8014294" data-case-paths="/a2d/460/0982-01">460 A.2d 982</a>, 985 (D.C. 1988) and D.C. Bar R. XI, § 14(g); however, since his attempts to do so had been made in good-faith and were very nearly compliant, the Board further recommended that he be allowed to cure the deficiency by filing a supplemental affidavit within fourteen days from the date of its report. On December 13, 2006, Bar Counsel informed us that he took no exception to the Board’s report and recommendation. Respondent has not filed an opposition to the report, but he did submit a timely supplemental affidavit in compliance with Board’s recommendation.</p>
