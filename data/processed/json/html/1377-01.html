He claimed that his attack was precipitated by the interaction of employment-induced stress with his pre-existing cardiac condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a congenital condition. A hearing examiner for the Department of Employment Services (“the agency”) denied his claim for temporary total disability under the District of Columbia Workers’ Compensation Act of 1979, D.C.Code §§ 36-301 <em>et. seq. </em>(1993 Repl.) (“the Act”), on the ground that he did not sustain an injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment. We affirm.</p>

    <p id="b1428-17" data-blocks='[["BL_1428.16",1428,[985,742,751,1041]]]'>In Fall 1984, Mr. McKinley discovered that he had a congenital heart condition, diagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy/ven-tricular tachycardia. In Spring 1985, and again in June 1986, he underwent cardiac medication tests to determine the most effective medication for his condition. The 1986 tests took place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) was induced. During the tests, he went into cardiac arrest and, as Mr. McKinley explained, the doctors “used the electro padels to bring me back.” He described this incident as “a very difficult experience, very traumatic.” In May 1990, Mr. McKinley experienced heart palpitations, and was monitored by way of a holter. The results of the holter monitor showed “[njo couplets or tachycardia beats” but Mr. McKinley reported “some sensations of rapid heart beating.” Eventually, the drug Norpace was prescribed (400 mg. per dose).</p>
    <p id="b1428-18" data-blocks='[["BL_1428.17",1428,[982,1813,748,802]]]'>On January 6, 1991, Mr. McKinley was ordered by his supervisor, Mr. Robert Cur-rence, to operate a television camera moments before a broadcast was scheduled to begin. Mr. Currence yelled at Mr. McKinley, telling him that the schedule had been changed, and questioned why he did not review his schedule. After the broadcast, Mr. Currence continued to reprimand Mr. McKinley who became fearful of a physical assault. The following day Mr. McKinley arrived late to work and Mr. Currence had already left for the evening. Therefore, there was no contact between the two men. However, co-workers advised Mr. McKinley that Mr. Currence was angered and irritated by his tardiness.</p>

He did not speak with Mr. Cur-rence, but someone advised him that Mr. Currence’s criticism continued. On January 9,1991, Mr. McKinley filed a union grievance against Mr. Currence, and informed his employer that he did not intend to return to work until the matter was resolved. This was his first complaint against Mr. Currence. On January 10, 1991, Mr. McKinley received a call from Mr. Michael Maher, a member of the station’s management, notifying him that the complaint was under investigation and that he was expected to return to work. Mr. McKinley did not speak with Mr. Currence before or after Mr. Maher’s call. Some time after the phone call Mr. McKinley ate dinner, and attended church with his family.</p>
    <p id="b1429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1429.4",1429,[187,1044,751,546]]]'>Later that evening while en route to work via Interstate 270 in Maryland, Mi*. McKinley experienced lightheadedness, palpitations and dizziness. He pulled over to the side of the road until the symptoms abated. As he resumed his trip, his lightheadedness and palpitations recurred. He stopped at a gas station. An ambulance was called, and he was transported to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he was evaluated and treated. At the time of his attack, Mr. McKinley said he believed that his death was imminent.</p>

He found a regular heart beat and heard a “systolic murmur ... at right external border.” His assessment in part was “[p]alpitations, need to rule out recurrent ventricular tachycardia.” He noted that “[Mr. McKinley] is uncertain whether [his reported palpitations were] actually true arrhythmias as he has had in the past, versus stress related palpitations.” When Mr. McKinley saw his treating physician, Dr. Jeffrey Cowen after the highway incident, Dr. Cowen noted no arrhythmias. Nonetheless, Dr. Cowen equipped Mr. McKinley with a holter monitor on January 17 and 18, 1991. According to Dr. Cowen, the results of the holter test were “extremely benign. He had occasional PVCs, nothing worse.” Dr. Cow-en referred Mr. McKinley to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Mendell. Mr. McKinley also was examined by doctors at NIH on January 30 and 31, 1991. Notations on those days by NIH doctors indicate that Mr. McKinley was “concerned [about] recent episode of palpitations and near syncope” and that “while driving” he reported “episodes of palpitations with dizziness.” There is no reference to his place of employment or Mr. Currence. On February 25, 1991, Dr. Anne B. Cetnarow-ski-Cropp of NIH’s Cardiology Branch, wrote, “Robert B. McKinley is a patient of the National Institutes of Health. After his physical examination on January 30th, I recommended to Mr. McKinley that he should be admitted to the Clinical Center for evaluation of an investigational medication for his medical condition.” Mr. McKinley was scheduled to be readmitted to NIH on March 17, 1991, for a two week period to participate in tests involving the medication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Beginning around February 15, 1991, he went on a scheduled paternity leave for three months in connection with the birth of his new child, and did not return to work until May 16, 1991. On May 13, 1991, Dr. Lameh Fananapazir, head of the Eleetrophysiology Laboratory, Cardiology Branch, at NIH responded to a letter from Mr. McKinley which apparently inquired about his return to work. She wrote, “[i]n response to your letter of May 10, addressed to Dr. Cropp, this is to confirm that we believe you should be able to return to your employment, provided that you avoid heavy physical exertion or extraordinary emotional stress.”</p>

Mr. Currence did not work on that day, and had previously given up his position as a supervisor. After his meeting with station officials, another employee, Mr. John Hanson, reportedly told Mr. McKinley that Mr. Currence said “he couldn’t wait to see me so he could put the fear of God into me and hoped I would die.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The record does <a id="p1380" href="#p1380" data-label="1380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1380</a>not reveal any medical treatment on May 16.

In his answers to interrogatories, he claimed as his injuries, “a run of ventricular tachycardia, a cardiac dysfunction” and “post traumatic stress, an emotional injury.” A full eviden-tiary hearing was held by the agency on November 19, and December 2, 1991. The hearing examiner articulated the following issues:</p>

He provided an account of his experiences with Mr. Cur-rence, the episode of January 10, 1991, the history of his heart condition, his psychotherapy treatment, and other matters. The company presented testimony by Mr. James Gilmore, Jr., a supervisor and Mr. John Tol-lefson, Vice President for Operations &amp; Engineering at WJLA-TV. Mr. Gilmore gave his impressions of Mr. McKinley, and described the interaction between Mr. Cur-rence and Mr. McKinley. He indicated that Mr. Currenee had a “harsh” management style and often was called “Little Hitler.” Mr. Gilmore said he “may have once” witnessed a personal confrontation between Mr. Currenee and Mr. McKinley when Mr. McKinley reported to work late. According to him, in that confrontation Mr. Currenee “just rode [Mr. McKinley] for about the best part of an hour or so.” When asked whether Mr. McKinley was “a sensitive individual,” Mr. Gilmore responded, “I think that was basically because of his condition. If something was going wrong, most of us would be able to handle that amount of stress; whereby with him, he wouldn’t exactly go to pieces, but it would bother him as the day wore on.”</p>

[but] did, however, ... find that some of Mr. Cur-rence’s actions were not proper, and he was issued a letter of reprimand.” On cross-examination, Mr. Tollefson explained, “I had found that some of Mr. Currence’s actions not related to Mr. McKinley were inappropriate which led to his letter of reprimand. ...” After he received the letter of reprimand, Mr. Currenee asked to be relieved of his supervisory duties. In August 1991, Mr. Tollefson heard allegations about some threats Mr. Currenee had made, not to Mr. McKinley, but about Mr. McKinley. He investigated and found that Mr. Currenee “had acted inappropriately.” Mr. Currenee was suspended without pay, pending a discharge.</p>

When asked whether he had “encountered situations where patients or people suffered V-tach without any unusual stress,” Dr. Cow-en said “yes.” In response to the question, “[i]s it possible it could have happened in Mr. McKinley’s case,” Dr. Cowen stated, “[i]t’s possible.” Dr. Cowen also asserted, “[t]he cause for this gentleman to have ventricular tachycardia is his underlying heart disease that makes him susceptible. Precipitating factors are varied and multiple, and with many contributing causes occurring at one point, and the rhythm disturbance is initiated. Of those causes stress appears to be one of them.” He identified other causes as “[t]he electrical milieu of your automatic nervous system[,][p]harmacological agents ... in the body at the time[,][a]lcohol, disturbances in electrolytes, oxygenation in an individual with disease who has asthma, or pneumonia whose oxygen levels become low_” In response to the question, “[b]ut we have no objective way of knowing which of those several items you just mentioned may have been a particular trigger in this case,” Dr. Cowen said, “[tjhere’s no objective way to tell.” He also acknowledged that if Mr. McKinley did not have a heart problem, it was “very unlikely” that stress would have caused the V-tach. Dr. Cowen indicated that Mr. McKinley was taking the drug Norpace on January 10, 1991, and that “nobody measured” whether he had alcohol in his system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

He also asserted, “[t]he cause for this gentleman to have ventricular tachycardia is his underlying heart disease that makes him susceptible,” and acknowledged, it was “very unlikely” that stress would have caused V-tach if Mr. McKinley did not have a heart problem. Moreover, the record reveals that when he was treated at Frederick Memorial Hospital on January 10, 1991, Mr. McKinley told the doctors that he was “uncertain whether [his reported palpitations were] actually true arrhythmias as he had in the past, versus stress related palpitations.” And, even Dr. Mendell, Mr. McKinley’s psychiatrist, mentioned his “ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation, and cardiac arrest” twice at NIH in 1986 as associated with his fear of dying due to a V-tach. When Dr. Mendell performed a “mental status examination” on Mr. McKinley on February 14, 1991, it revealed “thought content ... focused largely on his fears about his cardiac problems,” a belief that “I could have died” [on January 10, 1991], and a “defective feeling, guilty because [his] son also had the early signs of the same illness.” Dr. Mendell candidly admitted that he had “no direct knowledge” or “independent information about what happened at [Mr. McKinley’s] work [site].” In contrast, Mr. Tollefson investigated Mr. McKinley’s accusations of harassment against Mr. Currence and was unable to substantiate them.

Dr. Brain connected Mr. McKinley’s anxiety disorder to the “two episodes of cardiac arrest [at NIH in 1986] which required electrical defibrillation.” Dr. Brain specifically disagreed with Dr. Mendell’s diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder, saying, “[t]he diagnostic picture that emerges is of a man with significant anxiety disorder with features of a panic disorder. However, ... I do not concur with the conclusions of Dr. Mendell that this represents Post Traumatic Stress Disor-der_ [W]hile Mr. McKinley did suffer some harassment at the hands of his supervisor this was a pattern of behavior which he was exposed to over an extended period of time and for which he has shown no prior significant adverse response_ [Mr. <a id="p1386" href="#p1386" data-label="1386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1386</a>McKinley’s Anxiety Disorder with panic] is not causally related to conditions of employment.” Dr. Mendell, Mr. McKinley’s psychiatrist also noted that Mr. McKinley’s “thought content was focused largely on his fears about his cardiac problems.” Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the hearing examiner’s conclusion that Mr. McKinley’s psychological disorder was not caused by his work environment.</p>

McKinley argued, first, that he experienced considerable stress resulting from confrontations with his supervisor, Robert Currenee, and from the fact that McKinley was required to return to work with Currenee pending resolution of McKinley’s formal complaint against him. Next, according to McKinley, that stress (coupled with anxiety over the impending birth of a child) aggravated his preexisting, asymptomatic heart condition — hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — and thereby caused the attack of ventricular tachycardia that he experienced while driving to work on January 10, 1991. Finally, said McKinley, this traumatic, near-death experience on January 10 — a heart-related attack caused primarily by work stress — in turn caused a psychological condition, post-traumatic stress disorder, resulting in temporary total disability. In short, he says, work stress caused a heart-<a id="p1387" href="#p1387" data-label="1387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1387</a>related attack which in turn caused a temporarily totally disabling psychological condition that entitled him to worker’s compensation benefits.</p>

But, according to the examiner, the employer rebutted this presumption by demonstrating that the heart-related attack occurred off the employer’s premises. The examiner, therefore, ultimately rejected McKinley’s argument, concluding that: “[McKinley’s] ventricular tachycardia did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.

Larson’s treatise argues persuasively that, particularly in “heart cases” — of which this case is one — there are two distinct causation issues: (1) whether the exertion actually caused, from a medical point of view, the claimant’s injury; and (2) whether the particular exertion is deemed sufficient by the courts to establish legal causation. <em>See </em>2 Larson &amp; Larson, <em>supra, </em>§ 38.83(a), at 7-312 to -319.

The employer offered no expert medical testimony to the effect that stress does not contribute to attacks of ventricular tachycardia; nor did any expert for the employer testify that McKinley had not been under a sufficient amount of work-related stress to trigger such a cardiac episode.

Absent medical testimony in support of the examiner’s analysis, the separation in time does nothing but establish a mere possibility that McKinley’s anxiety had waned during the three days between his quarrel with Currence and his attack. McKinley’s cardiac episode, moreover, was not isolated from the workplace; it occurred on his way to work after his employer had told him he must continue to work with Currence. Furthermore, McKinley testified that he was thinking about the impending confrontation with Currence when he suffered the attack. This brief (three-day) lapse of time, therefore, even when coupled with the fact that McKinley had filed a grievance rather than taking less civilized action, and had eaten dinner with his family and gone to church before returning to work, does not — without supporting expert testimony — negate medical causation.

That, I suggest, is not enough to rebut the presumption of com-pensability, based on medical causation which the hearing examiner herself did not find refuted.</p>

There was no dispute that McKinley's proof satisfied the third step of his analysis: the ventricular tachycardia caused McKinley's psychological disorder. McKinley’s psychiatric expert.

McKinley alleges that work-related stress caused his attack of ventricular tachycardia, which in turn caused his anxiety disorder. These distinct causal steps should not be lumped together to conclude that McKinley seeks compensation for emotional injury caused, simply, by job-related stress. The first question, therefore, is whether McKinley’s cardiac episode was work-related. <em>Spartin </em>has nothing to say about the work-connectedness of a cardiac injury, and thus we should apply Larson's legal causation formula for cardiac episodes partially caused by a diseased or weakened heart: was McKinley's job stress an "exertion greater than that of unemployment life”? If the answer is yes, the second question is whether McKinley's psychological condition satisfies the work-relatedness test because it resulted directly from a compensable injury, namely McKinley's near-death experience on Interstate 270. <em>Spartin </em>offers nothing here.

In sum, because McKinley's complaint alleges that his psychological condition was caused by a traumatic, stress-related, heart-related attack — not simply by work stress <em>itself </em>— -Spartin is altogether inapplicable.</p>
