There, we determined: (1) a tax exemption for the independent living apartments did not arise simply because they were located on the same property as the assisted living compound and the nursing home; "otherwise, any use could be placed on property that already has received a tax exemption for real estate based on a charitable exemption[,]” <em>id. </em>at 434; and (2) substantial evidence supported common pleas’ determination that Chapel Pointe failed to prove it donated or gratuitously rendered a substantial portion of its services to the independent living residents.</p>

        <em>Alliance Home </em>is distinguishable. First, the matter sub judice does not concern whether a different type of use on property previously determined to be tax exempt is also tax exempt by virtue of its location on the same property. Second, while, in <em>Alliance Home, </em>we alternately considered whether the independent living apartments separately satisfied Section 5(d)(l)(iii) of the Charity Act (specifying that an institution donates or gratuitously renders a substantial portion of its services where the institution provides "[wjholly gratuitous goods or services to at least 5% of those receiving similar goods or services from the institution”), we did so because Chapel Pointe, the entity seeking the exemption, specifically raised the issue. In affirming common pleas’ denial of the tax exemption request, we emphasized its reasoning under Article VIII, § 2(a)(v) of the Pennsylvania Constitution that “it is 'only that portion of real property of [an] institution which is actually and regularly used’ for ‘purely public charity’ that is exempt from real property taxes.” <a href="/a2d/852/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="852 A.2d 428" data-case-ids="9232490" data-case-paths="/a2d/852/0428-01">852 A.2d at 435</a>.
