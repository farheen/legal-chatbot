After turning east onto S Street from North Capitol Street, Alioto noticed Dyson suspiciously ducking his head behind a car. Officer Alioto told Officer Dixon first to stop the police car and then to shift it into reverse. When Dyson began walking westbound on S Street, Officer Alioto got out of the car and told him to stop. Dyson, however, dropped a crumpled-up paper bag in the tree box area between the curb and the sidewalk, and then started to run. After taking note of where the bag landed, Alio-to began to chase Dyson.</p>

They found the bag in the same spot where it had fallen, and inside it they discovered six blue zi-plock bags of what was later determined to be marijuana. Officers Dixon and Alioto then returned to the alley where Dyson had been arrested. Officer Alioto approached Dyson, who was seated in the transport vehicle, and asked him where the gun was. Alioto said, “If there’s a gun, we need to find it, so no little kids get it and hurt themselves.” Dyson responded, “That was my weed, but I don’t have a gun.” At that point Dyson had not been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>

After Alioto testified, the court ruled that, although Dyson was in custody at the time he was asked about the gun, his response was admissible under the “very narrow” public safety exception described in <em>New York v. Quarles. </em>The court found that Officer Al-ioto had a good faith belief that Dyson had a gun and that he had a reasonable basis for that belief. The court noted its concern about “whether the officer’s belief that there’s a gun has to be based on stronger objective evidence, either direct or circumstantial,” but nevertheless concluded:</p>

Given the opportunity to cross-examine the officer at trial, however, defense counsel was not able to elicit any evidence that Officer Aioto’s perceptions were faulty, aside from the fact that no gun was found. Additionally, under the circumstances of the case — that Dyson was fleeing from a police officer late at night in order to avoid being caught with drugs — it was not unreasonable for Officer Aioto to interpret Dyson’s waistband-tugging as a sign that he might be armed.

In support of this argument, Dyson analogizes his arrest to the one that occurred in <em>United States v. Mobley. </em>In that case the police, armed with arrest and search warrants, conducted a drug raid on Mobley’s home. Mobley answered the door naked and unarmed and was promptly placed under arrest. Police officers conducted a security sweep of the apartment and determined that Mobley was the only person present. An officer then asked Mobley whether there was anything in the apartment that would be a danger to agents conducting a more thorough search, and Mobley responded by telling them about a gun in one of the bedrooms. The court ruled that the police questioning did not fall within the public safety exception because there was nothing that distinguished the case from one involving an ordinary arrest. <a href="/f3d/40/0688-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="40 F.3d 688" data-case-ids="10525706" data-case-paths="/f3d/40/0688-01">40 F.3d at 693</a>.</p>

An arrest made after chasing an unknown person through public streets into an alley late at night is vastly different from an arrest pursuant to a warrant during a daytime drug raid on a suspect’s apartment. Moreover, although the alley in this case was cordoned off from the public after the arrest, a gun hidden in the alley by Dyson could readily <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>have wound up in the hands of someone else, such as a neighborhood child playing in the alley, if it had escaped detection by the police.

Appellant was arrested in the early morning hours in a deserted alley. <em>Cf. Allen, supra </em>note 2, 305 F.3d at 1051 (noting that discovery of gun in a deserted area is irrelevant if at the time officers asked the question they thought it was “reasonably possible that anyone could have found the gun and used it” anywhere between a campsite and the arrest scene, including a gas station or store where the suspect had been seen). An immediate patdown of his person yielded no gun and the two officers who had chased and apprehended him briefly searched the, alley — again finding no gun. They then left to retrieve a <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>brown bag (later found to contain marijuana) they had seen appellant drop into a tree box during the chase. Meanwhile, other officers had cordoned off the alley and searched it with a K-9 unit, also finding no weapon. It was only after the two arresting officers returned with the bag of marijuana that they asked appellant, who by then had been handcuffed and placed in a patrol car, about the gun. Unlike in <em>Quarles </em>and our prior cases applying the public safety exception, the question about the gun in this case was not the first thing out of the officer’s mouth, fast on the heels of apprehending the suspect. That delay, informed by the negative result of immediate searches of appellant’s person and (at least three) of the alley, eroded whatever reasonable belief the officer might have had based on what he thought he saw during the chase. Further, the police’s prompt action in cordoning off the alley where the officer thought the gun might be and the absence of people in that area during the wee hours of the morning, diminished the urgency of any objectively reasonable risk to public safety — no matter how genuine the officer’s subjective concern. Finally, unlike in <em>Quarles </em>where the Court relied on the officer’s prompt advisal of <em>Miranda </em>rights upon satisfying the public safety concern, the evidence in this case is that appellant was not advised at the scene, by any officer, of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>

The officer testified that after appellant had been arrested, handcuffed, and put into a police cruiser, he "asked the defendant where the gun was. If there’s a gun, we need to find it, so no little kids get it and hurt themselves.” According to the officer, appellant said: “That was my weed, but I didn't have a gun.”</p>

In <em>Quarles, </em>the Court balanced the interest in public safety against <em>Miranda's </em>prophylactic rule, noting that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not constitutionally mandated. <em>See </em><a href="/us/467/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="467 U.S. 649" data-case-ids="6205709" data-case-paths="/us/467/0649-01">467 U.S. at 654</a>, <a href="/us/467/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="467 U.S. 649" data-case-ids="6205709" data-case-paths="/us/467/0649-01">104 S.Ct. 2626</a>.
