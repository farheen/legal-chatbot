The actual voting requirements were left to the Board’s discretion, and the three-vote requirement was merely a procedural change which was held not to be an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. <em>Id. </em>The reasoning and holding in <em>Myers </em>remains valid, and is dispositive of appellant’s argument; he is not entitled to mandamus relief on this basis.</p>
