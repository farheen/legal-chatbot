Mr. Maxey was injured in a compensable industrial accident on September 3, 1969. In addition to total disability, he incurred permanent injury to his left arm. He could no longer function as a non-licensed plumber, a position which, at the time of the accident, paid him $180 per week, $4.50 per hour. He subsequently obtained employment at a <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>gas station in July of 1970, and received a salary of $500 per month for a 50-hour week, approximately $2.50 per hour. He was awarded compensation for permanent partial disability in the amount of $50 per week by the Board pursuant to 19 Del.C. § 2325.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[152,613,755,572]]]'>In April of 1973, Mr. Maxey was made supervisor of the Kayo Gas Station in Els-mere. His wages were $700 per month for a 50 hour week, the equivalent of $3.22 per hour, and he was subject to 24-hour call. On October 10, 1973 Maxey was transferred to another Kayo Station in Twin Oaks, Pennsylvania, where he served as manager. There he earned wages of $625 per month for a 50-hour seek, approximately $3.10 per hour, but he was no longer subject to 24-hour call.</p>
    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[150,1233,754,379]]]'>The employer, appellee herein, on July 5, 1973, petitioned the Board to reduce Max-ey’s weekly compensation. Mr. Maxey urged the Board to deny this request on the ground that inflation accounted, in part, for his increased wages and, considering the inflationary factor, his compensation should remain $50 per week.</p>
    <p id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.6",195,[148,1662,754,473]],["BL_195.7",195,[962,240,751,86]]]'>At the hearing before the Board, held on November 13, 1973, David Golland, Research Analyst Chief of the Delaware Department of Labor, testifying on behalf of Mr. Maxey, stated that one of his duties was to compute the average weekly wage of covered employees <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in the State of Delaware and that such average weekly wage has increased from $143 a week in 1969 to approximately $170 a week in 1973. This demonstrates an inflationary trend of approximately 19%.</p>
    <p id="b195-11" data-blocks='[["BL_195.11",195,[957,363,755,709]]]'>The Board refused to take into account the change in wage scales since 1969. It estimated the hourly differential between Maxey’s pre-injury and post-injury wages and, based on a 40-hour week, computed a weekly loss of $51.20 for the period between April, 1973 and October 10, 1973 and a weekly loss of $64.80 for the com-pensable period subsequent to October 10, 1973. It therefore determined that Maxey was entitled to compensation in the amount of $34.13 per week for the period between April, 1973 and October 10, 1973 and $43.-80 per week for the compensable period thereafter.</p>
    <p id="b195-12" data-blocks='[["BL_195.12",195,[955,1116,755,473]]]'>Maxey contends that the Board erred as a matter of law in failing to consider the increase in wage levels since 1969. He argues that in order to properly calculate his compensation either his pre-injury wages must be adjusted upward or his post-injury wages adjusted downward to reflect the wage level change since 1969. Maxey relies on the testimony of Mr. Gol-land to demonstrate said change.</p>

Moreover, Larson, in concluding that post-injury earning capacity must be measured by wage levels in effect at the time of the injury, relies heavily on the case of Whyte v.
