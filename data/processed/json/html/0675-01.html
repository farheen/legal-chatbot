    <p id="b714-3" data-blocks='[["BL_714.4",714,[232,411,750,471]]]'>This Court is asked to review a decision of the Industrial Accident Board dated June 9, 1971, which increased claimant’s neck disability from 12i/¿% to 30% and denied any compensation for her claim of permanent loss of use of her right arm. Mrs. Ware argues that she was entitled to more than 30% and that the Board erred in denying her compensation for loss of use of her right arm.</p>

Claimant argues that the Board should have accepted either the testimony of Dr. Cucazzella or Dr. Vates but should not have decided on a figure in between. The Board, just like a jury, was not bound to accept the percentage figure of either doctor. It has the right to decide on a percentage disability in-between the two figures mentioned by the doctors. There was no arbitrary action by the Board. What it did was proper on the evidence before it.</p>

On the other hand, Dr. Vates, in various parts of the record, reached the conclusion that the right arm injury was unrelated to the 1963 accident. For instance, Dr. Vates testified as follows :</p>
    <blockquote id="b714-9" data-blocks='[["BL_714.10",714,[1073,191,712,424]]]'>“The right-arm problem I thought was difficult to attribute to her fall unless one could find continuity between the fall and when the pain began. And in going over the records, there appeared to be at least a two-year discrepancy of the time of the fall to the time the pain began, if one goes by the records I could get. Possibly longer.” (Bd. Tr. 41).</blockquote>
    <p id="b714-10" data-blocks='[["BL_714.11",714,[1035,652,750,318]]]'>Later, Dr. Vates opined that Mrs. Ware had “radiculitis of several nerve roots” in her right arm; he said he would think that the radiculitis would not be related to the 1963 injury (Bd. Tr. 41, 42); and on cross-examination by claimant’s attorney, Dr. Vates remarked:</p>
    <blockquote id="b714-11" data-blocks='[["BL_714.12",714,[1073,1014,711,133]]]'>“In other words, I am still up the same tree to attribute the symptoms of the right arm to the fall.” (Bd. Tr. 52).</blockquote>

It could discount or reject Mrs. Ware’s testimony that “she noticed the problem with her right arm” after she got out of the hospital in 1963.

Dr. Bailey tes<a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>tified that he didn’t know whether the right arm problem related to the accident or not and commented:</p>
