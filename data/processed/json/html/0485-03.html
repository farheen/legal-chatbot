When he arrived, Officer Rivera encountered Faith Wallace, one of the defendant’s teenage children, standing outside the home with a younger child, claiming that her mother, Margaret, would not stop spanking the child. Because it was windy and cold outside, Officer Rivera asked Faith if they could talk inside, and they entered the residence. Officer Rivera testified that he “was in for a surprise” when he entered the home, and said that he observed a very dirty home with young children everywhere, open containers of food, fleas, and flies. There was a foul odor in the air and the deteriorated roof, which was covered with a tarp had resulted in leaks that had caused most of the kitchen floor to rot away. Officer Rivera said that Mr. Wallace told him the roof had been leaking for five years. Because of the conditions he observed, Officer Rivera called Children and Youth Services<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and a Housing Code Inspector to respond to the scene, and then continued to go through the house.</blockquote>

There were food and dirt stains on the walls and fleas and flies in the air. Officer Rivera indicated that “[t]here was food on the walls. Food on the ceilings. The kitchen was totally destroyed. The ceilings were gone. The floor was gone.” Boxes were piled in all the rooms, and “[t]he stove had things stacked on top of it. The food inside [the refrigerator] was in a spoiled condition. The freezer was open. There was no door on it.”</blockquote>

After working through a code checklist on that day and returning <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>a few days later to follow up, Mr. Holler condemned the home, finding it uninhabitable. Mr. Holler testified that he based this decision on the residence’s lack of a heating system, the poor structural condition of the home, and the unsanitary conditions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[244,651,720,1311]]]'>Mr. Holler testified that the City of Allentown requires that the heating facility in a home “shall be capable of heating all habitable rooms and bathrooms to a temperature of 68 degrees.” The furnace in the home was not working, and although the defendant had four or five portable heaters, the [C]ity of Allentown does not recognize space heaters as a means of heating a home. The defendant testified that the home was also equipped with electric baseboard heating, but Mr. Holler indicated that “because of the condition of the house, the way they had things stored in the house and boxes through the home ... the baseboard heating would have been ineffectual in any case, most likely a fire hazard in my opinion.” Mr. Holler also stated that the home did not have any smoke detectors, which the [C]ity of Allentown requires in the cellar and on each floor. There were also several plumbing fixtures in the home that did not work, including the kitchen faucet and a bathroom faucet.</blockquote>

He testified that the walls needed to be redone since they were cracked and covered with food. Pieces of the walls were also missing due to the water damage from the leaking roof. One quarter of the roof was missing “[a]nd everything had leaked down through the roof in the ceiling in the kitchen.” There was also a water leak running into an electrical box in the basement, which Mr. Holler testified was a potential danger. The ceiling in the kitchen was almost totally gone, and there was also water damage in the living room and on the second floor in the children’s bedroom. The floor was missing in the kitchen and “went down to the rafters of the ceiling in the basement.” Mr. Holler testified that “[y]ou’re essentially walking on [ ] the bottom half of a piece of plywood.”</blockquote>

He testified that there was food on the walls and ceilings, and tea bags were hanging from the ceilings. “[T]he home had an odor of stale and rotting food and a smell of being unclean. Bacteria in the air. That type of thing.” Mr. Holler also indicated that there were flies, fleas and hundreds of mice in the home. The mice were “[a]ll through the house. Mainly in the living room and basement. There were nests all over the place.”</blockquote>

He also testified that there were mice in his bedroom, but they did not crawl on him since his bed was up high. Joshua’s sister Faith slept in a “cubbyhole” under the stairs where she placed a board at the bottom of her door in an attempt to keep the mice out. Joshua testified that they set mice traps, but that his father said an exterminator would be too much money.</blockquote>

Mrs. Wallace worked outside the home eighty (80) to one hundred (100) hours a week, but the defendant had not been employed since August or September of 1998 because of his health problems. Specifically, the defendant stated that he had “lyphadenopathy,” a chronic-fatigue type condition which he has self-diagnosed. The defendant also indicated that he was not being treated by a doctor and had not ever received disability because of the condition. The defendant claimed that because of his health problems he could not resume his work as an inventor of high technology products for companies. The defendant testified that because of his condition, he spends most of his time lying in bed trying to get his energy back. He also testified that he spends time working at his computer defending himself in cases brought by the Allentown School District. He testified that he has two (2) Hewlitt [sic] Packard computers, two (2) ink jet color printers, two (2) color scanners, a fax machine and a laser printer, which he uses for his work related activities.

The defendant claimed that the leaks caused the mold growths in the bathrooms, and that they just couldn’t keep up with the cleaning.

The defendant testified that he could not clean the messes up and that it was the children’s responsibility to clean up after themselves. He also stated that cleaning tasks were assigned to the children, and that it was their responsibility to clean.</blockquote>

The defendant’s cellular phone rang in the middle of his testimony, which he claimed to have in order for Mrs. Wallace to receive work related calls from her temporary agency.</blockquote>

Moreover, we believe that the <em>Mack </em>court’s reference to the “common sense of the community” should guide this Court in its decision here. Allowing children to live with such filth and vermin, with no working furnace for heat, and with water running into the electrical box creating a fire hazard, cannot be condoned.

Although CYS and other civil authorities are charged with the duty to “provide for the care, protection, safety and wholesome mental and physical development of children, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301(b)(l.l), their performance of their duty does not absolve Appellant of the necessity to perform his “duty of care, protection and support.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 4304.

The record suggests that the owner lives in Florida and is, thus, an absentee owner. The County of Lehigh has a children and youth agency and the City of Allentown has a housing authority. Since we have only a criminal court record, we do not know why either agency did not earlier intervene. The record manifests that they have now done so. The house has been condemned and the children are in custodial control of the county. The criminal conviction of John Wallace almost certainly will act as a preemptive termination of his parental rights to eight of his eleven children. When the county moves to terminate his parental rights, one cannot suppose any effective defense by a parent who has been convicted of endangering the welfare of the subject children. I submit that it is patent that the children and youth and housing authorities should have been more vigilant and sooner acted to: A) have the children declared dependent and, B) condemn the structure where they lived.</p>

They are no longer ill-housed and their future care, custody and control are subject to judicial order. As to John Wallace, since this is a criminal proceeding, we receive only glimpses as to what ails him. We do not have the benefit of juvenile custody proceedings where his mental and physical status would be investigated and, if necessary, remedial and counseling services provided. As it is, we are left with a picture of either a parent who is overborne by grandiose ideas incapable of practical fruition or one who is simply slothful. In either case, the situation will not be ameliorated by a devastating criminal conviction and the one-year services of a probation officer.</p>
