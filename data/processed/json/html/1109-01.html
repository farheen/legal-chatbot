Dr. Schultz further testified that an MRI examination revealed posterior bulging with nerve foraminal encroachment at the L4-L5 level. Dr. Schultz testified that it was his professional opinion that Claimant’s injuries were a direct result of her work-related injury of March 13,1991 and that she was presently unable to return to her previous type of employment.</p>
