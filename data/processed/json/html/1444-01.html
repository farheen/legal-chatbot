The claim is that the introduction of this coloring matter ivas and is for no functional purpose, but solely for the purpose of distinguishing appellant’s gasoline from the gasoline marketed by other dealers, thus indicating origin. This is claimed to be a trade-mark use of the violet color and in July, 1928, appellant filed, in the United States Patent Office, application for the registration of the violet <a id="p1445" href="#p1445" data-label="1445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1445</a>color for use in gasoline as a tracle-mark for such gasoline, under the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905.</p>

If the mere color of violet applied to gasoline in the manner described, so as to render the entire volume of the gasoline violet-hued, could be treated as a trade-mark, it would result that appellant would secure a potential monopoly for an indefinite period, not simply upon the mark, but upon violet-colored gasoline itself. Such a mark we think would not be a good trade-mark at common law, and, repeatedly, we- have held, following numerous authorities, that, since the registration statute- created no new rights of trade-mark ownership, it did not contemplate the registration of marks incapable of common law ownership. <em>B.
