Specifically, Appellant contends that crucial to its entering the settlement agreement was the fact that Ap-pellees had identified Carl Thelin, P.E., as their sole liability expert, and that Mr. Thelin had produced a report stating that improper maintenance and service of the subject vehicle by Appellant was the cause of the accident at issue. Appellant contends that it was primarily as a result of this report that its insurance carrier decided to settle the case. Appellant further alleges that Appellees’ counsel knew or should have known at the time of the settlement agreement that Mr. Thelin, after an inspection of the vehicle on March 12,1992, and review of the depositions by Appellant’s employees, had changed his opinion and was issuing a separate report as to causation, namely that defective design or manufacture of the van’s steering and suspension system were solely responsible for the loss of control of the vehicle in question. Appellant concludes that this modification of the expert’s report amounts to mutual mistake of a material fact or, in the event Appel-lees or their counsel were aware of the revised opinion prior to execution of the settlement agreement, that the agreement was entered pursuant to fraudulent representations. Appellees counter that Appellant’s allegations of fraud and mutual mistake are, in fact, unsubstantiated claims used by Appellant, as a disgruntled party, to avoid the settlement agreement. Appellees also contend Appellant’s assertions are mischaracter-izations of the facts. Appellees further allege that Appellant was aware that their theories of liability would change subsequent to settlement with Appellant. In addition, Appellees assert that they were not aware of Mr. Thelin’s change of opinion until after final execution of the settlement agreement.</p>

The court reasoned that Appellant had faded to prove that there had been a fraudulent misrepresentation or, in the event there had been a misrepresentation, that Appellant had justifiably relied on the misrepresentation. The court also reasoned that the theory of mutual mistake failed because Ap-pellees were proceeding under several theories of liability against Appellant, and Mr. Thelin’s modified report continued to support several theories of liability (liability for selling a defective product, breaching warranties of fitness and merchantability, and for violating section 402A of the Restatement of Torts) against Appellant even after dropping the negligent maintenance theory. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that Appel-lees were not mistaken as to whether they had a case against Appellant when the settlement agreement was executed and, as such, mutual mistake could not be asserted. In the alternative, the court found that if mutual mistake existed, the nature and effect of the mistake could not be considered material to the settlement agreement. Finally, the trial court stated that it saw no need for an evidentiary hearing after reviewing the pleadings. The court found that the parties thoroughly laid out the history of the case and clearly stated their respective positions on the facts and law, enabling the court to reach a decision without such a hearing. Because we disagree that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary in this instance, we vacate the order at issue and remand for such a hearing.</p>

The trial court made factual findings as to the circumstances surrounding the agreement based solely on the facts set forth in the parties’ petitions, coupled with <a id="p1107" href="#p1107" data-label="1107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1107</a>conjecture as to the intention of the parties in entering same. It is also not apparent from the record as to when Appellees became aware of Mr. Thelin’s revised opinion and conclusions. Because this information is not available by way of official record, and because, even though the negligent maintenance theory was not the only theory by which Appellees sought to recover from Appellant, the other theories asserted would have provided for indemnification by Ford Motor Company, we find that the intent and knowledge of the parties at the time of the agreement are essential to a determination of whether fraud or mutual mistake existed in procurement of the settlement agreement. Since we cannot review the trial court’s actions due to lack of testimony by the parties, we must vacate the order of the trial court and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>
    <p id="b1173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1173.4",1173,[189,1201,750,133]]]'>Order vacated. Case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Jurisdiction relinquished.</p>
