    <p id="b1352-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1352.17",1352,[991,1411,753,375]]]'>Steven’s first contention on appeal is that the State negligently failed to secure and preserve the washing machine top allegedly used in Mannon’s murder.

      <a id="p1295" href="#p1295" data-label="1295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1295</a>During her initial statements to the police on January 12-13, 1992, Gibbons maintained that the murder weapon was a “sink.” Although Gibbons claimed that the “sink” was thrown into a ditch along Interstate 95, she could not locate the object described when police took her to the area she indicated. In fact, the record shows that during the search, the police pointed out the washing machine top to Gibbons, but she replied that it “probably” was not the murder weapon. The police continued to do a thorough search, but could not find the “sink.”</p>
    <p id="b1353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1353.4",1353,[155,868,754,1569]]]'>The police were not informed that the washing machine top might have been the weapon until Nelson’s counsel asked the police to obtain the washing machine top on March 30, 1992, almost three full months after the murder. Steven has not demonstrated that the actions of the police were negligent. <em>See Hammond v. State, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/569/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="569 A.2d 81" data-case-ids="11935719" data-case-paths="/a2d/569/0081-01">569 A.2d 81</a> (1989). The evidence showed that the police proceeded carefully and wholly within the law based on the information available. As soon as the police were aware of the possibility that the washing machine top may have been used in the murder they seized it. Even had they seized it immediately, it is unlikely the washing machine top would have yielded any new evidence. It had sat submerged in water for at least 24 hours prior to the initial discovery of it by the police. This fact would have seriously impaired the ability of the police to remove significant fingerprints, hair, or blood. Further, Gibbons testified that Out-ten, and not Steven, hit Mannon with the washing machine top. Therefore, even had the police pulled the washing machine top out of the ditch immediately upon discovery and not found Steven’s fingerprints on the top, this would not point to Steven’s innocence. Accordingly, the police actions were justified and the Superior Court did not err by refusing to find that the police acted negligently.</p>

Gibbons stated, “I have been lying so much for this trial, I really don’t know what the truth is anymore.” Steven claims that the trial court erred by not striking Gibbons’ testimony, or declaring a mistrial after this admission. Steven asserts that Gibbons was an incompetent witness who did not feel an obligation to tell the truth. He relies generally on <em>State v. Keys, </em>Supr., <a href="/nh/114/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="114 N.H. 487" data-case-ids="1294829" data-case-paths="/nh/114/0487-01">114 N.H. 487</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20615" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="322 A.2d 615">322 A.2d 615</a> (1974), for the proposition that when a trial court is not satisfied that a witness feels obligated to testify truthfully, that witness should be disqualified or her testimony stricken.</p>

First, although a portion of the record reveals that Gibbons lied and knew she lied, the rest of the record amply supports a finding that Gibbons did understand the importance of her oath to tell the truth. Second, this Court in <em>Conlow v. State, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/441/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="441 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="7958034" data-case-paths="/a2d/441/0638-01">441 A.2d 638</a>, 640 (1982), stated that the jury, not the court, is best suited to resolve the conflicts presented by a witness who changes his or her testimony.

In <em>Lawrie, </em>we held that the changes in the statutory scheme in 1991 created such a “significant dissimilarity between the pre-1991 cases and the post-1991 cases” that the former are merely “pertinent” but are “clearly distinguishable” because of the statutory change. 643 A.2d at 1350. The pre-1991 cases required a unanimous jury verdict to impose the death penalty. In the post-1991 cases, it is the trial judge who has the final responsibility for sentencing, and the jury’s recommendation need not be unanimous.

State, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/643/1336-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="643 A.2d 1336" data-case-ids="7874804" data-case-paths="/a2d/643/1336-01">643 A.2d 1336</a>, 1349 (1994), this Court stated “[W]e have concluded in the instant case, on significantly different facts, that there is no constitutional obstacle to the imposition of the death penalty either under the Delaware Constitution or under the United States Constitution.” Outten's claim that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and his reliance' on <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em><a href="/us/458/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="458 U.S. 782" data-case-ids="636586" data-case-paths="/us/458/0782-01">458 U.S. 782</a>, <a href="/us/458/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="458 U.S. 782" data-case-ids="636586" data-case-paths="/us/458/0782-01">102 S.Ct. 3368</a>, <a href="/us/458/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="458 U.S. 782" data-case-ids="636586" data-case-paths="/us/458/0782-01">73 L.Ed.2d 1140</a> (1982), therefore, is misplaced. <em>Enmund </em>invalidated as disproportionate a death sentence where the defendant neither participated in the killings nor intended for the victim to be killed. Here, the jury found that Outten actively participated in the murder. He swung a hammer at Mannon and crushed his skull with a washing machine top.</p>

In <em>Lawrie, </em>the appendix included all first degree murder cases which went to a penalty hearing since 1985, but carefully divided those cases between the pre-1991 cases and the post-1991 cases. The appendix to the instant decision includes as the appropriate universe only the post-1991 cases.</p>
