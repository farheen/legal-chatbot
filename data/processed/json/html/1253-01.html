    <p id="b1290-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1290.10",1290,[1003,491,750,497]]]'>¶ 5 Mr. Mogish testified on cross-examination that only a small part of his training and education pertained to BB guns, and that he only field tested one BB gun while with the Pennsylvania State Police. However, he also stated on re-direct that he owns four BB guns, understands their operation, and has read literature on BB guns, specifically, the use of BB guns and their effects on humans. <em>Id. </em>at 62-64.</p>
    <p id="b1290-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1290.11",1290,[997,1021,754,1072]]]'>¶ 6 We find the trial court did not err in allowing Mr. Mogish to testify as an expert. Aside from his extensive training and education pertaining to firearms in general, he also had some that pertained to BB guns specifically. Additionally, Mr. Mogish testified that he had read literature on air rifle BB guns and their effects on human beings. He further stated that he could testify as to velocities or coefficients of BB guns and/or air rifles. <em>Id. </em>at 65. Mr. Mogish has been qualified as an expert in firearms in seventeen different counties of this Commonwealth, including Lehigh County. Clearly, the witness possessed a reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge on the subject matter under investigation. <em>Marinelli, supra. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting Mr. Mogish as an expert witness in firearms.</p>
    <p id="b1290-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1290.12",1290,[996,2118,750,558]],["BL_1291.1",1291,[171,279,753,488]]]'>¶ 7 Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in allowing Mr. Mogish to testify regarding some experiments he conducted whereby he would shoot a BB gun at a target and measure the velocity and the damage rendered to the target. Appellant objects to this testimony because there is no “correlation of the use of the tin and/or steel cans and the effect of the pellets on them to that which would occur if similar guns were used on the human <a id="p1257" href="#p1257" data-label="1257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1257</a>body.” Appellant’s brief, at 24. We agree with this argument. However, the admission of this evidence is of no consequence since no opinion was offered as to how the tests implicated the ability of a BB gun to inflict serious bodily injury, and the trial court did not rely on it. Indeed, the argument is a red herring, ignoring the other evidence that truly went to the heart of the matter.</p>
    <p id="b1291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1291.4",1291,[172,798,753,1364]]]'>¶ 8 Mr. Mogish testified that he has read articles and publications about injuries caused by BB guns. He related instances where BB guns have killed people by entering the eye socket and traveling to the brain or by missing the breast plate and ribs and striking the heart. He also testified that a BB gun comes with a manufacturer’s warning acknowledging its ability to cause death or serious bodily injury. Additionally, Mr. Mogish referred to a ballistics book utilized by the crime lab during his tenure as a firearms examiner. The book specifically discusses the serious wounds that a person can receive from a BB gun, no matter what the variety.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Based on the foregoing, Mr. Mogish opined to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that a BB gun, no matter the variety, is a deadly weapon in that it is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. N.T., 09/27/04, at 82-86. Thus, Appellant’s focus on Mr. Mogish’s tests is misplaced as there is ample and relevant evidence to support his opinion that a BB gun is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</p>

Appellant filed an omnibus pretrial motion to transfer his case pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6322. Therein, he alleged that he used a BB gun in the commission of the robberies and that a BB gun does not qualify as a deadly weapon as defined by 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2301.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant concludes that this factor removes him from the jurisdiction of the criminal court since a robbery committed by a child where no deadly weapon is used is not an excludable offense under the Juvenile Act.</p>

Of the three victims, one testified that the robbers possessed handguns and a rifle, and that he himself owned a .32 revolver and knows the difference between what a revolver and a handgun looks like. N.T., 09/23/04, at 51, 74. The second victim stated that she was not familiar with weapons at all, but described the weapons as an automatic rifle and a smaller gun. <em>Id. </em>at 81. The third victim stated that the robbers had a machine gun and a handgun, but admitted that he was not familiar with guns. 09/27/04, at 41, 45.

Counsel emphasized that Appellant consistently maintained the weapons were not real guns, but that he possessed a BB gun and his cohort(s) possessed a paintball gun or guns.

Rather, the Commonwealth assumed the burden, presenting testimony from the victims that Appellant possessed a gun. Appellant was the only one who could know with certainty what kind of weapon he used and its whereabouts. If he actually used an item during the robbery that could not be construed as a deadly weapon, the onus was upon him to present it, or evidence relative thereto, to the court to support his petition. A voluntary decision to keep information from the trial court will effectively deny a juvenile of the protections of the Juvenile Act. <em>See Commonwealth v.

First and foremost, in the absence of the weapon, the trial court made a credibility determination to credit the victims’ testimony that they believed the guns to be real. <em>Compare Commonwealth v.

Under that provision, a deadly weapon is one that is “likely to produce death or serious bodily injury.” At the hearing, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of a qualified expert witness who opined to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that a BB gun, no matter if it is pneumatic or carbon dioxide powered, is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. N.T., 09/27/04, at 86. Accordingly, even by Appellant’s own account that he used a BB gun instead of a real gun, he nonetheless possessed a deadly weapon while he committed the robberies. Since Appellant was properly charged as an adult, the trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s motion to transfer his case to the juvenile court.</p>

Our review of the record indicates that Appellant called a forensic psychologist who testified favorably for him, stating that he would likely be amenable to treatment within the juvenile system. However, on cross-examination, the witness also agreed that Appellant had engaged in several incidents for which he was never charged; that he received three misconducts while in pre-trial incarceration, including an assault on another inmate; and that his opinion of Appellant would be affected had he known that Appellant had access to a gun where he was residing, having told the witness he did not possess or have access to guns. Appellant’s mother also testified regarding Appellant’s upbringing and his abusive step-father.</p>

In fact, one individual was victimized twice in two separate robberies. Another victim quit her job, went on medication, and did not leave her house for two months as a result of her victimization. The Commonwealth also called Appellant’s juvenile probation officer, who testified that Appellant would make progress but then would have set backs, used drugs and alcohol while on probation, disregarded other restrictions placed upon him, ran away from his authorized residence, and committed a new crime while on probation.</p>

The trial court concluded that Appellant, who was age eighteen and a half at the time of the hearing, would not be amendable to treatment within the juvenile system. The trial court determined that there was not enough time to address Appellant’s many issues before the juvenile system would lose jurisdiction over him. These issues included his mental health issues, the drug and alcohol use, his prior unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation while on juvenile probation, and a history of absconding from places where he was ordered to stay by authorities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The court noted the impact of the crimes on the victims and on the community, whose businesses were being robbed by a group of masked men wielding weapons. These latter facts were utilized in evaluating the degree of Appellant’s culpability and criminal sophistication. Also, there was some concern for the public because of the lack of guarantee that Appellant would be rehabilitated by his twenty-first birthday when he would be released back into society without further supervision if he was in the juvenile system.</p>
