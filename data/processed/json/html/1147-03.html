While the existence of the gas deposits in the area have been known for a long time, recent developments in drilling techniques have allowed for the potential recovery of dramatically larger quantities of natural gas. Estimates suggest that the area could contain over 489 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, enough to supply the natural gas needs of the United States for fourteen years. The developments in <a id="p1150" href="#p1150" data-label="1150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1150</a>recovery techniques and the proximity of the formation to the energy markets of the east coast cities has created a surge of interest in drilling in the area. Consequently, gas companies in the past few years have offered landowners much more lucrative lease terms than were present in older leases, given the increased competition for drilling rights. This has caused some landowners to review their older leases and question whether the terms provided therein comply with the GMRA.</p>

The court, however, ultimately held that the lease did not violate the GMRA because “[t]he statute in question does not prohibit the inclusion of ‘post-production’ costs to calculate the one-eighth royalty.

Landowners argue that the plain language of the statute does not provide for the net-back method through which post-production costs are subtracted from the sale price at market. Likewise, Landowners assert that the plain language does not state that royalties should be calculated at the wellhead as argued by the Gas Companies. Landowners reject the Gas Companies’ contention that the word “royalty” has developed a technical meaning in the oil and gas industry. Instead, they maintain that the ordinary meaning of the term royalty should be binding in this case. Relying upon standard dictionary definitions, Landowners argue that the term “royalty” is ordinarily defined as “a compensation or portion <em>of the proceeds </em>paid to the owner of a right, <em>as a patent or oil or mineral right.” </em>Landowners’ Brief at 19 (emphasis in original).

Although acknowledging that Pennsylvania has not adopted the First Marketable Product Doctrine, Landowners argue that it can be assumed that the legislature was aware of the century-old duty to market doctrine when it enacted the GMRA in 1979, and thus, intended the GMRA to reflect the doctrine by requiring lessees to bear all the costs necessary to market the gas, which would include the post-production costs at issue in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

    <p id="b1195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1195.6",1195,[147,620,756,1751]]]'>Landowners next look to legislative history to support their claim that the legislature intended for the one-eighth royalty to be calculated at the point of sale. Essentially acknowledging that there is no legislative history regarding the GMRA that is directly supportive of their claim, Landowners look to the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Conservation Law, 58 P.S. § 402, enacted in 1961, which regulated the drilling of natural gas wells more than 3,800 feet below the surface (specifically, below the so-called Onondaga Horizon). In that act, the legislature defined a “royalty owner” as “any owner of an interest in oil or gas lease which entitles him to share in the production of the oil or gas under such lease or the proceeds therefrom <em>without obligating him to pay any costs under such lease.” <a href="/p2d/886/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="886 P.2d 652" data-case-ids="10350078" data-case-paths="/p2d/886/0652-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added). The Landowners contend that the Oil and Gas Conservation Law and the GMRA should be read in <em>pañ materia </em>as they both relate to natural gas leases. Accordingly, they assert that when read together the two statutes provide that landowners “are entitled to the payment of one-eighth royalty of all oil, natural gas, or gas of other designations removed or recovered from the subject real property without obligating them to pay any costs under such lease.” Landowners’ Brief at 7. Landowners contend that “any costs” includes production and post-production costs.</p>

They note that the GMRA is the only statute in the country that provides for a minimum percentage royalty to be paid to a landowner. Landowners contend that the GMRA is a remedial statute intended to prevent deception and exploitation of Pennsylvania property owners by developers. Therefore, Landowners assert that the statute must be interpreted in their favor, and the only way to guarantee the landowner a one-eighth royalty is to base the payment on the amount of money received by the gas company when it sells the gas at the prevailing market price, and not the illusory value of the gas “at the wellhead.” They argue that the market price is an easily determined amount that is not subject to corporate manipulation and inflation of costs. They emphasize that the definition of post-production costs as used in the net-back calculation in the current lease is “without limitation.” Moreover, they assert that use of post-production deductions will merely generate more litigation over the legitimacy of the deductions claimed by the Gas Companies. They contend that it satisfies the remedial purpose of the GMRA to read the statute to prevent the potential exaggeration of post-production costs, which would result in a diminished royalty.</p>

From this language, the Gas Companies contend that the relevant point of reference is the moment the gas is “removed” from the ground, or in other words “at the wellhead.” They assert that natural gas cannot be “removed or recovered” downstream from the point it exits the ground at the wellhead. They also argue that nothing in the GMRA restricts the parties from contracting for a different point of measurement downstream of the wellhead so long as it provides at a minimum for a royalty of one-eighth at the point of removal — the wellhead.</p>

Therefore, to calculate the price of the natural gas at the wellhead (and thus the royalties), they argue that we must work backward from the value-added price received at the point of sale by deducting the companies’ costs of turning the gas into a marketable commodity. As mentioned, this calculation is often referred to in the industry as the “net-back” method of calculating royalties.</p>

Similarly, expenditures for transportation of the gas to the high-demand markets of the east coast cities can earn much higher sales prices than in the fields of Western Pennsylvania. Therefore, by deducting the expenses of production and transportation from the final sales price, one can fairly calculate the price for the unprocessed gas at the moment of removal. They dispute Landowners’ framing of the Lease as involving post-production deductions from the royalty rather than calculations that enable a determination of the royalty at the time of removal.</p>

Prior to the late 1980’s, the role of the producer was to explore for oil and maintain the wells. When the gas came out of the well, the producer sold it to the pipeline company at the wellhead for a federally regulated price. The pipeline company would then assume all the responsibilities of transforming the raw product (sour gas) into marketable natural gas (sweet gas) and transporting it to the market place, where the gas was sold to local distribution companies. The pipeline company would sell the gas at a higher price, given the value added in the process of transforming and transporting it from sour to sweet gas. The producer, however, was paid a price for the natural product when it sold the gas to the pipeline company at the wellhead, and royalties for the landowner were calculated based on that “at the wellhead” price. Therefore, at the time of the enactment of the GMRA in 1979, the wellhead was the point of royalty measurement. Accordingly, the Gas Companies argue that the one-eighth royalty included in the GMRA was one-eighth of the unprocessed value of the gas at the point of removal. The Gas Companies also note that in 1979 almost all jurisdictions presumed that royalties were calculated at the wellhead.</p>

The federal government required pipeline companies to unbundle their transportation services from their own natural gas sales efforts and, in effect, provide common-carriage services to others, including gas producers, who wished to transport natural gas. This has been referred to as the deregulation of the industry. The Gas Companies argue that the Lease’s net-back calculation of royalties merely recreates the allocations that existed at the time the GMRA was enacted when royalties were calculated based upon the price of the raw/sour gas at the wellhead and not based upon the price of valued-added sweet gas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

They assert that valuation of the gas at the wellhead standardizes the royalties, consistent with the statutory language.

The Conservation Law established a regulatory program designed to prevent wasteful development of oil and natural gas wells penetrating the Onondaga Horizon at a depth of 3,800 feet, which is deeper than the wells that had been utilized since the 1850s. They argue that the definition of royalty owner was not intended to address the calculation of royalties, but instead to include as many lessors within the definition as possible.
