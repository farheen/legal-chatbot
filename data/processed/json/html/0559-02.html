The jury found Devos was liable, and determined as well that at the time of the assault, Devos was working in the scope of his employment for the defendant Central Beef Company (Central Beef). Accordingly, the jury’s verdict rendered Central Beef liable to Harris under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Central Beef has now moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b).

As a general matter, a party must move for a directed verdict under Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(a) at the close of all the evidence in order to preserve its right to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under Rule 50(b) if the case is submitted to the jury and decided adversely to the moving party. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b), first sentence; Rule 50(b), Reporters’ Notes. Thus, if a defendant moves for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case, and after denial of the motion proceeds to offer evidence, the defendant waives its right to move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict thereafter if it failed or declined to renew its directed verdict motion at the close of the evidence.

The defendant Devos was employed as a salesman for Central Beef, working in a supervisory capacity in the export division. On the night of August 18, 1991, Devos was in Boston entertaining clients of Central Beef — a family of three from Mexico and a man from Turkey. Devos met the clients at the Park Plaza Hotel in the evening for drinks, and then engaged to take them out for dinner. Through the hotel, he arranged to rent a limousine in order to show the company’s clients some sights of Boston and to bring them to a restaurant. The plaintiff Harris owned the limousine, and was its driver. Harris picked the Devos party<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">3</a> up at the hotel around 8:00 p .m., took them on a tour, and dropped them off at a restaurant in the North End around 9:00 p.m. Harris and Devos arranged that Harris would pick the group up at 11:00 p.m., but Harris gave Devos a telephone number where he could be reached if Devos wanted him to come earlier. The party finished dinner somewhere around 10:30, and Devos as well as another Central Beef employee repeatedly (six times) telephoned the number given by Harris to have him come early, but were unable to reach him; apparently Harris’ pager was not working. Harris arrived at the restaurant somewhat after 11:00, having learned from his mother that Devos had been trying to reach him earlier. The Central Beef party was waiting for him on the sidewalk, and he “screeched” to a stop next to them. Harris jumped out of the car, and said angrily to Devos, “you shouldn’t have spoken to my mother that way.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">4</a> He and Devos had some further sharp words, and then the party took off. Devos was angry at Harris because he believed the delay in Harris’ arrival back at the restaurant interfered with his clients’ enjoyment of the evening and therefore with the evening’s success from a business relations perspective. Harris was driving quite fast on the trip back to the hotel, and Devos’ other associate asked Devos to ask that he slow down because the speed was causing discomfort to the clients. Devos put his hand on Harris’ shoulder and told him to slow down. Harris said, “get your fucking hand off my shoulder," but it appears Harris did slow down.</p>

Soon thereafter, the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>limousine arrived at the hotel. Harris opened the passenger door, the clients got out, and they walked into the hotel. Devos also got out, reached into the car from the driver’s side and took Harris’ keys.</p>
    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[246,469,981,403]]]'>Both Harris and Devos then went inside the hotel lobby, where Harris notified someone working at the desk that Devos had his keys. An argument between Harris and Devos ensued, in the lobby, with Devos continuing to demand that Harris apologize to the clients , and Harris demanding his keys. It is not clear where the clients from Mexico were at that point, but at least the man from Turkey could be found to have been in the vicinity of the argument, and listening to it.</p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[248,895,978,577]]]'>At some point, in response to the insistence of the hotel staff, Devos threw Harris’ keys on the floor; he did not want to hand Harris the keys because he felt Harris had embarrassed him in front of his clients and colleagues. Harris stated that he was now going to call the police, and Devos then hit Harris, knocking him to the ground. Devos then jumped on top of Harris to hold him. Hotel security guards removed Devos from Harris, who got up with the words, “Now, I’m going to kick your ass.” In response, Devos thrust his foot out, and kicked Harris in the eye. Harris fell back down, and an ambulance was called. Harris sustained a fracture to the orbit of his eye, as well as a broken nose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">5</a>

Devos spoke about the incident with his superior, one Lang, whom he identified as the head or owner of Central Beef. However, the company did not discipline Devos and continued to employ him at the time of trial in 1995. Devos’ associate, Tejeda, who could have been found to be somewhat involved as well in the dispute with Harris, was not disciplined either, and worked for Central Beef until 1993 when he got abetter job. Devos testified that he got into the fight with Harris because he perceived Harris as interfering with his job of successfully entertaining the company clients.</p>

And the evidence was also sufficient for the jury to conclude that in getting into a fight with Harris, Devos was motivated at least in part by the goal of serving his employer: Devos testified in substance that he struck Harris because of his frustration and anger over what he perceived as Harris’ interference with Devos’ ability to leave the company’s clients with a positive impression of the evening, and thereby of the company Devos represented; the jury were entitled to credit this testimony.
