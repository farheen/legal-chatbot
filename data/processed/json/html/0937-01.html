These improvements were necessary in order for Michael and his then girlfriend, now wife, Gail, to finance the purchase of the property from the Browns. Once the above improvements were completed, the bank approved Michael and Gail’s loan application. Brown co-signed the note that evidenced Michael and Gail’s debt.</p>

    <p id="b998-4" data-blocks='[["BL_998.4",998,[187,1424,756,754]]]'>Brown was both a grantor and grantee of the land. During the transfer of the land to Michael, Gail, and herself as joint tenants, the deed description was altered. Although Brown testified that she did not alter the deed description and did not know who did, the trial court found instead that she was a party to the redrawing of the deed and that the redrawn deed was “part of an effort to ... expand the lot_” Such a finding is supported by the record and within the court’s province as the trier of fact. <em>See Gray v. Gray, </em><a href="/a2d/609/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="609 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="12119209" data-case-paths="/a2d/609/0694-01">609 A.2d 694</a>, 697 (Me.1992) (due regard given to the trial’s court opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses and weigh the evidence).</p>
    <p id="b998-7" data-blocks='[["BL_998.5",998,[181,2218,758,517]]]'>There is further evidence to support the trial court’s conclusion that Brown took part in a scheme with Michael and Gail to enlarge the boundaries of her land. Brown acknowledged that the lot was too small for a home under existing town ordinances. The town code would not have allowed for the installation of a septic system on the lot. Brown was able to procure a permit to install one only because the land was grandfathered under current regulations.</p>
    <p id="b998-8" data-blocks='[["BL_998.6",998,[996,224,752,794]]]'>It was reasonable for the court to have inferred that Brown wished to enlarge her lot. The evidence was clear that Michael and Gail took steps to increase the size of the lot to conform it to that indicated in the new deed description. They bulldozed a boundary wall and brought fill onto Martin’s and Robbins’s property as if it were their own. Pins in locations conforming to the boundaries as described in the new deed description mysteriously appeared on the land. Gail called Martin to ask him if he had installed the pins. Martin denied having done so and, on inspection, found that brand new pins had indeed been placed. Martin testified that as mysteriously as the pins had appeared, they disappeared.</p>
    <p id="b998-9" data-blocks='[["BL_998.7",998,[992,1041,754,696]]]'>Although Brown testified that she did not visit her son very often and was unaware of any work done on the property by Michael and Gail until after it had been completed, this is inconsistent with her prior actions of buying the land for her son and making improvements on it so that he could obtain financing. She even co-signed the note evidencing his debt. The court’s findings that Brown was part of the intentional effort to expand the boundary of the lot that she partially owned onto the adjoining land of Martin and Robbins and thus was liable for trespass is not clearly erroneous, nor does it constitute an error of law.</p>
    <p id="b998-10" data-blocks='[["BL_998.8",998,[987,1776,754,755]]]'>Moreover, contrary to Brown’s further contention, there was more than sufficient evidence to support the court’s conclusion that the acts of trespass for which Brown was liable were willful or knowing. Whether conduct is willful or knowing for purposes of section 7552 is a question of fact and will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Walsh v. Johnston, </em><a href="/a2d/608/0776-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="608 A.2d 776" data-case-ids="7931884" data-case-paths="/a2d/608/0776-01">608 A.2d 776</a>, 778 (Me.1992); <em>Guilmet v.

An effort to deliberately expand a boundary, to bulldoze a stone wall that served as a boundary marker, to dump truckloads of fill, and cut trees located on adjoining land certainly can properly be found to be willful or knowing.</p>
