The jury awarded the ap-pellee, Cheryl Minott, $44,825 in compensatory damages for the wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering of her husband, Paul Minott. Otis argues that the presiding Justice erred in two evidentiary rulings, in his instructions to the jury and in his denial of motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a mistrial. We affirm the judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Prior to the time of Minott’s death, AHS had commissioned F. W. Cunningham &amp; Sons (Cunningham), a general contractor, to perform extensive renovations in the building. Otis had subcontracted to convert a freight elevator in the rear of the building into an elevator suitable for passenger service and to install another elevator in the building.</p>
    <p id="b1376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.4",1376,[221,763,755,1134]]]'>Otis began work on the alteration of the rear elevator in March of 1972, removing the original biparting hoistway doors, the call buttons which directed the elevator to each floor and the door interlocking devices which prevented the hoistway doors from opening unless the elevator car was at the landing and the car from moving unless the doors were closed. Otis installed a smaller, passenger-sized door frame and sill at each landing. In late March, Otis’ employees went on strike and work on the rear elevator was not resumed prior to Minott’s death. As a temporary measure during the strike, Cunningham removed plywood barriers that it had placed against the open entrances to the shaft and installed at each landing a swinging hoistway door made of plywood. Cunningham equipped each door with a self-closing mechanism and with a lock which could be opened by a key whether or not the elevator car was present at that level. Cunningham then used the elevator to transport building materials.</p>
    <p id="b1376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1376.5",1376,[1025,272,746,849]]]'>AHS moved its operations into the building in late June of 1972 and received from Cunningham the two keys to the rear elevator. Minott, a mail clerk for the office services department of AHS, was given one of these keys because he needed to use the elevator to transport a mail cart from floor to floor several times a day to pick up and to deliver mail throughout the building. On the day of the accident, Minott had taken the elevator to the third floor to deliver mail. While Minott was on that level, another AHS employee used the elevator to transport some items from the basement to the fourth floor. Minott then returned to the elevator with his mail cart, unlocked the door and stepped into the empty elevator shaft.</p>

    <p id="b1377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1377.8",1377,[147,963,751,836]]]'>Otis contends the presiding Justice erred in excluding this conversation because it was offered for the non-hearsay purposes of showing that Cunningham had notice of the risk of using the uncompleted elevator and that Otis had no knowledge of the elevator’s use and did not authorize its use. Otis also maintains that the evidentiary ruling constituted prejudicial error because the excluded testimony was of crucial relevance to its position at trial that it was not in control of the elevator at the time of Minott’s death. It is clear that the admission of this evidence to show notice, lack of knowledge and lack of authorization was not barred by the operation of the hearsay rule because the extrajudicial statements were not offered for their truth. <em>See </em>M.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>
    <p id="b1377-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1377.9",1377,[150,1824,750,558]]]'>Even though the proffered testimony was improperly excluded as hearsay, the error of the presiding Justice did not prejudice a substantial right of Otis. <em>See </em>M.R. Evid. 103(a). “Prejudicial injury occurs only if the evidence excluded was relevant and material to a critical issue and if it can with reason be said that such evidence, if admitted, would probably have affected the result or had a controlling influence on a material aspect of the case.” <em>Towle v. Aube, </em>Me., <a href="/a2d/310/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="310 A.2d 259" data-case-ids="8027631" data-case-paths="/a2d/310/0259-01">310 A.2d 259</a>, 264 (1973).</p>

The excluded statements are at best ambiguous on the issue of knowledge. Even if the statements showed a lack of knowledge, they would have only a cumulative effect because Hanson testified that Otis never knew the elevator was being used. Similarly, Otis cannot claim that the excluded testimony prejudiced its ability to show that it had not authorized Cunningham to use the elevator because the presiding Justice <em>allowed </em>Hanson to testify that Otis had never given Cunningham such permission. Furthermore, whether Otis knew of, or permitted, the use of the elevator in late April or early May is only marginally relevant to the issues of knowledge and authorization at the time of the accident in July. Otis’ employees returned to the job site ten days before the accident, and one employee testified that he saw Minott using the elevator. The rebuttal impact of the excluded evidence would therefore be slight. Because the proffered evidence was marginally relevant and largely cumulative on the material issue of control, the exclusion of this evidence did not constitute prejudicial error.</p>

On appeal Otis contends the presiding Justice erred in admitting this testimony on the grounds that the testimony was irrelevant, that the witnesses were incompetent to testify on the issue of control between contractor and subcontractor, that the subject matter was not a proper area for expert testimony because it did not involve specialized knowledge and was not helpful to the jury and that the testimony was unduly prejudicial because the issue of who had control over the elevator at the time of the accident was crucial to its case.</p>

This “ultimate issue” rule was predicated on the theory that allowing such testimony usurped the function of the fact finder, creating the danger that the opinion of an expert or other influential witness would be given dispositive weight by the jury. <em>See generally </em>C. McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence § 12 (2d ed. E. Cleary 1972). The rule has been criticized as “unduly restrictive, pregnant with close questions of application and the possibility of misapplication, and often unfairly obstructive to the presentation of a party’s case,” <em><a href="/us/293/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="293 U.S. 498" data-case-ids="3933440" data-case-paths="/us/293/0498-01">id.,</a> </em>and its use as a blanket prohibition has been largely abandoned, <em>see, e. g., </em>F.R.Evid. 704.

This does not lower the bars to admit all such opinions. Under Rules 701 and 702 opinions must be helpful to the trier of fact and Rule 403 provides for exclusion of time-wasting evidence.

    <p id="b1378-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1378.6",1378,[1023,757,748,920]]]'>Under the rule, therefore, an expert witness may state his opinion on an ultimate factual issue in the case so long as his testimony satisfies all the requirements for the admission of expert testimony. Similarly, the rules would allow even a lay opinion on an ultimate fact provided the preconditions to admissibility have been met. An expert witness may be incompetent to give his opinion on an ultimate issue because such an opinion may not involve specialized knowledge and would not be helpful to the jury under M.R.Evid. 702 or because the probative value of the opinion is substantially outweighed by the countervailing considerations of M.R.Evid. 403. Thus, under Rule 704, whether to allow into evidence an opinion on an ultimate issue rests within the sound discretion of the presiding Justice.</p>

In support of this first ground, Otis points to evidence that Minott had notice of the risk and failed to exercise reasonable care in view of the danger. This evidence, it is urged, conclusively shows that the negligence of Minott was the sole intervening proximate cause of his death. In support of its second claim, Otis points to evidence that Cunningham had installed swinging doors with locks at each level, had given AHS personnel the keys to these doors and had sanctioned AHS use of the elevator. Otis maintains that this evidence conclusively establishes that either Cunningham or AHS was in exclusive control of the instrumentality that caused the harm.

There is no way to determine whether the statements were in fact improper, whether the context in which the statements were rendered heightened or diminished their prejudicial effect or whether the closing arguments of opposing counsel adequately clarified any misconception.

Cunningham, in furtherance of its own contract with Associated Hospital Services (AHS) to perform extensive renovation to the building, did use the elevator which was then undisputably under its control to transport building materials. After AHS moved into the building in late June, Cunningham delivered to AHS two keys to the rear elevator for the use thereof by its employees in the course of their employment and AHS employees, including Mr. Minott, did use the elevator during the strike by Otis employees and thereafter. The only evidence in the case was to the effect that this use of the elevator by AHS was not authorized by Otis. One witness testified that, after the strike had ended and Otis had resumed work on the front elevator, but before any work was done on the rear elevator and during the period of some six days prior to the Minott accident, he, as well as another Otis employee, had noticed that Mr. Minott was using the elevator. He denied, however, that he became aware that Minott had a routine schedule that he would follow with his cart. The evidence does not disclose how soon before the tragedy did this single observation of Minott’s use of the elevator by the two Otis employees take place, nor whether this fact was reported to whoever was in charge for Otis at the time. Furthermore, Emerson testified that the only use to which the rear elevator could have been put legally during the period of renovation was such operation only as was necessary to perform the work of renovation itself, and that only by the contractors working thereon. Thus, its operation by AHS authorized by Cunningham was without legal sanction, the old state certificate or license to Sears and Roebuck having been suspended automatically when work on the conversion commenced and the new one to AHS not having been issued.</p>

The custom or usage in the trade did not involve any scientific or professional skill, such as the methods of treatment by physicians or surgeons, or technical knowledge as may be required in dealing with electrical appliances or the like. <em>Farmers’ Ginnery &amp; Mfg.

Furthermore, the jury was not informed concerning the respective duties of the general contractor vis-a-vis the subcontractor in relation to their individual or joint control of the elevator, nor regarding Otis’ possible duty to assume control following the end of the strike and the time for so doing. The jury was not told what effect knowledge of Minott’s use of the elevator by some Otis employees who were not in charge of the renovation project for Otis could play in activating the duty in Otis to resume control of the elevator.</p>

How else explain the jury’s specific percentile finding that Mr; Minott was 30% negligent, Cunningham 30% negligent and Otis 40% negligent? Even though the parties did not object to the charge, nor request specific instructions respecting the reference matters, the submission of the case to the jury, postured as it was on the existence of the usage and custom in the trade respecting control of an elevator under renovation, tied in with Emerson’s testimony that Otis had control of the elevator, without adequate instructions as to the effect thereof, was inconsistent with substantial justice and a reversal is in order to protect Otis’ right to have the jury consider the facts under appropriate instructions. <em>Hixon v.
