This argument is unavailing because the NCP was amended.

Under this provision, medical bills causally related to a work-related injury must be paid by employer. However, the obligation to pay does not begin to run until bills are submitted on the proper medical forms with a monthly medical report.

Claimant sought reimbursement for traveling expenses based largely upon his assertion of his residence with his parents in Derry. The WCJ found that Claimant was not entitled to such reimbursement to attend physical therapy or doctor appointments because Claimant's residence was not the location from which mileage was submitted.
