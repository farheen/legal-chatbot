(“New Town”), Fort Lincoln Realty Corp., Inc. (“the Realty Corp.”), Michele V. Hagans, and Barbara A. Jones (collectively “appellees”). The trial court dismissed appellants’ breach of contract claims against appellees after concluding that appellants were incidental beneficiaries of a contract entered into by a District of Columbia government agency, then known as the Redevelopment Land Agency (“the RLA”) and New Town. Subsequently, the trial court dismissed appellants’ remaining claims after granting ap-pellees’ motion for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the appellants’ non-contract claims were not separate and distinct claims from their breach of contract claim, and that appellants did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that any specific duties were owed to them by appellees.</p>

Mr. Hagans died in a plane crash, in 1984. Appellee, Michele Hagans, is the daughter of Mr. Ha-gans and has been the President and Treasurer of New Town and the Realty Corp. since April 1984. Appellee, Barbara Jones, inherited 33.33% of the stock in New Town and the same amount of the stock in the Realty Corp. Prior to the end of the probate of Mr. Hagans’ estate, Ms. Jones sold her prospective right to the stock of the Realty Corp. to Ms. Hagans.

    <p id="b1108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1108.5",1108,[200,1252,757,1185]]]'>In an order dated February 17, 2004, the Honorable Michael L. Rankin granted, in part, defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, pursuant to Super. Ct. Civ. Rule 12(b)(6). After hearing oral arguments on the issue and reviewing supplemental briefs filed by the parties regarding the test for determining whether a third-party claimant may enforce a government contract, Judge Rankin concluded that “plaintiffs are incidental beneficiaries of the LDA,” and thus, are precluded from enforcing the government contract. In addition, Judge Rankin determined that plaintiffs “are specifically precluded by operation of section 3.4 of the LDA from bringing a contract action to enforce the terms of the LDA.” The judge declined, however, to dismiss appellees’ non-contract claims, stating that “where a plaintiff alleges a distinct claim, she may proceed on that claim even though another claim arising from the conduct is barred.”</p>

Dixon, Jr., in essence, reaffirmed Judge Rankin’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim. In addition, he dismissed the plaintiffs’ remaining claims on July 29, 2005, granting the motion of New Town, the Realty Corp., and Ms. Hagans for judgment on the pleadings (treated as a motion for summary judgment), and the motion of Ms. Jones for summary judgment. The judge concluded that “plaintiffs’ claims are mere re-characterizations of the previously dismissed breach of contract claim, and that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue the remaining common law and statutory claims alleged in the complaint.” Judge Dixon explained that “Judge Rankin did not rule on the issue of whether plaintiffs’ non-contract claims were simply a re-characterization of plaintiffs’ breach of contract allegations.” The judge found that “plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that their multiple claims are independent of the dismissed breach of contract claim.” In addition, Judge Dixon determined that plaintiffs did not offer sufficient evidence to support their statutory claims and failed to establish that defendants owed them any duties outside of the contract.</p>

They claim intended beneficiary status because they are “residents of <a id="p1063" href="#p1063" data-label="1063" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1063</a>Fort Lincoln” (and minority residents), and because “the express provisions in Article VII [of the LDA] evince a clear intent by the parties to benefit plaintiffs and other residents of Fort Lincoln.” They maintain that appellees failed to implement several provisions of the LDA designed to benefit them. They assert, for example, that New Town (a) “failed to offer members of the local minority community the opportunity to purchase 15 percent of the common stock of New Town [ ], in violation of Section 7.7(a) [of the LDA]”; (b) “failed to create a Non-Profit Corporation which would perform community services for the Fort Lincoln area during the redevelopment project, in violation of Section 7.8(a) [of the LDA]”; and (c) “failed to ‘provide an opportunity to minority group members to acquire at least 25% of the ownership interest in the free standing retail and personal service shopping space in the Town Center,’ in violation of Section 7.5(c) [of the LDA].” Furthermore, they argue that § 3.4 of the LDA is limited to the provisions of Article III, and is not applicable to Article VII. Appellants assert that “[t]he circumstances surrounding the formation of the LDA further demonstrate that [they] are intended beneficiaries of the contract.” They point to a statement by Mr. Hagans, “the soon-to-be President of New Town[],” indicating that “[a]ll members of the Board of [New Town] have a copy of the [LDA],” and that they were “familiar with the provisions of the document, particularly Article VII, which relates to the responsibility of the developer to provide opportunities for the minority community to benefit from the development of Fort Lincoln.” They also cite a statement by the then executive director of the RLA concerning the creation of “a non-profit Community Corporation” which would be “controlled ... by Fort Lincoln residents,” within two years of the completion of the Project.</p>

Under the introductory paragraph to this section, “[t]he Redeveloper agrees that it will promote, in cooperation with the [RLA], the District of Columbia government, and Federal and other public and private agencies and organizations, to the fullest extent consistent with sound economic development, opportunities for minority owned and operated businesses in the Town Center and Community Malls.” Thus, §§ 7.5 is earmarked for minority business enterprises. The Complaints, filed in 2002 and 2003, do not identify any of the plaintiffs as owning a minority business enterprise. Nevertheless, appellants appear to suggest that because § 7.5(b) indicates that “the Redeveloper will create or cause the creation of a new real estate sales and management company” to handle “the sale, rental, management and maintenance ... of all Private Improvements owned or held for sale or lease by the Redeveloper,” they are intended beneficiaries of the LDA, as evidenced also by § 7.5(b)(i) which specifies that “at least 25% of the ownership of the Real Estate Company shall be vested in the Non-Profit Corporation described in [§ ] 7.8.... ”</p>

Similarly, § 7.8(b) which addresses a homeowners’ association or community corporation, does not catapult appellants into intended beneficiaries. Section 7.8(b) provides for “a study of the alternative methods of ownership and operation of the physical infrastructure of the [Fort Lincoln urban renewal project], including certain community facilities.” The “physical infrastructure” was not limited to housing such as condominiums with which appellants are primarily associated. More importantly, § 7.8(b) did not mandate the creation of a homeowners’ association or a community corporation. Rather, § 7.8(b) left it to the Redeveloper’s discretion as to whether such an association or corporation should be created: “Based upon the results of this study, the Redeveloper shall consider the possibility of establishing a homeowners’ association or community corporation ... for the purpose of owning and operating such facilities.... ”</p>

Similarly, the general statement by RLA’s executive director about the establishment of “a non-profit Community Corporation” which would be “controlled ... by Fort Lincoln residents,” within two years of the completion of the Project, cannot be considered as expression of Mr. Hagans’ and RLA’s intent to make these appellants, associated with condo unit ownership, intended beneficiaries of the LDA, as opposed to incidental beneficiaries.</p>

Rather, appellees are incidental beneficiaries, part of the public and the 16,000 residents of the Fort Lincoln community who might realize some benefit from implementation of the LDA. <em>See </em>Restatement, § 315 cmt. (a). Furthermore, as appellees emphasize, the LDA is a government contract. And, “a promisor who contracts with a ... governmental agency to do an act or render a service to the public is not subject to contractual liability to a member of the public [or a member of the 16,000 person Fort Lincoln community] for consequential damages resulting from [any] ... failure to perform ...” any promise reflected in the LDA. <em>See </em>Restatement, § 313(2).</p>

Appellees highlight Article III of the LDA, especially § 3.3 which not only places the right to bring judicial enforcement action in the RLA and the Redeveloper, but also gives the RLA and the United States the task of “protecting the interests of the community and the other parties, public or private, in whose favor or for whose benefit [ ] agreements and covenants have been provided.” They further emphasize § 3.4 which explicitly states that “no person other than a party to the Agreement or a successor or assign, shall have any right to enforce the terms of this Agreement against a party, its successors or assigns.” But appellants argue that the Article III provisions are limited to Article III, and do not preclude them from bringing this enforcement action. Article III of the LDA covers “restrictions upon use of property,” and therefore it is possible to interpret that Article as pertaining only to agreements and covenants related to or running with the land, and not to the entire LDA. Yet, the trial court concluded that by its plain words, particularly the explicit use of the term “this Agreement,” meaning the entire LDA, § 3.4 shows that the contracting parties intended for the Article III enforcement provisions to apply to the entire LDA, and to prohibit the action brought by appellants.</p>

In the case of a default and a failure to cure, “an aggrieved party may, in addition to exercising any other rights specified in this Agreement, institute such proceedings as may be necessary or desirable in its opinion to cure and remedy such default or breach, including, but not limited to, proceedings to compel specific performance of its obligations by the party in default or breach where not inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement.” Section 10.4 addresses “defaults by the Redeveloper with respect to this Agreement” and alleged defaults, including those relating to Article VII, §§ 7.5(b) (opportunities for minority business enterprises, and the creation of the Real Estate Company) and 7.8 (creation and funding of the Non-Profit Corporation or the Homeowners’ Association). In the event of a failure of the Redeveloper to cure any alleged default in response to a written demand by the RLA, “the Agency at its option may terminate the Agreement,” but the Redeveloper may elect to <a id="p1069" href="#p1069" data-label="1069" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1069</a>continue to develop “Parcels previously conveyed to [it].” And, the Agency and the Redeveloper would retain the right “to the benefits of, and to enforce, all rights, obligations, conditions, covenants and other provisions of the Agreement relating to or affecting the development of all Parcels which have been conveyed to the Redevel-oper or with respect to which the Redevel-oper has made the election to continue....” Although Article X apparently does not include language identical to that appearing in § 3.4 which explicitly states that “no person other than a party to the Agreement ... shall have any right to enforce the terms of the Agreement against a party ...,” it contains no provision which suggests, even remotely, that the parties intended any third party to have the right to enforce the LDA. Nor do we see any implicit provision in the LDA which reasonably may be interpreted to reflect an intent on the part of the RLA and the Redeveloper to permit appellants such as those involved here to bring an action to enforce the LDA.</p>

Hagans, Jr.” (Ms. Jones).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_28" id="ref_footnote_1_28">28</a> Appellants alleged that Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones were unjustly enriched because 25% of the shares of the Realty Corporation were never transferred to the Non-Profit Corporation as required by Article VII of the LDA, and because they retained 100% of the shares of New Town, and Ms. Hagans wrongfully retains “49 percent of the ownership interest in the Realty Corporation <a id="p1076" href="#p1076" data-label="1076" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1076</a>that was never transferred to the NonProfit Corporation as required by the LDA”; therefore, a constructive trust should be imposed on those assets. We agree with the trial court that the discovery rule does not apply to the unjust claim against Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones, thereby tolling the statute of limitations. As the trial court found, “the notice of appointment of a personal representative of the Estate of [Mr. Hagans Jr.] was published in 1984” and claims against the heirs and legatees of his estate had to be “presented within 6 months after the date of first publication of notice of the appointment of personal representative,” under D.C.Code §§ 20 — 903(a)(1); and pursuant to § 20 — 1303(b)(1), the right of a person to recover assets improperly distributed to a decedent’s heirs “shall be barred one year from the date of distribution of all assets of the estate and satisfaction of all known claims against the estate.”</p>

The court also concluded that Ms. Hagans did not waive the statute of limitations defense. Therefore the applicable statute of limitations barred the unjust enrichment claims against Ms. Hagans and Ms. Jones. The court also “conclude[d] that the [unjust enrichment] claim against [Ms.] Hagans is barred as a re-characterization of the breach of contract claim and for lack of standing....”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_29" id="ref_footnote_1_29">29</a>

Here, appellants’ theory of unjust enrichment is based on the premise that they are intended beneficiaries of the LDA, and in part on the assumption, as they argued in their motion for partial summary judgment, that “[u]n-der the [LDA], Mr. Hagans, as a member of a minority group, should have held a maximum of 51 percent of the shares of the Realty Corp. and the profits from the remaining 49 percent of the shares should have gone to the Non-Profit Corporation” for appellants’ benefit.
