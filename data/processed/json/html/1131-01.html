Appellant contends principally that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the grounds (1) that the government failed to prove corporate ownership of the property in question, and (2) that the defense was denied its right to cross-examine the central government witness and to impeach him with testimony concerning allegedly inconsistent prior statements.

Saunders then approached appellant and demanded the return of the meat. When appellant denied having the steaks, Saunders reached into his trousers and, after a short scuffle, retrieved them. Saunders took appellant into the storage room where he asked appellant to pay for the meat (which no longer was fit for sale). When appellant refused to pay, the police were called. Officer Bobby Dickens arrived shortly thereafter, and arrested appellant for attempted petit larceny.</p>

The government need only allege and support with some evidence the basis for the complainants’ possession of the stolen object. In this case, the government alleged Safeway’s corporate status in the information, and offered evidence that Safeway was licensed to do business in the District of Columbia. Such facts also are ones of general knowledge. The evidence adduced was sufficient to establish that Safeway had a greater possessory interest in its merchandise than did appellant. As the government put some evidence of Safeway’s corporate status in the record, it met its burden of proving the complainant’s possession as an element of the crime of larceny.</p>

Defense counsel repeatedly attempted to question Saunders concerning a conversation which the manager previously had with a defense investigator. In response to the government’s objection to this line of questioning, defense counsel proffered that Saunders had made statements to the investigator which were inconsistent with his testimony; Saunders allegedly had admitted to remembering the incident only vaguely, and then had recalled certain facts differently from the way he related them at trial.

There, defense counsel attempted to question a police sergeant who was present at the scene of the crime concerning a statement he purportedly made to defense counsel’s investigator. The apparent purpose for the questioning was to expose prior inconsistent statements made by the sergeant. We reasoned that as the sergeant was the only government witness who testified to appellant’s crime, his testimony, if believed, would be sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt. Consequently, the sergeant’s credibility was crucial, and appellant was entitled to cross-examination for the important purpose of seeking to impeach him <a id="p1135" href="#p1135" data-label="1135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1135</a>based upon prior inconsistent statements.

For that reason it is necessarily exploratory; and the rule that the examiner must indicate the purpose of his inquiry does not, in general apply. * * * It is the essence of a fair .trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop. ... To say that prejudice can be established only by showing that the cross-examination, if pursued, would necessarily have brought out facts tending to discredit the testimony in chief, is to deny a substantial right and withdraw one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.</blockquote>
