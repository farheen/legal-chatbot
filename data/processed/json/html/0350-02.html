Tatelbaum, from the practice of law for ninety days as the result of his having filed a false and fraudulent insurance claim<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in violation of Florida Rules of Professional Conduct 3-4.3, 3-4.4, 4—8.4(b), and 4-8.4(c). The first two rules define what actions may be taken when a member of the Florida Bar commits a criminal act, but since respondent entered into a plea agreement that withheld an adjudication of guilt in Florida they do not constitute a basis for reciprocal discipline here <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>and we are concerned only with his violations of Rules 4 — 8.4(b) and 4-8.4(c) as those two rules are substantially similar to D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct 8.4(b) (criminal act reflecting adversely on an attorney’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness) and 8.4(c) (conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation). Respondent admitted the charge and entered into an <em>agreement </em>with Florida disciplinary counsel under which he would be suspended for ninety days, placed on probation for one year, and required to attend an ethics course and to complete forty hours of approved <em>pro bono </em>legal services. The Florida Supreme Court accepted the agreement and, as noted, imposed the proposed suspension as well as the identified conditions.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[178,1280,753,975]]]'>Respondent promptly self-reported his Florida suspension and this court issued an order temporarily suspending him per D.C. Bar R. XI, § 11(d), and referring the matter to the Board on Professional Responsibility (“Board”) for its recommendation on whether identical, greater, or lesser discipline should be imposed as reciprocal discipline, or whether it would proceed <em>de novo. </em>The Board submitted its report on October 18, 2006, and it recommends the imposition of functionally identical reciprocal discipline (followed by probation and subject to the same conditions imposed in Florida). Bar Counsel informed us on November 7, 2006, that he takes no exception to the Board’s report and recommendation, and respondent has not filed any exceptions.</p>
