At the hearing on the motion, the government’s sole witness was an experienced vice squad investigator of the Metropolitan Police Department. He testified that at 10 p. m. on July 30, 1975, he was riding on the passenger side of an unmarked police car with two other police officers on 14th Street, N.W. As the police car slowly passed a small foreign car, the officer noticed the passenger in the foreign car holding a manila envelope, measuring “about three by four, three by five” inches, <a id="p1150" href="#p1150" data-label="1150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1150</a>in his left hand and a piece of white paper, measuring “about two by three inches”, in his right hand. The' officer testified that from his prior training at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs as well as his experience from about 400 previous arrests for drug violations he believed that the manila envelope was a packet of marijuana and that the person holding it was preparing to roll a marijuana cigarette. Therefore, he informed the other officers in the car of what he saw and the foreign car was soon pulled over.</p>

The driver and the passenger, who was identified at trial as appellant, were thereupon placed under arrest. A subsequent search of a shoulder bag and the seat where appellant was seated recovered four manila envélopes containing marijuana.</p>
