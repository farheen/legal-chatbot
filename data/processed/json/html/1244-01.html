Under the terms of the MSA, Appellee was to provide computer software and associated equipment that facilitated inventory management services for Appellant’s automobile dealerships. The length of the Agreement was for a period commencing with the date it was signed on March 27, 1998, and continued until all Schedules <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> were completed, which translated into an expiration date of September 20, 2006 <em>(e.g., </em>Schedule 68004129 — Appellant’s contract to purchase equipment, software, and/or services from Appellee — commenced on September 20, 1999, and terminated eighty-four months later, <em>ie., </em>September 20, 2006). Stated otherwise, Appellant was obligated to utilize Appellee’s computer services for a fixed term set forth in the Agreement, as that term was extended pursuant to the Schedules. Therefore, when Appellant notified Appellee that it was terminating the MSA on March 24, 2005, Appellee filed a complaint alleging that Appellant was in default, which entitled Appellee to an early termination fee. <em>See </em>Appellee’s Amended Complaint, 3/31/06, at ¶ 9.</p>

Appellant also alleged that it was not in default when it gave Appellee notification of not renewing the equipment lease agreements (Schedules) and the MSA. Further, Appellant asserted that the MSA and Schedules both expired in accordance with their provisions in June of 2005 — the point in time when Appellee recovered “all its leased equipment (upon which the software and other computer programs were resident),” and Appellee’s repossession foreclosed Appellant’s exposure to liability. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Amended Answer and New Matter, 5/4/07, at ¶¶ 15,16.</p>

Appellant filed a notice of appeal but no Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement was ordered by the trial court. Appellant raises two issues for our review, the first of which states: “The [trial c]ourt committed an error of law in granting the Motion for Summary Judgment. Genuine issues of material fact necessary for the determination of the subject of this action exist, and the [trial cjourt improperly granted summary judgment.” <em>See </em>Appellant’s brief, at 4.</p>

Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof on an issue, he may not merely rely on his pleadings or answers in order to survive summary judgment. Failure of a non-moving party to adduce sufficient evidence on an issue essential to his case and on which he bears the burden of proof establishes the entitlement of the moving party to judgment as a matter of law. Lastly, we will review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party.</blockquote>

More particularly, Appellant’s vice-president and controller each contacted Appellee’s representatives in writing and telephonically concerning the termination of the 1998 Agreement and Schedules in 2003 (vice-president) and 2005 (controller), the latter of whom interacted with Appellee’s representatives (Joe Coss, Diane Sebastian, “Jim,” and Allen Collins) from July 27, 2005, through October 21, 2005, and produced credit adjustments issued by Appellee’s representatives in favor of Appellant in the amounts of $7,290.38 <a id="p1251" href="#p1251" data-label="1251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1251</a>(on October 31, 2005), $12,665.82 (on November 17, 2005), and $4,741.93 (on December 11, 2005). <em>See </em>Appellant’s <em>AFFIDAVIT OF DIANE HOUSHOLDER, </em>¶¶ 7, 8, and 10-13.

The record reveals that Appellant gave Appellee oral/written notice of termination subsequent to Appellant’s initial effort to terminate the Agreement in April, 2003. Appellant asserts in the affidavit of its controller that, through oral/written communications following the notice of March 24, 2005, it evidenced continuously an intention to terminate the Agreement at the next expiration date of July 7, 2005. <em>See </em>Appellant’s <em>AFFIDAVIT OF DIANE HOUSHOLDER, </em>10/10/07, at ¶¶ 3, 4, and 6. In reply, Appellee denied that Appellant’s March 24, 2005 notification to terminate and not renew the documents in June of 2005 was in accordance with the Agreement. <em>See </em>Appellee’s Reply to Amended New Matter, 4/24/07, at ¶ 15. Further, Appel-lee denies that its representatives had the authority to bind it to an early termination of the Agreement. <em>See </em>Appel-lee’s Motion for Summary Judgment, 9/12/07, at ¶ 13. Thus, a genuine issue of material fact exists, <em>i.e., </em>whether Appel-lee evidenced an intent to terminate the Agreement through its representatives’ conduct; to-wit: 1) Communicating with Appellant regarding closing out the account; 2) Crediting Appellant’s account; 3) Removing equipment from Appellant’s worksites; and 4) Discontinuing invoicing services. As a result, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Appellee as that right is not clear and free of doubt. <em>See Accu-Weather, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/644/1251-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="644 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="7883070,945904" data-case-paths="/a2d/644/1251-01,/pa-super/435/0093-01">644 A.2d at 1255-56</a>.
