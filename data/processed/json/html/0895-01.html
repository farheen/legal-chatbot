He received a suspended sentence of imprisonment and was placed on probation. On August 18, 1999, Lanton filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to D.C.Code § 23-110 (1998), alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On March 22, 2000, the trial judge issued a written order in which she denied Lanton’s motion without a hearing. Lanton’s appeals from his conviction (No. 99-CM-245) and from the order denying his post-trial motion (No. OO-CO-487) were consolidated by order of this court. We conclude that the trial judge erred in denying Lanton’s § 23-110 motion without a hearing.</p>

When Mrs. Lanton arrived at home early that afternoon, it appeared that her husband was attempting to clean up the apartment. In doing so, Mr. Lanton was apparently disposing of some old furniture and clothing. Mrs. Lanton became concerned that Mr. Lanton was throwing away clothes that still fit the children, including, in particular, some shoes that belonged to the Lan-tons’ daughter. According to Mrs. Lan-ton, her husband ridiculed her concerns.</p>

So he left.” Mrs. Lan-ton testified that she locked her husband out and refused to let him in, but Mr. Lanton managed to kick the door open, bragging that he was a “mighty man.” When Mr. Lanton went into the kitchen to try to cook some food, Mrs. Lanton insisted that her husband “can’t cook that food because that’s my food, I just bought it.”</p>

According to Mr. Lanton, his wife was “pissed” that he had seemingly thrown the shoes away, and she began to yell at him, tried to throw out his books, and generally became very aggressive. Mr. Lanton testified that he left the apartment to “chill out” in the hallway, but that his wife followed him and continued to scream at him and berate him. Mr. Lan-ton eventually returned to the apartment to cook some food, but his wife, who was still in a rage, insisted that it was her food because she had paid for it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> According to Lanton, his wife punched him in the face, continued to yell at him, and tried to beat him. Mr. Lanton denied striking his wife, and he insisted that, throughout the entire episode, he simply attempted to protect himself and to ward off his wife’s blows. According to Mr. Lanton, his wife was the aggressor and initiated the physical confrontation. Lanton indicated that he was trained in martial arts, and he implied that if he had wanted to fight his wife, she would have got by far the worst of it.</p>

Judge Davis pointed out that the wife “admitted yelling loudly at the defendant and this was not an issue,” but the judge did not attempt to analyze the significance of the alleged content of the wife's verbal barrage, and especially of the alleged baiting. Moreover, even if the judge discredited Mr. Lanton’s claim that he never struck his wife at all, the neighbors’ proposed testimony tended to show that the wife was the aggressor, which could constitute a defense even if the husband did strike the wife while fighting back. <em>See Johnson v.

We recognize that a busy trial judge may understandably be reluctant to schedule a hearing when there is no assurance that potential witnesses are prepared to testify.

But in <em>Spencer, </em>the defendant apparently relied entirely on his pleading, and did not attach statements of potential witnesses. We do not believe that the <em>Spencer </em>decision was designed to announce a universal rule applicable to cases, such as this one, in which so much of Lanton’s motion was supported by detailed proffer.</p>

But it was a bench trial, and the judge concluded that the testimony of Manuel and Johnson, assuming it would have conformed to their statements,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> would not have changed her decision to credit the complainant’s testimony as to who was the first aggressor (the judge had focused on that issue at trial, personally questioning both wife and husband as to “who was the first person to use force against the other”), and thus would not have changed her verdict. Since in my view the judge explained this conclusion satisfactorily, she was not obliged to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>
    <p id="b947-16" data-blocks='[["BL_947.15",947,[971,1638,755,195]],["BL_948.1",948,[186,284,756,1798]]]'>Manuel purportedly had heard (in the majority’s words) a “verbal barrage” by Mrs. Lanton in the hallway outside the apartment. But, as the judge pointed out, <a id="p906" href="#p906" data-label="906" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*906</a>the trial evidence was unequivocal — from both husband and wife — that the first blow had been struck inside the apartment; the spouses differed only as to who had delivered it and at precisely what point in their argument. Thus Manuel could shed only pale light on the first aggressor issue. Johnson’s professed observations were perhaps slightly more probative because he, an adjoining neighbor, had heard Mrs. Lanton through the thin apartment wall “baiting [her husband] to fight her.” Accepting this auditory observation as true, however, the trial judge still considered it thin gruel in suggesting who had initiated the violence. Indeed, what had impressed the judge most about the wife’s credibility at trial was her candor in admitting (in the majority’s words) that she had given “as good as she got.” She testified that when appellant began hitting her, she hit back repeatedly because, as she said, “[n]obody is going to put their hands on me without me hitting back.” Appellant, by contrast, had professed to be blameless in the altercation — in the judge’s view, “the picture of calm, intervening only to prevent the [wife] from becoming out of control.” The judge had also found him to be “arrogant” on the stand and in effect contemptuous of his truthtelling duty, asserting “that he just doesn’t remember much about the day,” in contrast to the wife who “presented a far clearer memory of this day.”</p>

As she stated, “it would not have altered [her] assessment of the complainant[’s] and the defendant’s credibility” on who was responsible for the fray. I would leave the matter at that, rather than remand for a hearing whose outcome seems to me inevitable.</p>

It is disturbing that appellant, through his appointed counsel, failed to provide sworn affidavits from these two witnesses, or for that matter himself, in support of their factual allegations. The majority agrees, pointing out that the case "would be in a different posture ... if the trial judge had given Lanton a specified brief period to present his allegations and the allegations of his witnesses in affidavit form, and if Lanton had failed to comply.” <em>Ante </em>at 903-04 n. 10. There is language in our cases suggesting the trial court is not bound to afford such an opportunity. <em>See, e.g., Fields v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/698/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="698 A.2d 485" data-case-ids="12007366" data-case-paths="/a2d/698/0485-01">698 A.2d 485</a>, 489 (D.C.1997) (“The fact that Fields has not provided an affidavit from any of these witnesses is itself a sufficient ground to reject without a hearing allegations of ineffectiveness premised on the failure to call them.”). I do not make an issue of this failure, however, because our decisions have not been clear on whether a formal affidavit is required or only some "other credible proffer” of what the witness would say. <em>Ready v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/620/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="620 A.2d 233" data-case-ids="7353160" data-case-paths="/a2d/620/0233-01">620 A.2d 233</a>, 235 (D.C.1993); <em>see also Ellerbe v.

Here, as the majority notes, Manuel's statement (at least) was framed "as a kind of informal affidavit,” lacking only the oath or an assertion that it was true under penalty of perjury. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 1746">28 U.S.C. § 1746</a>.
