It also provided that Wein-stein would coordinate valuation seivices and testimony before the Board and/or the trial court, and/or any other higher court in order to achieve an equitable assessment. <em>Id. </em>With regard to the appeal process, the First Agreement provided that “[w]hen the appropriate authorities propose assessments which Weinstein deems reasonable, Weinstein in its sole opinion, will proceed toward its acceptance and discontinue the appeal process.” With regard to legal services, “[a]ll legal expenses for the appeal process will be the responsibility of Weinstein,” and Weinstein “will coordinate all legal services with the counsel” for the Districts. <em>Id. </em>In return for the services, Weinstein was to receive a contingency fee “predicated upon the assessment increase” of 40% of the assessment increases of each individual property appealed for a two (2)-year period, for the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 tax years. <em>Id.</em>

After perfoim-ing an analysis and evaluation, Weinstein prepared a list of underassessed properties for both Districts. The school boards of the Districts then reviewed the list and determined which properties should be the subject of a tax assessment appeal. (R.R. at 306a, 340a). The school boards then approved the filing of appeals relating to the properties identified by Weinstein. (R.R. at 340a). Weinstein completed all the necessary forms with respect to the subject properties and forwarded the same to the Districts’ solicitor, John Stott (Stott). <em>Id. </em>Stott reviewed the paperwork, obtained the necessary signatures of the Districts’ representatives and filed the paperwork with the Board. <em>Id.</em>

Additionally, the Second Agreement characterized Weinstein’s fees as “commissions” or “commission based,” even though the “commission” remained at “forty percent (40%) of the assessment increases of each property.” <em>Id. </em>Further, the Second Agreement did not address expenses, except to state that the Districts “may deduct legal expenses from any commissions due Weinstein.” <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b1316-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1316.8",1316,[986,794,756,1051]]]'>Ultimately, the trial court issued separate but identical opinions and orders granting the taxpayers’ motions, entering judgment in favor of them and against the Districts and dismissing all of the Districts’ appeals. The trial court concluded that both the First Agreement and Second Agreement between the Districts and Weinstein were champertous. In addition, the trial court concluded that the doctrines of champerty and maintenance could be raised as a defense. The trial court found that Weinstein assumed the position of a real party in interest, that it lacked standing to maintain the action and that, therefore, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. After the trial court’s entry of the opinions and orders, the cases were consolidated and the Districts proceeded to file notices of appeal with the trial court.</p>

With regard to the First Agreement, the trial court reasoned that the First Agreement met the first element of the test for cham-perty in that Weinstein was not involved in the tax assessment appeals as a property owner or in any other legitimate capacity. Weinstein’s sole interest was “merely to make a profit through the speculation on the outcome of the assessment appeals, an interest which has no legitimacy in the law.” (Trial court opinions at 8). The trial court reasoned that the First Agreement met the second element of the test for champerty in that the agreement specifically stated that “all legal expenses for the appeal process will be the responsibility of [Weinstein]. [Weinstein] will coordinate all legal services with counsel for the district.” (Trial court opinions at 9). Finally, the trial court reasoned that the First Agreement met the third element of the test for champerty in that the agreement provided that Weinstein would not receive compensation for its efforts unless the assessment litigation resolved in favor of the Districts for an increase in the tax assessment of the property. (Trial court opinions at 9-10). Weinstein was receiving proceeds from the suits in the form of 40% of the increased tax revenue for a two-year period. <em><a href="/a2d/747/1242-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="747 A.2d 1242" data-case-ids="11481566" data-case-paths="/a2d/747/1242-01">Id.</a> </em>With regard to the changes that were set forth in the Second Agreement, the trial court found the Second Agreement to be “a transparent attempt to disguise the bargained for relationship already existing between he [sic] and the [Districts],” as contracted for in the First Agreement. (Trial court opinions at 10). It further found that “the only difference between the first and second contract is semantics.” <em><a href="/a2d/747/1242-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="747 A.2d 1242" data-case-ids="11481566" data-case-paths="/a2d/747/1242-01">Id.</a></em>

If the record does not establish that Weinstein paid any expense in a particular case, then the trial court cannot find by motion for summary judgment that the Districts entered into a champertous agreement with regard to that particular case.

Champertous is a derivative of the term "champerty,” which is defined as "a bargain between a stranger and a party to a lawsuit by which the stranger pursues the party’s claim in consideration of receiving part of any judgment proceeds.” Black’s Law Dictionary 231 (6th ed.1990). It is further defined as "one type of 'maintenance,' the more general term which refers to maintaining, supporting, or promoting another person’s litigation.” <em><a href="/a2d/702/0878-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="702 A.2d 878" data-case-ids="11895202" data-case-paths="/a2d/702/0878-01">Id.</a></em>

Moreover, summary judgment is only appropriate when, after examining the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party clearly establishes that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Salerno.</em>

The Districts also argue that the trial court erred in concluding that Weinstein had no legitimate interest in the litigation, the first prong above. We reject this argumenl because our review of the record indicates that the trial court was correct when it determined that Weinstein's sole interest was "merely to make a profit.” (Trial court opinions at 8).</p>

However, this Court has recognized circumstances under which the doctrine of champerty is cause for dismissal of tax assessment appeal cases. <em>See Clark v. Cambria County Board of Assessment Appeals, </em><a href="/a2d/747/1242-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="747 A.2d 1242" data-case-ids="11481566" data-case-paths="/a2d/747/1242-01">747 A.2d 1242</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2000). This Court notes that the trial court in the instant action wrote that the facts of the case before it "are not distinguishable from the <em>Clark </em>case....” (Trial court opinions 15). We wish to note that we view the facts of the cases as being significantly different, given that the Districts and their solicitor were involved in the appeals in question in a more active manner than were the taxpayers in <em>Clark.</em>
