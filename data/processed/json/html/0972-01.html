Ma-tula was in danger of losing one parcel due to a judgment entered against her in an unrelated lawsuit. A sheriffs sale was scheduled on this property, which caused a great deal of distress to the elderly Ma-tula. Matula had been represented in connection with the unrelated lawsuit by attorney Rex McQuaide; but just days before the sheriffs sale was scheduled to take place, Matula retained Roush, who is also an attorney, to arrange for a stay of the sale. The trial court, apparently believing Matula was merely attempting to delay the proceedings,. noted that Matula was represented by McQuaide and refused to permit Roush to enter an appearance or present his motion. Prior to the sheriff sale, Matula sold Roush the property in question for $76,000, the amount due and owing on the judgment against her. Ma-tula subsequently filed a complaint in equity seeking to have the transfer declared null and void. Following a hearing, the court determined that Roush had exercised undue influence over Matula in obtaining the property. As a result, the court entered an opinion and order on August 11, 1998 declaring the sale null and void and requiring Roush to transfer the property to Matula. (R. at 33.) Roush did not file post-trial motions from this opinion and order; rather, he filed a notice of appeal on September 8, 1998.</p>

In rebanee on <em>Donegal Mutual Ins. Co. v. State Farm, </em><a href="/pa-super/377/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="377 Pa.

Super. 171" data-case-ids="704447" data-case-paths="/pa-super/377/0171-01">546 A.2d at 1214</a>. Nothing in Rule 1517(a) requires the court’s adjudication to be in a particular form or indicate that post-trial motions are required. Rule 227.1 was specifically enacted to serve this function of notifying the parties and their counsel of thé procedure to be followed upon conclusion of trial. Ostensibly the Majority distinguishes our Supreme Court’s holding in <em>Lane Enter</em>

I find the procedural posture of this matter is indistinguishable from <em>Lane Enterprises. </em>Unlike the cases cited by the Majority, the trial court here took no definitive action that either precluded Appellant from filing a motion for post-trial relief or engendered confusion. In fact, Appellant does not even suggest that he was misled by the court or was not given an opportunity to file for post-trial relief.</p>
    <p id="b1029-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1029.4",1029,[123,970,754,1083]]]'>¶ 6 Further, I note that Appellant, in his Brief on Reargument, concedes that post-trial motions were necessary. He does not seek to avoid waiver because the trial court created procedural confusion that placed him on the “horns of a dilemma” about whether an appeal or post-trial motions should be filed. Rather, he claims that the post-trial function was satisfied because he filed a 1925(b) Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal to which the trial court filed an opinion. He relies on this court’s decision in <em>Jara v. Rexworks, </em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">718 A.2d 788</a> (Pa.Super.1998). Appellant’s Brief on Reargument at 10-11. I agree with the Majority’s analysis on the inapplicability of <em>Jara, </em>as set forth in footnote 6 on page 978-79 of its opinion. Since Appellant failed to file post-trial motions, I would find the issues waived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">10</a>
