The trial court scheduled a hearing on the petition for involuntary termination of parental rights and confirmation of Mother’s consent.

The trial court confirmed Mother’s consent and terminated her parental rights as to Child by order entered August 23, 2002. The trial court then appointed counsel to represent Father and counsel to act as a child advocate. The court rescheduled the hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights involuntarily. At the rescheduled hearing on October 4th, the trial court heard testimony on the issue of involuntary termination of Father’s parental rights.
