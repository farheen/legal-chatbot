    <p id="b867-4" data-blocks='[["BL_867.4",867,[183,1146,751,1371]]]'>It has been argued in this case as it was in <em>In re Caulk, supra, </em>and <em>Thor, supra, </em>that starving oneself is <em>not </em>an act <em>of </em>suicide but by some leap of logic constitutes merely setting certain natural forces in motion. The same argument might be presented in the event that a prisoner should slash his wrists with a razor blade and then resist all efforts to staunch the bleeding. The similarity between the two instances is that the person who desires to end his or her life deliberately sets a force in motion that "will be fatal unless intervention occurs. We believe that the state has a right, and indeed a duty, to intervene in such circumstances. It has been declared by the Legislature of this State in G.L.1956 (1993 Reenactment) § 42-56-l(b) that the Department of Corrections has been established “to provide for the custody, care, discipline, training, treatment, and study of persons committed to state correctional institutions * * *.” We believe that in such circumstances it would be in total disregard of this duty to stand idly by while a healthy adult decided to end his or her life by starvation just as it would if he or she decided to end his or her life by some more dramatic means such as hanging, slashing of wrists, or swallowing some type of poison.</p>
