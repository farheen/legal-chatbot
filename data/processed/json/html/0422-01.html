Pursuant to Rule 13, M.R. Crim.P., the two indictments were ordered tried together, a procedure to which Mr. Buzynski agreed. Unlike past practice, the Justice presiding granted the defendant’s motion to “bifyrcate” the trial, the purpose being, as stated by defense counsel, “so there will be two issues of fact, the question of factual guilt and mental capacity be separated from the jury and given to them [sic] on different occasions.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the conclusion of the initial segment of the trial dealing only with “factual guilt,” the jury was instructed on the elements of both robbery and arson, including the requisite criminal intent. The jury then answered affirmatively two questions phrased as follows : “Does the jury find that the defendant . . . did commit the crime of Robbery [arson] as alleged in the indictment?” The same jury, not having been previously informed of the plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease, was then presented conflicting evidence bearing on the defendant’s mental capacity, but •found him mentally competent.
