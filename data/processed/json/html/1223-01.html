In the patentee’s method, a sheet of light textile fabric, such as muslin, is <a id="p1225" href="#p1225" data-label="1225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1225</a>placed in tlie interior of a mold, the textile fabric is then covered, as stated by the patentee, with “caul (preferably the veil of fat from slaughtered animals),” the patentee then deposits a layer of meat composition, then a layer of cheese, the surfaces of which have been treated with gelatin to render them adhesive, and then another layer of meat. The extended portions of the caul and the textile fabric not covered by the meat-cheese loaf are folded over the top surface of the loaf. The loaf is then compressed in a closed mold where it is subjected to a cooking process, after which it is chilled. The loaf is then removed from the mold and the textile fabric is removed therefrom. In the patentee’s process, although the cheese is not entirely surrounded by the meat composition, it is entirely surrounded by the caul. The patentee states in his application that—</p>

I do wish to make it plain herein however that in the art of making a food product whose essential parts consist of meat portions and cheese portions, I believe myself to be first to have so constituted the bar that it is of close grain, firm and uniform structure, and that in the slicing of said bar, each slab, as severed, is of unitary or homogeneous structure, the cheese portion thereof being not too easily separable from the meat portions.</blockquote>

In the patentee’s method, a mold is lined with foil, after which plastic cheese of the desired quantity is poured therein ■so that, as stated by the patentee, “when the body of meat is inserted into the cheese, the cheese will surround the meat body. The foil may then be folded around the cheese.” The patentee states that the meat may be a solid piece properly cooked or a meat loaf composed of .ground meat which “may be cooked either before or after the formation of the [meat] loaf.” After the meat-cheese loaf is formed, it is heated in an oven. The patentee further states that the surfaces ■of the body of meat are grooved in order to provide a greater adhering surface for the cheese.</p>

The tribunals ■of the Patent Office further rejected the product claims (Nos. 7 and 10) on the patent to Parsons, the Primary Examiner stating, in which view the Board of Appeals concurred, that there was no invention in merely reversing the relative positions of the meat and the cheese.</p>

Applicant has never disclosed what is meant by ‘cured’ meat as used in the specification,” and that such chilling step was intended to modify the meat and did not “essentially affect the process of preparing the meat-cheese loaf.”</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[221,768,1326,385]]]'>In support of the patentability of the appealed claims, it was apparently argued by counsel for appellant before the Primary Examiner,, as it is argued here, that the patentee Kuhner teaches that it is necessary to use a gelatin binder in order to secure proper adhesion between the meat and the cheese, whereas, in appellant’s process, a gelatin binder is unnecessary and is not. used, and that the patentee Kuhner encloses his-xneat-cheese loaf in “caul,” whereas, in appelllant’s process,, “caul” is not used.</p>
    <p id="b542-6" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[265,1167,1135,44]]]'>In reply to those arguments, the Primary Examiner stated:</p>

However, none of the claims as worded precludes the use of such a binder. <em>The omission of the hinder and its attendant function is moreover not invention. If the cheese is completely surrounded by a- coherent mass of meat, obviously no hinder is necessary to keep the cheese in place.</em>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b542-8" data-blocks='[["BL_542.8",542,[221,1489,1323,198]]]'>It has been further argued that Kuhner surrounds the meat-cheese bar with fat before cooking. Again the claims do not preclude this step. Moreover, no invention is seen in omitting the fat if desired, with its function of protecting the bar. It will be noted applicant teaches that the loaf may subsequently be encased in fat. [Italics not quoted.].</blockquote>
    <p id="b542-9" data-blocks='[["BL_542.9",542,[217,1711,1324,695]],["BL_543.1",543,[128,214,1326,93]]]'>It is contended here, among other things, by counsel for appellant that the patentee Kuhner does not disclose appellant’s process, because the cheese contained in the patentee’s meat-cheese loaf is ixot entirely enclosed within the meat as called for by the appealed claims; that the patentee covered the surfaces of his cheese with gelatin as an adhesive to bind the cheese and meat together; that appellant has obtained the same or even better results by eliminating the step of applying gelatin to the surfaces of the cheese; and that, therefore, his method and the product obtained thereby involve invention. In support of that contention, counsel cites the case of <em>Lawther </em>v. Hamilton, <a href="/us/124/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3524530" data-case-paths="/us/124/0001-01">124 U. S. 1</a>,1888 C. D. 209. Counsel further contends that if'the patentee Kuhner “were to omit his step of coating with an. adhesive he would have a loaf which is not integrated and which would fall apart in marketing or hx seiw-ing. Applicant’s process does not call for this step, yet by the claiixxed <a id="p1227" href="#p1227" data-label="1227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1227</a>metliod separation is prevented. This does not sound like the omission: of an element along with its attendant function.”</p>
    <p id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[131,314,1327,450]]]'>In reply to the examiner’s observations in his statement to the' Board of Appeals, counsel states in his brief that, although appellant discloses in his application the idea of enclosing his cheese-meat loaf in a layer of fat for the purpose of retaining “the moisture within-the loaf,” the patentee Kuhner discloses the use of caul, which is very different from ordinary fats, and that ordinary fats “have an insulating influence and contribute far more structural support than does, caul, but the point here is that in the Kuhner process it is essentiaL to use the caul. In appellant’s process it is not required.”</p>
    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[132,772,1325,284]]]'>In answer to that argument of counsel, it would seem to be sufficient to say that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the use of fat or caul served any purpose in the Kuhner process that would not be served by the use of fat in appellant’s process. In either instance the fat or caul serves to furnish some support for the loaf and to retain the moisture therein.</p>
    <p id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.6",543,[132,1073,1326,651]]]'>That the use of fat as an enclosure for meat-clieese loaves or cheese-meat loaves is optional is clearly apparent from appellant’s application. Furthermore, appellant states in his application, as herein-before noted, that the finished cheese-meat loaf is “encased within a natural or artificial casing and is ready for sale.” Obviously the casing is intended to serve both as a support for the loaf and to retain moisture therein. We are of opinion, therefore, that the omission of the step of enclosing the meat-cheese loaf in caul, disclosed in the patent to Kuhner, is merely the omission of an element together with its intended function. Such omission does not involve invention. <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Chase Elevator </em>Co., <a href="/us/159/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 U.S. 477" data-case-ids="5700238" data-case-paths="/us/159/0477-01">159 U.
