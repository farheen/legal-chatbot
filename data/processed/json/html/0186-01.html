The lottery was supervised by the General Assembly, certain of whose members were appointed to serve as managers for some of the lotteries, but by the 1820s the General Assembly began to delegate the supervision of lotteries to professional managers. Following the ratification of the Rhode Island Constitution in 1843, new lotteries were prohibited and the use of this method of funding public improvements ended.

The Lottery Commission operated continuously from 1974 until the present under the management of directors appointed by the Governor and approved by the commissioners. A previous director was John P. Hawkins, who also served for a time as the first chairman of the commission. Mr. Hawkins was succeeded by Gerald S. Aubin. Both Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Aubin testified in the Superior Court concerning their duties and the nature of the commission’s operation. Another witness was Professor Patrick T. Conley, a noted historian who has written extensively on the constitutional and political history of the State of Rhode Island from its Colonial beginnings to modern times. The trial justice based his findings of fact upon this testimony, as well as extensive documentary evidence presented by the parties.</p>
    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[181,1545,757,1091]]]'>The present litigation arose as a result of a dispute between the Governor and the commission in respect to the authorization of an increase in the number of video lottery terminals (VLTs) to be allowed at Newport Grand Jai Alai and Lincoln Greyhound Park, which was owned by Burrill-ville Racing Association, Inc. On April 26, 1999, the Lottery Commission voted five to four to authorize this increase despite the opposition of the Governor, who appeared at a meeting of the commission to oppose the proposal to increase the number of VLTs. Those commissioners who voted in favor of the expansion were members of the Legislature who had been appointed either by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or by the Majority Leader of the Senate. Those voting against the additional VLTs were the three persons appointed by the Governor, who were joined by one member of the Legislature.</p>

In the course of the litigation, the owners and operators of the Newport Grand Jai Alai and of Lincoln Greyhound Park were added as defendants in this action. The Senate and the House of Representatives intervened as parties defendant. The Governor was joined as a party plaintiff— intervenor by the Attorney General. The parties agreed that pending a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the commission would refrain from implementing its vote to increase the number of VLTs. A preliminary injunction was issued by a justice of the Superior Court. This preliminary injunction was vacated following the issuance of an opinion by this Court in <em>In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor (Rhode Island Ethics Commission </em>— Separation <em>of Powers), </em><a href="/a2d/732/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="732 A.2d 55" data-case-ids="11545783" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/0055-01">732 A.2d 55</a> (R.I.1999).</p>

The trial justice went <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>on to state: “Accordingly, this Court is constrained to and does find that the plaintiffs’ traditional separation of powers argument must fail.”</p>

The trial justice observed with complete accuracy: “There is no question * * * that in connection with actions and votes at the Lottery Commission, none of the foregoing occurs.” This theory was derived by analogy from the United State Supreme Court’s opinion in <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v.

The trial justice was completely correct in finding as a fact and holding as a matter of law that the Constitution placed the regulation of state-run lotteries entirely in the hands of the General Assembly without giving any role to the Governor. Such participation as was accorded to the Governor was given by reason of legislative delegation of such power so that the Governor was authorized to appoint three members of the commission and also to nominate the director subject to the approval of the members of the commission.

Our dissenting colleague undoubtedly will raise the cry that this agency is not independent because it has a majority of members who are legislators. For that same reason although it contains some individuals appointed by the Governor, it is not an executive agency. The short answer to this argument is that nothing in the Rhode Island Constitution prohibits the appointment of legislators or their designees to an administrative agency to which the Legislature has delegated a portion of its power to administer and regulate lotteries in this state. We must also be reminded that the Rhode Island Legislature (unlike the Federal Congress) need not look to the state Constitution as a source of authority by virtue of its historical plenary power (preserved in both the 1843 and 1986 Constitutions). It may exercise any power unless prohibited in this Constitution. <em>See Kass v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, </em><a href="/a2d/567/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="567 A.2d 358" data-case-ids="7347836" data-case-paths="/a2d/567/0358-01">567 A.2d 358</a>, 361 (R.I.1989). The Rhode Island Constitution does not prohibit the appointment of legislators to administrative boards and commissions. These boards and commissions, once appointed pursuant to valid legislative enactments in which the principles of bicameralism and presentment have been fulfilled, then may exercise all the powers that administrative agencies have tradir tionally exercised in both the federal and state systems of government.</p>

All parties agree that there is no separation of powers issue in this case and the claim of violation of the principle of separation of powers must fail. Consequently, there is no inhibition against the delegation of the General Assembly’s constitutional power to an administrative agency. This issue was not even considered by the majority of the Court in <em>Chadha. </em>Justice White was the only member of the Court who considered the effect of the decision upon administrative agencies. He pointed out unequivocally that the Congress had the power by appropriate legislation to delegate portions of its authority to administrative agencies. The Lottery Commission is an administrative agency created by legislation passed by both Houses of the General Assembly and signed by Governor Philip Noel. Our dissenting colleague expresses some criticism of Governor Noel for having signed such legislation. We do not believe that Governor Noel could be characterized by anyone, including our colleague, as a “shrinking violet.” To suggest that an administrative agency could not exercise its functions without in each case having from the General Assembly specific approval through bicameralism and presentment would be to doom all administrative agencies to impotence.

Thus, for the same reasons that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly invalidated such egregious legislative attempts to bypass the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Federal Constitution and to invest legislative officials with executive or legislative power, we should strike down this law as violating our State Constitution, containing in all aspects substantially the same provisions that caused the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Metropolitan, Chadha, Bowsher, </em>and the <em>FTC </em>cases to do likewise. Indeed, far from crafting what the majority calls “a somewhat ingenious doctrine,” the trial justice applied settled principles of constitutional law to the Legislature’s attempt to evade the State Constitution’s restrictions upon the exercise of its powers when he declared the Lottery Commission’s VLT vote <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>to be unconstitutional. The only “somewhat ingenious doctrine” at work here is the separation of powers and checks and balances provided for in our State Constitution. Moreover, the majority’s suggestion that “[a]ll parties agree that there is no separation of powers issue in this case and [therefore] the claim of violation of the principle of separation of powers must fail” is belied by the fact that both the Governor and the Attorney General have filed legal briefs in this case that fairly bristle with myriad separation-of-powers arguments concerning why the General Assembly’s creation of a Lottery Commission dominated by sitting legislators violates the separation-of-powers provisions in our State Constitution.</p>

It has even been suggested by the House of Representatives in one of its briefs to this Court that, “under our constitution, the judicial and legislative departments are independent coequal branches of government” subject to the federal doctrine of separation of powers, but not so with respect to the “diminutive” executive branch. But just as a teacher should not sit by ' and idly watch while a big schoolyard bully beats up the smallest kid in the class, so too this Court should not twiddle its thumbs while the Legislature oversteps the constitutional limits of its powers and tramples upon the “diminutive” executive department. And lest any dispassionate observer be tempted to conclude otherwise, we are not parties to some faustian bargain with the General Assembly whereby, in return for the Legislature’s largesse in allowing the Judiciary to function as an independent, coequal branch of government, the Court is obliged to wash its hands of any constitutional responsibility to check the Legislature’s periodic propensity to overstep the constitutional limits on its powers and to exercise the executive power that our constitution has distributed away from that department and vested instead in the executive branch of government. On this defining legal subject, a judicial policy and practice of legislative appeasement will not bring constitutional peace in our time. And however “diminutive” the executive branch may appear when it has been shunted aside into the looming shadows cast by the legislative department, the State Constitution still vests it and not the General Assembly with all the state government’s executive power. Thus, in my opinion, the Court has not only taken a wrong turn in deciding this case the way it has, but also, by failing to heed our state charter’s fundamental directional signposts that specify how the Legislature must execute its powers, it both has lost its constitutional way and condoned a particularly insidious form of legislative lawlessness that will haunt our state for years to come.</p>

But hereafter, who and/or what is going to stop the General Assembly from simply forming some type of a commission composed, for example, solely of the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate and empowering it (and, thus, these individual legislators) to enact whatever laws they deem expedient — say on education, the environment, or taxation? In the future, moreover, why should the General Assembly or any controlling subgroup thereof subject its will to the risk of a gubernatorial veto or to passage by both houses of the Legislature? And why should legislators have to submit controversial legislation to the inevitable public vetting that occurs when proposed bills are exposed to the usual legislative process? Indeed, why not allow the General Assembly simply to create a so-called “Legislative Leadership Commission” (LLC), appoint the legislative leadership as its sole members, and let them decide by themselves what laws to enact via administrative votes, resolutions, or rulemaking? In other words, why fool around with the rest of the Legislature, the Governor, or the Supreme Court — let alone with bicameralism and presentment limitations established by the citizens of Rhode Island — when an LLC, a Lottery Commission, or some other such legislative proxy or facsimile will suffice to finesse this whole constitutional kit and caboodle?</p>

Instead of a popularly elected legislature enacting lottery-related laws passed by both houses, recording those votes in a public journal of its proceedings, and then presenting the legislation to the Governor for his or her approval or veto, a commission controlled by a small subset of legislators appointed by the Legislature’s leadership is running a mega-gambling operation that is raking in hundreds of millions of dollars without popular government approval of its regulations and in defiance of the constitution’s bicameralism, public journal, and presentment requirements.

First, its article 6, section 15 power to regulate lotteries is contained in the part of the constitution that addresses “the legislative power.” Thus, it contains no authorization whatsoever for the General Assembly to execute any laws that it may pass pertaining to the regulation and/or to the proscription of lotteries. And contrary to the majority’s assertion, the State Constitution vests no power in the General Assembly concerning “the supervision of lotteries in the State of Rhode Island,” nor have all the parties and the trial justice conceded that the State Constitution has specifically placed the “supervision of lotteries in the General Assembly and not in the executive.” The power to regulate is not the power to supervise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_14" id="ref_footnote_2_14">15</a> Nor does it empower the <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>General Assembly to act judicially with respect to interpreting the laws it enacts to regulate lotteries. Surely, it would be ludicrous to suggest that merely because the Federal Constitution grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate commerce” in Article I, section 8, it thereby endowed Congress with the ability to execute the commercial laws it passes or to circumvent the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Federal Constitution by investing a subgroup of legislators with the power to pass commercial rules and regulations and then administer these same laws. Second, nothing in our constitution’s language vesting the General Assembly with the legislative power to regulate and to proscribe lotteries entitles the General Assembly to avoid the separate article 6, section 2, requirement that it obtain “[t]he concurrence of the two houses” before “the enactment of laws” pertaining to lottery regulation. And under R.I. Const, art. 9, sec. 14, “[ejvery bill, resolution, or vote * * * which shall have passed both houses of the general assembly shall be presented to the governor” for his or her approval or veto.</p>

But they did not so provide. And because the text of our constitution gives no indication that these bicameralism and presentment provisions have been superseded, modified, or suspended in the case of lotteries, we should read article 6, section 15, of our State Constitution as requiring the Legislature to comply with the normal and usual requirements for passing legislation whenever it attempts to regulate lotteries. Indeed, the existence of constitutional exceptions to the bicameralism and presentment requirements — for example, the advice and consent provisions of R.I. Const, art. 10, sec. 4, for the confirmation of the Governor’s nominees to state court judgeships — proves that when the framers wished to create exceptions to the generally applicable rules that they laid down for valid legislative actions, they knew how to do so.

Adopted in an era when many had lost confidence in the capacity of (unchecked) legislatures to safeguard liberty and respect law, the constitutional checks of bicameralism and presentment, codified in Article I, Section 7, comprised a key element of the Constitution's scheme to preserve individual liberty. Those requirements serve evident and well-understood purposes, which require only brief mention here. First, by dividing the legislative power between two chambers, bicameralism and presentment make it more difficult for factions to usurp legislative authority, ensuring a diffusion of governmental power and preserving the liberty and security of the governed. In this regard, the division of legislative power into distinct parts effectively operates ‘to balance interest against interest, ambition against ambition, the combinations and spirit of dominion of one body against the like combinations and spirit of another.’ Second, the requirements of [bicameralism and presentment] promote caution - and deliberation; by mandating that each piece of legislation clear an intricate process involving distinct constitutional actors, bicameralism and presentment reduce the incidence of hasty and ill-considered legislation. Third, by relying on multiple, potentially antagonistic constitutional decisionmakers, the legislative process prescribed by [bicameralism and presentment] often produces conflict and friction, enhancing the prospects for a full and open discussion of matters of public import.” John F.
