(“Koppers”), on August 25, 1976, for personal injuries and wrongful death caused by occupational exposures to coke oven emissions. Koppers was the manufacturer of the coke ovens. Koppers filed a third-party complaint against U.S. Steel seeking contribution or indemnity. U.S. Steel then filed preliminary objections to the third-party complaint. The trial court sustained the preliminary objections, and this Court affirmed. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed. Prior to February 5,1975, Pennsylvania case law allowed a third party, who had been sued by an injured employee, to obtain contribution or indemnity from the employer. Effective on February 5, 1975, an amendment to section 303 of the Workers’ Compensation Act provided that an employer is not liable for damages, contribution, or indemnity to a third party. In <em>Koppers, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that because the employee was injured before February 5, 1975, any negligence by Kop-pers would have occurred before that date; therefore, the amendment to section 303 did not apply retroactively, and Koppers was entitled to seek its substantive rights of contribution and indemnity from U.S. Steel. <em>Koppers, </em><a href="/pa/481/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="481 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1747323" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0454-01">392 A.2d at 1382</a>.</p>

In <em>Gok-alp, </em>an employee was injured in a motor vehicle accident before the 1993 amendment to section 1720 of the MVFRL. Before the 1993 amendment, the employer had no right of subrogation. The employee received the proceeds of a third-party settlement after the amendment to section 1720; thus, the employee received her proceeds at a time when the employer had a right of subrogation. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer’s workers’ compensation carrier, and this Court reversed. On further appeal, an evenly divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Bell v.

Further, although neither of the Opinions in <em>Gokalp </em>are precedential because our Supreme Court in that case was equally divided, we take some guidance from the Opinion in support of reversal. In that Opinion, Justice Cappy concluded that the subrogation rights of the employer’s insurance carrier did not vest until the employee received the proceeds of the settlement of her third-party action. If we applied such reasoning to the facts of the present case, in which Wimer settled his third-party liability action on December 12, 1999, PEBTF’s subrogation rights did not arise until at least that date. On that date, PEBTF was not an ERISA-qualified plan, and, therefore, was precluded from subrogation.</p>

I think it is important to note that those issues may arise in other circumstances and still must be considered, at least until there is a definitive ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, hopefully in <em>Scalice.</em>
