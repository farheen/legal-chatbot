Principal argues for a broad reading of the term that extends beyond the sale of its insurance products, such as insurance policies and retirement annuities. It explains that all insurers must invest them assets that have been accumulated by virtue of policyholder premium payments, and these investments are essential to the insurer’s ability to meet its contractual obligations to policyholders. Accordingly, “business of an insurance company” necessarily includes investment activities. The City counters that when Principal was operating two office buildings, it was doing the business of a landlord not of an insurer. Further, it argues that Principal’s payment of the BPT on its realty revenue will not trigger a retaliatory tax in the State of Iowa.

At issue in <em>Executive Life </em>was whether a foreign insurer’s revenue from the sale of annuities in Pennsylvania should be used to calculate its Pennsylvania retaliatory tax. Because annuities are not considered to be a form of insurance in Pennsylvania, Executive Life claimed that its annuity sales were not relevant to its retaliatory tax. This Court disagreed. The purpose of the retaliatory tax is to <a id="p859" href="#p859" data-label="859" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*859</a>level the playing field between insurers facing different taxing statutes from state to state. Because California taxed annuity revenue received by Pennsylvania companies from California annuity contract holders, annuity revenue was properly included in the calculation of Executive Life’s Pennsylvania retaliatory tax.

The difference in tax rates between regulated and non-regulated businesses may be explained by the difference in revenue. Insurers, for example, have vast premium receipts, and to tax those revenues without a cap would result in excessive taxation. Of course, here the BPT was not applied to Principal’s premium receipts. Theoretically, premium revenue of a foreign insurer could be taxable under the 1984 Act if imposition of the BPT would not lead to retaliation; this could happen where the premium tax in the other state was much higher than Pennsylvania’s. In that case, the foreign insurer should be able to claim payment of the BPT as a credit towards its Pennsylvania retaliatory tax.</p>

It contends that the holding concerned a partnership that included an insurance company as partner. The City stipulated for purposes of litigation that the partnership’s payment of the BPT would trigger the New York retaliatory tax. However, the City claims there was no intention to establish precedent on the meaning of "business of an insurance company.” In any case, the City contends that this opinion was not binding on the City in subsequent actions.</p>
