Dr. Linehan stated that during a straight leg lifting test, appellant claimed to have pain when lifting her leg to a thirty degree angle while lying down, but when he performed the same test from a sitting position, he could flex her leg to ninety degrees. From this test, Dr. Linehan concluded that appellant was “dissembling” or “not being straight up with [him].” When appellee’s attorney asked if he thought appellant was “lying,” Dr. Linehan responded “yes.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> He concluded that any problems appellant had with her back and knee were not related to a fall in the Safeway store.</p>

Sometimes she slid down the stairs and pushed herself up them backwards. She also stated that since the accident she needed help with the household duties and shopping. On cross-examination, appellant reiterated that she had difficulty doing housework and going up and down stairs. She elaborated on the ways in which she went up and down stairs, and claimed that when using the stairs, she used a banister. She stated that she had these problems with stairs since the accident and indicated that they continued to the present.

Appellee asserted that the videotape was being offered for impeachment of appellant’s and her daughter’s testimony, and to show that they misrepresented facts that related to the extent of damages. Appellant’s attorney opposed the admission of the evidence, arguing that it was surprise evidence and that appellant was not contending that she was bedridden, only that she had diminished capabilities.

Appellant also alleged that she wanted Dr. Abendschein to counter Dr. Linehan’s statement that he and Dr. Abendschein agreed on certain findings. Dr. Linehan testified only that Dr. Abendschein’s physical findings were "about the same" as his and that Dr. Abendschein’s “diagnosis was the same as [his] and [Dr. Abend-schein] gave her a cortisone shot in the knee.” Initially, we note that these statements were elicited by appellant on cross-examination and appellant made no attempt to clarify what the statements meant, making her claim of error considerably less compelling. Dr. Linehan’s statement that his diagnosis was the same as Dr. Abendschein’s can fairly be interpreted in context to mean his diagnosis of chondrocalcinosis in the knee, since he described the treatment that Dr. Abendschein gave appellant for her knee in the same sentence. This was in fact Dr. Abendschein's diagnosis and thus need not be rebutted. Likewise, Dr. Linehan testified that he, like Dr. Abendschein, found appellant to have tenderness in the knee. Without clarification to the contrary, we cannot assume that these physical findings were not findings that were (as Dr. Linehan testified) "about the same” as Dr. Linehan’s. Lastly, we note that when discussing appellant’s "dissembling,” Dr. Line-han was discussing his own findings and in no way referred to Dr. Abendschein.</p>

Appellant also argued to the trial court and again on appeal that the reason she had not listed Dr. Abendschein as an expert witness on the joint pretrial statement was that Dr. Bentoli-la referred appellant to Dr. Abendschein only after the pretrial statement had been filed. However, it is clear from the record that the trial court allowed amendments of the pretrial statement and that appellant knew how to move for such an amendment. In late July, 1991, albeit before appellee’s motion to limit Dr. Ben-tolila’s testimony, appellant requested and received permission to amend the pretrial statement to include a copy of the bill for Dr. Abend-schein’s services as an exhibit.</p>

This alone belies appellant's broad equitable argument that both the motion concerning Dr. Abendschein and the motion concerning the videotape should have been granted or neither. Dr. Abendschein’s testimony was basically designed to show that Dr. Linehan’s medical conclusions were wrong, while the videotape was introduced to show that appellant’s testimony was false with respect to facts within the personal knowledge of appellant, a direct credibility challenge. The issues were independent and a trial court’s role is to deal with each required ruling on its own merits.</p>

The trial court record indicates, however, that a proffer was made and argument heard by the trial judge, who made a ruling. At the time of the proffer and argument before the trial judge, it was undisputed that the videotapes showed appellant at the relevant place and time. Further, the trial judge specifically stated that he would permit appellant to be recalled after the videotape had been played to the jury, thereby affording appellant an opportunity to mitigate any prejudice as a result of late notice of the videotape.
