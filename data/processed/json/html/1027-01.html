We conclude from the limited record before us that the District Court in granting custody to the father gave undue weight to the fact that the mother as a Jehovah’s Witness would not consent to a blood transfusion for the son. Since the custody decision implicates the constitutionally sensitive areas of religious freedom and familial relationships, we vacate the judgments below and remand the case to the District Court for the purpose of making a custody determination in accordance with the principles here enunciated.</p>

After remarrying and setting up a new home, the father, by a motion filed on October 5, 1978, seeking amendment of the divorce decree, requested custody of the child. At the hearings, one <a id="p1029" href="#p1029" data-label="1029" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1029</a>reason advanced by the father in support of his motion was that the mother would not consent to a blood transfusion for their son.</p>

In his “Findings of Fact and Decision thereon” the District Court judge stated that the mother’s religious practice in regard to blood transfusions raised an “issue of major importance.” On the basis of the mother’s testimony that she would withhold her consent to a blood transfusion for her son even if it became medically necessary to safeguard the child’s health, the court concluded “that the [mother’s] religious beliefs are such that they would endanger the physical well-being or life of their child.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Because of the sensitivity of the constitutional rights involved, however, any such inquiry must proceed along a two-stage analysis designed to protect those rights against unwarranted infringement. To summarize that analysis briefly: first, in order to assure itself that there exists a factual situation necessitating such infringement, the court must make a threshold factual determination that the child’s temporal well-being is immediately and substantially endangered by the religious practice in question and, if that threshold determination is made, second, the court must engage in a deliberate and articulated balancing of the conflicting interests involved, to the end that its custody order makes the least possible infringement upon the parent’s liberty interests consistent with the child’s well-being. In carrying out that two-stage analysis, the trial court should make, on the basis of record evidence, specific findings of fact concerning its evaluation of all relevant considerations bearing upon its ultimate custody order.</p>

The temporary order included in the mandate of this court is subject to modification from time to time by the District Court. Our interim direction that the child not be removed from the state of Maine is made solely to maintain the physical status quo until the District Court has an opportunity to review what custody arrangements are best for the child pending the new hearing. In view of the imminent reassignment of the father to a post distant from Maine, the new hearing should itself be given priority on the schedule of the District Court.</p>

We therefore agree with the mother’s principal contention on appeal, that the first amendment guarantee of religious liberty prohibits the divorce court from taking her religious practices into account in determining custody <em>unless </em>such practices pose an immediate and substantial threat to the temporal well-being of the child. The mother further contends, however, that the mere remote statistical probability that a normal, healthy child may require a blood transfusion at some time in the future is <em>as a matter of law </em>an insufficient reason to impinge upon her religious liberty. Since we have no way of knowing what that statistical probability is, we decline now to rule upon that contention.</p>

We emphasize that the court, when faced with a question of this nature, must never <em>assume </em>that a threat to the child’s welfare exists. Rather, at this threshold stage of the inquiry, the court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the religious practice at issue <em>in fact </em>poses an immediate and substantial risk to the temporal well-being of the child. <em>Compare Levitsky v. Levitsky, supra </em>(mother, a Jehovah’s Witness, had recently refused blood transfusion for child with bleeding ulcer; orders of trial court minimizing risk to child affirmed) <em>with Harris v.

At oral argument, counsel had no recollection of any evidence before the District Court that we view sufficient to justify a finding that the mother’s religious practice posed an immediate and substantial threat to the child. The court’s sole finding concerning the boy’s health indicates that he is a normal and active 8-year-old. We do not know what specific evidence, if any, was available concerning his proneness to accidents or to illnesses requiring blood transfusions. Furthermore, facts such as the statistical frequency of blood transfusions for normal children aged eight and older and the degree of risk involved in taking or refusing blood or chemical substitutes, are not the proper subjects of judicial notice but must be proved by evidence, like any other facts, in the court of first instance. In the absence of any such proof of that threshold factual requirement, there could be no legitimate occasion for the court’s impingement upon the mother’s constitutionally protected liberty interests.</p>
