The plaintiff admits that Mosley did not ever say anything racial or comment about the plaintiffs race. The plaintiff also alleges that when she was on vacation in late December 1997, Mosley, along with two other McDonald’s employees, inputted inventory records on a computer at the Prices Corner store.
