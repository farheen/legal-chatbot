This burden may be satisfied by the certified receipt of an electronic transmission from an insurance company stating that a registrant’s policy has been terminated. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1377(b). This type of evidence, when submitted by the Department, will constitute <em>prima facie </em>proof that the termination by the insurance company was legally effective and that the registrant’s vehicle lacked the required financial re<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>sponsibility coverage. <a href="/a2d/870/0968-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="870 A.2d 968" data-case-ids="9020426" data-case-paths="/a2d/870/0968-01">Id.</a> This presumption may be rebutted by the production of “clear and convincing evidence” that the vehicle was insured at all relevant times. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1786(d)(3)(ii).

If the registrant disputes the validity of an insurance policy cancellation, he must challenge it by requesting review from the Insurance Commissioner.

In <em>Webb, </em>the registrant appealed his suspension, <em>pro se, </em>arguing that he had not received any notice of his insurance policy termination until he received notice of his registration suspension from the Department. The trial court found that the registrant’s insurance termination had not been effected because the insurance company did not give him the advance written notice required by Section 2006 of the Insurance Company Law, 40 P.S. § 991.2006. On appeal, we explained that a trial court does not exceed its scope of review “to the extent that a court reviewing a [Department] registration suspension appeal may certainly examine the record before it to determine whether an insured’s evidence has overcome the applicable presumption established by [the Department.]” <a href="/a2d/870/0968-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="870 A.2d 968" data-case-ids="9020426" data-case-paths="/a2d/870/0968-01">Id. at 974</a>. This Court found that an inquiry into the validity of an insurance policy termination is within the province of the Insurance Commissioner when an examination beyond the record on its face is warranted. However, we also noted that the Department’s own suspension notice does not state specifically that such appeals are to be brought to the Insurance Commissioner, which makes it understandable that the registrant would bring such an issue to the trial court hearing the suspension appeal. We concluded that in such circumstances it is appropriate to allow the registrant to seek <em>nunc pro tunc </em>review of his insurance policy cancellation from the Insurance Commissioner.</p>

Trial court opinion at 2, R.R. 54a. The trial court noted in its opinion that the Department did not question Mrs. Dinsmore about this letter.

Presently, the Department contends that the trial court erred by holding that the March 29 letter created a three-week grace period.
