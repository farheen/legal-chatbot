Naja’s mother, Linda Green, gave birth to Naja on August 4,1990 at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia; the child was premature, weighing less than three pounds at birth and testing positive for cocaine in her system, hepatitis and syphilis. The mother, an admitted drug abuser, abandoned the child in the hospital. The mother had identified McCoy to hospital personnel as Naja’s “father,” but did not list anyone as father on the child’s birth certificate. McCoy had been incarcerated at the time of conception, and was aware that he was not Green’s sole intimate partner; he insisted, nonetheless, that he was intimately involved with Naja’s mother while out on a furlough and that he was Naja’s father.</p>

During this time, he visited Naja at the hospital, but his circumstances prevented him from providing financially for Naja. On August 24, 1990, DHS held a conference with McCoy and McCoy’s mother; McCoy’s mother questioned her son’s paternity also, but indicated that she would care for the child. Later, however, she stated she was unable to care for Naja.</p>

On October 17, 1990, McCoy signed a voluntary placement agreement and was granted weekly visits with Naja. Naja has lived with her foster parents since she was two months old; the foster parents wish to adopt Naja should she become free for adoption. McCoy was reincarcerated on December 18, 1990 due to a parole violation.</p>

On December 22,1992, McCoy’s visits were vacated and McCoy was precluded from contacting Naja except through an attorney.</p>

    <p id="b1132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1132.6",1132,[185,1131,758,901]]]'>McCoy argues that DHS, as a result of its acceptance of McCoy as Naja’s father for the first twenty-one months of the child’s life, is estopped from challenging paternity. DHS argues that the doctrine of paternity by estoppel has never been applied to dependent children. DHS contends that matters involving dependent children are governed by the Juvenile Act, which mandates that the court consider the child’s best interests above all else. In the alternative, DHS argues that if this court finds that domestic relations law is applicable, then the trial court correctly determined that McCoy had failed to establish the elements of paternity by estoppel. Specifically, DHS contends that McCoy failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that his actions or DHS’s actions should estop DHS from requesting a paternity test.</p>

Although we applaud McCoy’s efforts at parenting, our review of the record precludes us from characterizing McCoy’s relationsMp to Naja as “parental.” None of the determining factors for patermty, as codified in 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5102(b) apply. The parents did not marry, and there was no determination of patermty. Further, McCoy was unemployed, unable to provide housing, care, or financial support for Naja, and was serving a prison sentence. 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 5102(b)(1), (2), and (3). Realistically, McCoy was unable to establish or maintain a parent/child relationsMp with Naja. TMs is particularly emphasized here due to Naja’s special developmental needs caused by her medical condition at birth. These facts do not rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence to support a determination of patermty. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5102(b)(2); <em>see also Jefferson v.
