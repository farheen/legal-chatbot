Plaintiff allegedly fell on December 22, 1999 down the Building A stairs maintained by Defendant. At issue is whether Defendant was negligent in maintaining the stairs and, if so, whether such negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiffs injuries. Plaintiff alleges that the stairs were icy at the time, while Defendant maintains that there was no snow or ice on the stairs.</p>

      <em>Discussion</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[114,775,751,611]]]'>The first set of photographs depicts stairs at the location of the alleged slip and fall five weeks after the alleged incident and the second set depicts stairs at that location as well as another location in the complex over three years after that incident. The proposed testimony of Mark Mervine deals directly with those photographs and the conditions when they were taken. Since this occurred well after the alleged incident, then it should be considered as proof of a subsequent bad act.</p>
    <p id="b461-7" data-blocks='[["BL_461.7",461,[113,1412,752,656]]]'>The Court cannot project any way that any of this proposed evidence fits into one of the exceptions under Rule 404(b). Furthermore, it seems to the Court that any probative value that this evidence may have would be substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice as well as misleading the jury because it does not show the conditions of the actual location of the alleged slip and fall at the time it occurred. Rather, it shows conditions at that location (as well as another location) at a time much later.</p>
    <p id="b461-8" data-blocks='[["BL_461.8",461,[113,2103,750,91]]]'>Considering this proposed evidence in terms of the balancing test:</p>
    <p id="b461-9" data-blocks='[["BL_461.9",461,[112,2222,751,299]],["BL_461.10",461,[912,291,753,241]]]'>(1) The proposed evidence does not appear to be material to an issue or ultimate fact in the present case. The proposed evidence and testimony deals with the conditions of the location (and a different location in the second set of photographs) five weeks and three years later, respectively. It does not deal with the conditions of the stairs at the actual time of the incident nor even in close proximity to the time of the incident.</p>
    <p id="b461-14" data-blocks='[["BL_461.13",461,[912,580,756,968]]]'>(2) D.R.E. 404(b) provides that “evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident.” It appears that the photographs and proposed testimony are being offered to show that Defendant did not clear ice and snow from the steps at the time the photos were taken, so Defendant must have failed to do so at the time of the incident as well. This is an impermissible purpose. Furthermore, the proposed evidence and testimony does not fall squarely within one of the exceptions listed.</p>
    <p id="b461-15" data-blocks='[["BL_461.14",461,[911,1596,754,352]]]'>(3) The photographs could very well be “plain, clear and conclusive” evidence of the condition of the stairs at a time other than the incident at issue here. That fact alone would not be justification to admit the photographs and testimony, as it is still prejudicial and likely to cause confusion.</p>
    <p id="b461-16" data-blocks='[["BL_461.15",461,[910,1988,755,350]]]'>(4) For purposes of determining the conditions of the stairs at the time of the alleged slip and fall (snow and/or ice) of December 22, 1999, the photographs (and related proposed testimony) would be too remote in time, being taken five weeks and three years after, respectively.</p>

    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[203,417,756,806]]]'>Plaintiff argues that the proposed admission of the photographs and the testimony of Mr. Mervine would <em>serve to </em>impeach Defendant’s witness, Zannis Bousses, who is the manager and president of the Board of Directors of Brandy-wine. He has testified, and is expected to testify in the future, that Brandywine always takes care of removing ice and snow on the steps before 7:00 a.m. Plaintiff seeks to show the photographs to the jury and have Mr. Mervine testify to show that this is not the case and to reflect on the credibility and trustworthiness of its witnesses as well as Mr. Bousses. However, D.R.E. 608(b) provides as follows:</p>

      <em>Specific instances of conduct. </em>Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other than conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609 [Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime], may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness’ character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.</blockquote>

    <p id="b462-9" data-blocks='[["BL_462.10",462,[1003,866,751,610]]]'>The proposed testimony and photographs are not sufficiently relevant to justify their admission.
