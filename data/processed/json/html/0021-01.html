The property is unimproved except for a single family residence. Property Owners wish to develop the property, but they encountered difficulty dealing with Adams and Cranberry Townships because of the municipalities’ dispute over jurisdiction. As a result, Property Owners filed a petition for the appointment of a border commission to determine the exact location of the boundary on the subject property pursuant to Section 302 of the Second Class Township Code (Code).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court granted Property Owners’ request.

At these hearings, the boundary’s history was traced. In 1853, the trial court appointed a board of viewers to divide Butler County into townships of approximately five miles square each. The board of viewers submitted a report and draft which was accepted by the trial court in 1854 (1854 acceptance order). As recommended by the board of viewers, Butler County was divided into 33 townships.</p>

Thus, the Border Commission was left to extrapolate the location of the boundary from circumstantial evidence. The parties presented various theories about the boundary’s location and offered three professional engineers’ opinions.</p>

He opined the boundary could be located using a technique that employed mathematical division to interpret the 1853 division order. Specifically, Adams’ Township’s Engineer located the boundary by (i) determining the southeast and southwest corners of the county, (ii) measuring the distance between the two points using GPS technology,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and then (in) dividing that distance into five equal townships.

The map showed the entire county and contained a rendering of the various township boundaries.
