Commw. 358" data-case-ids="1378475" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/120/0358-01">548 A.2d 1284</a> (1988), which involved the plaintiff who was injured when his car strayed from the paved portion of the highway, entered an earthen drainage ditch after steering to the right to avoid a deer, struck and jumped a drainage culvert, crossed a driveway and then sideswiped the utility pole located eight feet from the paved portion from the highway. This Court affirmed the trial court’s grant of a summary judgment in favor of the Bell Telephone Company, concluding that Bell’s duty not to incommode or unreasonably interfere with public use of highways does not extend to vehicles which completely leave the highway out of control due to extraordinary occurrences and that the injuries were not proximately caused by the proximity of the pole to the highway.</p>
    <p id="b1254-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1254.8",1254,[983,823,754,707]]]'>More recently, this court has affirmed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of a telephone company in <em>Novak v. Kilby, </em>— Pa.Commonwealth Ct. -, <a href="/pa-commw/167/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="647 A.2d 687" data-case-ids="1466748,7867998" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/167/0217-01,/a2d/647/0687-01">647 A.2d 687</a> (1994), which involved a sixteen-year old minor who lost control of his ear, crossed the road, and crashed into a wooden post, a cable guardrail and then a telephone pole located five and one-half feet from the edge of the pavement. Before the accident, the minor consumed a can of beer at a party. This Court concluded that the causal connection between the location of the pole and the injury was too remote for the utility company’s liability to attach.</p>
    <p id="b1254-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1254.9",1254,[981,1552,754,796]]]'>We do not find, however, that the <em>Caldwell </em>and <em>Novak </em>holdings support the trial court’s grant of nonsuit in this matter. <em>Caldwell </em>was decided based upon the unique facts involving a series of “extraordinary” events, which led to the Court’s conclusion that Bell was entitled to a summary judgment. As the Court noted in <em>Caldwell, </em>the record did not support alleged previous similar accidents in the area, as in <em>Nelson. </em>In <em>Novak, </em>the record established that the pole had existed without any accident for nearly fifty years. By contrast, the Talaricos presented the evidence of PP &amp; L’s awareness of previous similar incidents in the area before its installation of the pole and the availability of less dangerous alternative locations.</p>
    <p id="b1254-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1254.10",1254,[978,2377,754,372]],["BL_1255.1",1255,[188,213,754,176]]]'>The evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Talaricos, is clear that the jury could reasonably have found that PP &amp; L was negligent and that its negligence was a substantial cause of the injuries. Hence, the trial court invaded the province of the jury in taking the case from its determination. Accordingly, the order of the trial <a id="p1197" href="#p1197" data-label="1197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1197</a>court granting a nonsuit in favor of PP &amp; L is reversed and the nonsuit removed. This matter is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>
