    <blockquote id="b780-13" data-blocks='[["BL_780.14",780,[244,1045,1318,782]]]'>Claim 8 relates to the means for balancing the vessel as disclosed in Figure 51 of the drawing. The examiner has relied primarily on the patent to Adam et al. and in the brief the feature upon which appellant relies to distinguish over the balancing device of Adam et al. is the manner in which the fluid in the control tube is effective. In appellant’s construction the fluid in tube 204 moves a float at the end of the tube for controlling a rheostat. The apparatus pumps the balancing fluid from one tank to the other. The liquid in the control tube of Adam merely makes contact at the ends of the tube for energizing the motor to drive in one direction or the other. Appellant points out that claim 8 calls for change in pressure of the fluid against the walls of the container. He states that this refers to the pressure against the float and that inasmuch as the tube of Adam has no float this claim does not read upon the structure of Adam. We do not consider that there is any patentable distinction in controlling a motor current from the differences in liquid level rather than from a float moved by the differences in position of the liquid. We regard one as the mechanical equivalent of the other. We have noted appellant’s contention that the motor of Adam would be apt to overrun but in our opinion there would be no difficulty in providing a proper control for the motor so as to prevent this action if it is found objectionable.</blockquote>

The Patent Office tribunals clearly erred in this respect, but the solicitor contends that, conceding that claim 8 relates to the means for stabilizing a vessel as disclosed in Figures 54-59 of the drawings, it still is disclosed by the Adam specification. He further contends that the phrase in said claim, reading “ said actuating means being responsive to the change in pressure of the fluid against walls of its container,” can not be considered as a structural difference over the reference Adam because, he contends, the phrase quoted is only a statement of how appellants’ device works, rather <a id="p1463" href="#p1463" data-label="1463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1463</a>titan a statement of any particular structure. We do not agree with, this contention; while the means and the pressure produce a function, it is, we think, structure that is de’scribed and not the function produced by the structure.</p>

    <p id="b781-6" data-blocks='[["BL_781.6",781,[80,845,1316,99]]]'>We are of the opinion that the phrase in claim 8 above quoted may be properly considered as an element of the claim.</p>
    <p id="b781-7" data-blocks='[["BL_781.7",781,[77,947,1321,648]]]'>The patent to Adam shows a mercury level, being a glass tube with upturned ends, containing mercury; this level tilts with the ship. When the ship is out of horizontal position, the mercury flows in the direction below the horizontal, coming in contact with a terminal, thereby starting a motor at full speed to change the position of the weights which are provided. The opening or closing of the contact is not dependent upon a change in the pressure of a fluid against the walls of its container, as specified in claim 8 of appellants’ application, nor does the device contemplate or provide any arrangement for regulating the speed with which the weights may be shifted. The consequence is that Adam’s device may result in causing a tilting in the opposite direction and make it difficult for the ship to speedily regain its equilibrium.</p>
    <p id="b781-8" data-blocks='[["BL_781.8",781,[75,1602,1327,848]],["BL_782.1",782,[248,242,1322,794]]]'>The device covered by claim 8 works upon an altogether different principle. It applies the principle of hydrostatic head, and provides for controller actuating means containing a liquid which has a substantial hydrostatic head or pressure against the walls in the ■container. There is a tank located in the forward part of the ship, in an elevated position; said tank is connected by a tube with a •cylinder, located toward the rear of said ship and at a lower elevation with respect to the aforementioned tank; within this cylinder is a piston, one face of which is toward the inlet of the tube and forms one of the walls of the cylinder container, while on the other side of the piston a spring is interposed. Into the tank and tube system above set forth is placed a fluid, with the result that there is a hydrostatic pressure exerted upon one face of the piston in the •cylinder. The position of the piston within the cylinder depends upon the relative hydrostatic pressure on one side of the piston and the pressure exerted by the spring on the other side. When the level of the tank is raised, as by the nose of the ship tipping upward, <a id="p1464" href="#p1464" data-label="1464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1464</a>the hydrostatic head of the system increases and the piston in the cylinder responds to said increase of pressure by moving within the cylinder and compressing the spring. This movement of the piston is transmitted, by means unnecessary here to detail, to a rheostat, causing the same to energize a corrective motor, the speed at which said motor will run depending upon the position of the rheostat, which in turn depends upon the extent of movement of the piston in the cylinder. In other words, the rapidity of operation of the corrective motor is proportionate to the degree of tipping of the ship, or, to state it another way, is responsive to the degree of change of hydrostatic pressure, so that it will run slowly if the deviation of the ship’s bow be slight, and rapidly if the deviation be great. The reverse is true in case the bow is depressed, the hydrostatic pressure in this case being decreased, allowing the spring in the cylinder to move the piston in the opposite direction, resulting in the operation of the motor in the reverse direction.</p>
    <p id="b782-4" data-blocks='[["BL_782.4",782,[248,1044,1320,434]]]'>Mere contact of the liquid with the piston and walls of the cylinder accomplishes nothing. The action of the device is dependent wholly upon hydrostatic pressure. In the Adam device, mere contact of the mercury with the terminal starts the motor and, as heretofore observed, at a constant speed, while in applicants’ device the speed of the motor is dependent upon the degree of pressure of the liquid upon the walls of the container. We are clear that the Adam patent is not a proper reference for claim 8, and that said claim should be allowed.</p>
