Eight hearings were conducted before the Fay-ette County Zoning Hearing Board (Board). At its last hearing on October 23, 1996, the Board orally announced its approval of Amerikohl’s application, with several conditions. The Board thereafter failed to issue a written decision within 45 days of the last hearing as is required by Section 908(9) of the Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L, 805, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 10908(9).</p>

On February 4, 1999 Amerikohl filed a petition to intervene which the trial court granted. On April 12, 1999, Ameri-kohl filed a motion to quash MPA’s November 21, 1996 appeal which the trial court granted finding that there was no written decision from the Board at the time MPA filed its November 21, 1996 appeal. Athough MPA could have chosen to pursue a statutory appeal of the deemed approval, it faded to do so. As such, the trial court determined that it was without jurisdiction to hear MPA’s appeal. This appeal followed.</p>

As such, Amerikohl filed a mandamus action. MPA concedes that the decision of the trial court issuing a writ of mandamus in favor of Amerikohl on March 14, 1997, granting its special exception without conditions was a final ruling. (MPA’s brief at p. 8.) In accordance with 53 P.S. § 11002-A in the case of a deemed decision, an appeal must be filed within “30 days after the date upon’which notice of said deemed decision is given.... ” MPA maintains that because it filed an appeal of the Board’s oral decision granting the special exception with conditions on November 21, 1996, less then 30 days after the rendering of the oral decision, this appeal is sufficient to act as an appeal of the trial court order of March 14, 1997 granting deemed approval of Amerikohl’s special exception without conditions. MPA maintains that it did not file a late appeal but an early one and should not be denied its opportunity to be heard on the merits. We disagree.</p>

Thus, the November 21 appeal was premature and did not fall within the 30 day appeal period provided for by 53 P.S. § 11002-A. Amerikohl maintains that a court lacks jurisdiction to hear a premature appeal just as it lacks jurisdiction to hear a late appeal. <em>Galbreath v.

The developer also initiated a mandamus action to compel issuance of the requested permits, as the Board’s decision was not issued within 45 days. This court agreed with developer that the Board’s decision, having been recorded beyond the 45 day limit was deemed favorable to applicant. The developer sought to discontinue his precautionary appeal from the Board’s seemingly adverse ruling, but objectors sought to press developer’s precautionary appeal to obtain further review on the merits. This court stated that the decision in the mandamus action held as a matter of law that the Board’s failure to render a decision within 45 days constituted a favorable decision for the developer. Hence, developer was not aggrieved by the decision of the Board and had no standing to initiate the precautionary appeal. Objectors were trying to breathe life into a moot appeal. Here, Amerikohl argues that MPA’s premature appeal is a nullity; and we agree.</p>

This is also not a case where MPA appealed an adjudication awaiting docketing. Rather, MPA filed an appeal before the Board reached a decision. Moreover, we also observe that the deemed decision which granted Amerikohl an <em>unconditional </em>permit could not as MPA argues have perfected MPA’s prior appeal of the Board’s oral decision to grant the permit as that grant by the Board was for a <em>conditional </em>permit. As the appeal of a conditional permit is not the same as an appeal of a unconditional permit, one could not perfect the other.</p>

A representative of Amerikohl, counsel for Amerikohl, ¿is well as members of the press were in attendance. The following day, a newspaper of general circulation reported the Board’s decision.</p>

On December 2, 1996, the proposed decision was submitted to the Fayette County Office of Planning and Community Development (Planning Office). Pursuant to internal operating procedures, the Planning Office mailed the decision to Board Chair, Ross DiMarco, for his execution and return. DiMarco signed and dated the decision and hand delivered it to the Planning Office during the first week of December 1996. However, the decision was lost and never mailed to Amerikohl or any other party of record.

And now the majority holds in the current matter before this Court that MPA’s appeal of the Board’s decision must be quashed because MPA’s November 21, 1996 appeal of the Board’s oral decision was premature because it was filed before the entry of a final order. Accordingly, this Court affirms the trial court’s order quashing MPA’s appeal from the Board’s oral decision and holds that since MPA did not file a timely appeal from the deemed approval of Amerikohl’s application for special exception, the merits of MPA’s appeal are not properly before this Court.</p>
