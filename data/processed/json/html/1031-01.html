Budget further contends that Green is not entitled to further PIP benefits from Budget because he has already received first party PIP benefits from his personal automobile insurance policy with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

Monroe, a Delaware resident, who was driving a rental car that was owned by Budget, a Delaware corporation. The rental car had been rented from Budget by Frazier, also a Delaware resident, who had obtained the car from Budget’s rental agency in Wilmington. The rental car was registered in Pennsylvania and-was self-insured by Budget pursuant to a Self-Insurer Certificate issued to Budget by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.</p>
    <p id="b1062-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1062.14",1062,[980,1182,754,1047]]]'>Green made a claim against his personal insurance carrier, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance . Company (“State Farm”), for PIP benefits. State Farm tendered the PIP policy limit of $50,000. Green requested that Budget pay the remainder of his medical bills, which Budget declined to pay. Green then filed a complaint seeking- a declaration 1) that this Court declare that Delaware law applies to his PIP claim against Budget instead of Pennsylvania law, 2) that Green is entitled to PIP benefits under Budget’s self insured policy pursuant to 21 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2118 and 3) that Delaware law permits Green to stack PIP benefits. Apparently, under Pennsylvania law, Green would be barred from any further recovery of PIP benefits because the applicable Pennsylvania law, 75 <em>Pa.C.S.A </em>§ 1713, does not permit “stacking” of PIP benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <em>Nationwide Insurance Co. v. Battaglia, </em>the Delaware Supreme Court held that “entitlement to no-fault benefits is set forth in the sections’s eligibility provisions ...

The vehicle’s owner had insurance coverage through Nationwide, which provided for the minimum PIP coverage permitted under Maryland law. The plaintiff incurred damages in excess of that minimum PIP coverage and sought the additional expenses from Nationwide under the theory that Delaware law required a higher amount for minimum PIP coverage. The Court held that § 2118 “cannot be held to impose Delaware’s minimum PIP insurance benefits requirement on the defendant” because the Maryland statute was the applicable law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

However, 21 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 2102(b) permits vehicles to be operated in Delaware as long as the “owner has insurance on such motor vehicle equal to the minimum insurance required by the state or jurisdiction where said vehicle is registered.” Because the legislature has designated insurance requirements for out of state vehicles to operate in Delaware but has not required registration in Delaware of out of state rental cars, this Court will not read such a requirement into the statute.</p>

Budget argues alternatively that if the Court were to hold that stacking of PIP benefits was controlled by Delaware law that the language of the rental agreement would preclude stacking of PIP benefits. Budget contends that “the exclusions to Budget’s Financial responsibility Protection ... [in] [t]he language of [its] rental agreement essentially shifts the primary responsibility for PIP benefits to any other available source.” The terms of the rental agreement at section 5 provide, in part that "BUDGET’S PROTECTION DOES NOT APPLY until after exhaustion of all insurance and/or other protection available to the driver of the Vehicle and/or any injured passenger in the Vehicle.” Def’s Op.

Green has also argued that Pennsylvania law should not apply in the instant case because Budget was not covered by a specific insurance policy, but rather has simply supplied evidence satisfactory to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that it has the resources to provide insurance benefits required by Pennsylvania law. Green frames his argument as a choice of law argument and not a contract question based upon an insurance policy. Green argues that "Delaware law applies to defendant’s financial obligations to plaintiff because Delaware is the state with the most significant relationship to the claim.” Pi’s Reply at ¶ 4.
