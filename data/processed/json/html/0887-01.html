Cannon was convicted in 1969 of two counts of robbery and one count of assault with intent to commit rape. He received an aggregate sentence of fifteen to forty-five years’ imprisonment. In June of 1999, Cannon’s parole officer A. Igbor-zurkie notified him that he was required to register as a sex offender under the District’s sex offender registration law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Cannon thereupon filed a habeas corpus action in Superior Court, in which he contended that the registration law did not apply to him because he was seventeen years of age and hence a juvenile when he committed his registration offense. Opposing Cannon’s petition, the District of Columbia argued that Cannon was subject to the statutory registration requirement because the Juvenile Court had waived jurisdiction in his case and he was lawfully prosecuted and convicted as an adult. The Superior Court sided with the District, denied habe-as corpus relief and dismissed Cannon’s petition. We now affirm that ruling on Cannon’s appeal.</p>

Cannon asks us to hold that retroactive application of the sex offender registration law to persons who, like him, committed their crimes before the law was enacted, would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. <em>See </em>U.S. Const., art. I, § 10, cl. 1. We decline to address this contention. “Questions not properly raised and preserved during the proceedings under examination, and points not asserted with sufficient precision to indicate distinctly the party’s thesis, will normally be spurned on appeal.” <em>D.D. v.

We see no good reason to make an exception to this general rule for Cannon’s constitutional claims in this case. The merits of those claims turn on whether the registration and notification provisions of the law are criminal or civil in purpose or effect,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> an inquiry that might have benefitted from the development of a record in the trial court.</p>

According to <em>the </em>District, the “dispute resolution procedures” set forth in the Act required Cannon to await a formal determination by the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) as to whether he was required to register as a sex offender. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-4004. Upon receiving such a determination, <em>Cannon </em>would have been entitled to notify the agency of his intention to seek review,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and then to file a motion in Superior Court. Unless the court found that the motion conclusively showed that Cannon was not entitled to relief, it would call for a response from the “prosecuting attorney,” i.e., the United States Attorney (rather than the District of Columbia). <em>See <a href="/f2d/384/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 F.2d 319" data-case-ids="2082277,4067961" data-case-paths="/f2d/384/0319-01">id.</a></em>

Broglin, </em><a href="/f2d/922/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="922 F.2d 379" data-case-ids="10542701" data-case-paths="/f2d/922/0379-01">922 F.2d 379</a>, 381-82 (7th Cir.1991) (Posner, J.) (“the mislabeling should simply be ignored”). Thus the issue that the District raises is not lack of jurisdiction over Cannon’s claim, but rather a failure by Cannon to exhaust administrative remedies by applying to the CSOSA before he went to court. It is true that Cannon did not exhaust potential remedies with the CSO-SA. But exhaustion requirements are not jurisdictional and may be waived. <em>See Barnett v. District of Columbia Dep’t of Employment Servs., </em><a href="/a2d/491/1156-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="491 A.2d 1156" data-case-ids="7935061" data-case-paths="/a2d/491/1156-01">491 A.2d 1156</a>, 1160—61 (D.C.1985) (exhaustion requirements are “rules of judicial administration”). The District chose to oppose Cannon’s ha-beas petition on the merits without raising the exhaustion defense. The United States Attorney, who appeared in the proceeding as she would have pursuant to Section 22-4004 of the Act if Cannon had moved for review of a prior CSOSA determination, likewise did not invoke the exhaustion doctrine. Instead, she joined in the District’s opposition on the merits. Furthermore, it is not suggested that the CSOSA was vested with any discretion to waive statutory registration requirements in Cannon’s case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> No party was prejudiced by Cannon’s habeas petition, and the record before the Superior Court was not deficient for purposes of addressing his claim. A remand to allow Cannon’s case to proceed anew as a motion to review a CSOSA determination would serve no purpose that we can see. In the final analysis, Cannon’s action was functionally equivalent to the application for judicial review contemplated by the Act. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-4004. We hold that any objection that Cannon failed to exhaust administrative remedies has been waived.</p>
