    <p id="b948-18" data-blocks='[["BL_948.18",948,[986,808,755,1338]]]'>On August 27, 1998, the District filed petitions alleging that D.W. and M.W., thirteen and ten year old boys, respectively, were neglected children in that each was “in imminent danger of being abused by his guardians, and said child’s cousin, who was also under the care of said child’s guardians, [had] been abused.” The guardians, L.B. and T.B., were alleged to have been the caregivers of D.W. since the child was five, and of M.W. since he was approximately a month old. They were similarly alleged to have had custody of the cousin, S.T., until November 11, 1997, when she was brought to the hospital where she died of injuries, at the age of two. According to the petitions, the District of Columbia Medical Examiner had determined that “the injuries were nonac-cidental, and ... that [S.T.’s] death was a homicide.” The District of Columbia sought an adjudication that D.W. and M.W. were neglected children under D.C.Code § 16-2301(9)(E), which defines a “neglected child” to include a child “who is in imminent danger of being abused and whose sibling has been abused.”</p>

It requested an in limine ruling by the court that S.T. was a “sibling” of D.W. and M.W. because she was their cousin and had “lived in the same home as [they did] in the full time care of [L.B. and T.B.] from September to November 11, 1997.” The <a id="p915" href="#p915" data-label="915" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*915</a>District contended that “related children living in the same home under the full time care of the same care providers constitute siblings under the common meaning of [§ ] 16-2301(9)(E).” The Superior Court rejected this interpretation of the statute and dismissed the petitions, concluding that D.W. and M.W. “do not constitute 'siblings’ of the deceased minor, [S.T.], under D.C.Code § 16-2301 [ (9) ](E).”</p>

    <p id="b949-10" data-blocks='[["BL_949.9",949,[956,701,757,1717]]]'>"When interpreting the language of a statute, “this court examines the plain meaning of the language used and, ‘absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.’ ” <em>In re G.G., </em><a href="/a2d/667/1331-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="667 A.2d 1331" data-case-ids="7876586" data-case-paths="/a2d/667/1331-01">667 A.2d 1331</a>, 1334 (D.C.1995) (citations omitted). The District’s initial argument that the term “sibling” has no plain meaning in ordinary usage is unconvincing. The common understanding of the word, reflected in nearly all dictionary definitions, is of a brother or sister, <em>i.e., </em>“one of two or more persons born of the same parents or ... sometimes having one parent in common.” Webster’s New World College DICTIONARY 1331 (4th ed.1999). <em>See also, e.g., </em>Webster’s Third New INTERNATIONAL Dictionary 2110 (3rd ed.1986); The AmeriCAN Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1675 (3rd ed.1992). Thus, if instead of employing the word “sibling,” section 16 — 2301(9)(E) had said “brother or sister,” the District would not plausibly be able to argue that the terms include the class of any children living together permanently with the same caregivers, without further limitation. That would stretch the meaning of brother or sister beyond recognition. The District has not persuaded us that by using the word “sibling” the legislature meant to convey more than the normal understanding of that word.</p>

      <a id="p916" href="#p916" data-label="916" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*916</a>The District fixes upon the term “parent” used by dictionaries in defining “sibling” <em>(i.e., </em>persons having “one or both parents in common”) and points to that term’s dictionary definition as including, broadly, a “guardian” and/or a “protector,” not just a biological parent. <em>See, e.g., </em>Webster’s II New College Dictionary 798 (1995). But it is illogical to suppose that when a dictionary defines term A by reference to term B (and other terms), it necessarily incorporates all of B’s definitions, even the broadest. The fact that “parent,” in life and the law, may connote more than a biological or adoptive relationship<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> tells us nothing about the customary meaning of “sibling.” More significant, in any case, is the way the terms are used in the neglect statute itself. In keeping with its protective purpose, the statute draws no distinction between “parent,” “guardian,” or “other custodian” in specifying the persons who may be charged with neglecting a child, so as to require state intervention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <em>See </em>§ 16-2301(9) (;passim). Even with respect to “abused” children, as we have seen, the class is defined liberally to include a child not himself or herself abused but in “imminent danger” of such treatment “and whose sibling has been abused.” If the legislature meant “sibling” to be read broadly — to include any child residing permanently with the same custodian — one would expect it to have made that explicit just as it did in equating “parent” with “custodian” (and, to a lesser extent, abused child with child in imminent danger of abuse). It did not. The implication is that, as elsewhere in the District of Columbia Code, the legislature did not intend “sibling” to extend as far as the District would have it do. <em>See, e.g., </em>D.C.Code §§ 22-4101(10)(A) &amp; -4120(a)(2) (1996) (permitting enhanced punishment for crimes of sexual abuse where the victim was under 18 years old and the defendant “had a significant relationship to the victim,” and defining “significant relationship” to include “[a] parent, <em>sibling, </em>aunt, uncle, or grandparent, <em>whether related by blood, marriage, or adoption” </em>(emphasis added)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b950-12" data-blocks='[["BL_950.13",950,[997,1069,753,940]]]'>The District cites no legislative history supporting its broad interpretation, nor have we found any. Although the neglect statute is remedial and thus to be “liberally construed to achieve that end,” <em>In re T.W., </em><a href="/a2d/732/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="732 A.2d 254" data-case-ids="11547191" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/0254-01">732 A.2d 254</a>, 258 (D.C.1999), that principle does not allow us to engraft a definition on the statutory term inconsistent with its ordinary meaning and dictated by nothing in the statute or its genesis. Indeed, since abuse of a sibling under § 16-2301(9)(E) stands as something of a proxy for actual abuse of the child allegedly neglected (as well as providing critical proof of the “imminent danger” of abuse to that child), it is natural to assume that the legislature meant the relationship between these children to be just as close as “sibling” normally denotes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
