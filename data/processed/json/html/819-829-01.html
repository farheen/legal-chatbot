    <p id="b863-16" data-blocks='[["BL_863.16",863,[957,574,754,1383]]]'>The following facts essentially are undisputed. In the early hours of February 14, 2000, Newport police officer, Sergeant Richard Field (Sgt. Field) obeyed a direction by his superior officer, Lieutenant Turano, to respond to a roll-over accident that had just occurred near the toll booths on the Jamestown side of the Newport Bridge. Sergeant Field promptly responded and arrived at the scene simultaneously with the State Police. Upon arrival, Sgt. Field immediately observed a scene of absolute chaos. There were police and rescue vehicle units present from both Jamestown and Newport, all of which had their emergency lights activated. The accident had completely blocked off the eastbound traffic from Jamestown and, because the toll booth operators had not stopped the flow of traffic onto the bridge from Jamestown, the eastbound lanes had backed up and were at a complete standstill between the toll booths and the accident scene. Even the Jamestown police cruisers were blocked in by the traffic and were prevented from gaining vehicular access to the accident scene.</p>
    <p id="b863-17" data-blocks='[["BL_863.17",863,[957,1996,755,560]],["BL_864.1",864,[210,237,754,806]]]'>Sergeant Field approached State Police Trooper Paul Conlon who informed him that the state police would manage the accident scene itself. Sergeant Field then met with Sergeant Donovan (Sgt. Donovan) of the Jamestown police and offered his assistance. They discussed the gravity of the situation and acknowledged that because the circumstances involved a rollover, gasoline would leak onto the bridge thereby creating a very hazardous situa<a id="p832" href="#p832" data-label="832" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*832</a>tion. To avoid a potential catastrophe, it was crucial to evacuate all the vehicles trapped between the toll booths and the accident scene as quickly as possible. They decided that the most efficient way of easing the gridlock and securing the safety of all those present would be to establish a roadblock further up the bridge on the westbound side, and then to direct eastbound traffic to bypass the accident using the so'on-to-be-traffic-free westbound side of the bridge. The only police cruiser available to implement this evacuation plan belonged to Sgt. Field, so he told Sgt. Donovan that he would set up the necessary roadblock.</p>
    <p id="b864-4" data-blocks='[["BL_864.4",864,[204,1068,757,1063]]]'>At approximately 2 a.m., Sgt. Field set up the planned roadblock by positioning his police cruiser at a right angle to the guard rail on the westbound side of the bridge-at a location above the scene of the accident. His vehicle blocked most of the inside lane and partially blocked the outside lane. In addition to the vehicle’s flashing overhead lights, Sgt. Field also used a flashlight to warn all westbound approaching vehicles to stop. Sergeant Field maintained' constant radio contact with Lieutenant Kliever (Lt. Kliever), also a Newport police officer (who had come to the bridge), in order to apprise Sgt. Donovan and Lt. Kliever of the status and safety of the operation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The entire evacuation procedure took approximately fifteen minutes during which time only two vehicles approached from the westbound side of the bridge.</p>

However, instead of stopping, the second vehicle, which was driven by defendant, appeared to gain speed as it swerved from the inside lane into the outside lane. The vehicle sped by Sgt. Field at approximately fifty miles per hour. Sergeant Field testified that defendant passed between the cruiser and the curb through “a very tight space” and that defendant’s vehicle “jolted sharply!,]” appearing as if it may have actually struck the curb. Considering the speed of the vehicle, the time of day, defendant’s failure to obey a command to stop at an emergency roadblock, his erratic driving and his apparent failure to see the numerous emergency flashing lights ahead, Sgt. Field suspected that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. He immediately radioed ahead to warn Lt. Kliever of his suspicions and of the fact that defendant had failed to obey his command.</p>
    <p id="b864-8" data-blocks='[["BL_864.9",864,[1008,1091,751,818]]]'>Lieutenant Kliever stopped defendant’s vehicle near the toll booths and examined him for suspicion of driving under the influence. After he subjected defendant to various field sobriety tests, Lt. Kliever turned defendant over to the State Police officers who charged him with driving under the influence and brought him to the State Police barracks in Portsmouth. At the State Police barracks, defendant submitted to a breathalyzer test. The reading from the first test indicated that defendant had a blood alcohol level of 0.176. By the time the second test was administered, his blood alcohol level had risen to 0.180, almost twice the legal limit at the time.</p>
    <p id="b864-9" data-blocks='[["BL_864.10",864,[1004,1942,751,612]]]'>Before trial began, defendant made motions to suppress and to dismiss on the basis -that the Newport police had no jurisdiction to arrest him in Jamestown. Initially, the trial justice granted the motion, subject to reconsideration. She determined that if the officer had probable cause to arrest, then, because he witnessed a misdemeanor, G.L.1956 § 12-7-3 gave him the jurisdictional authority to make that arrest because it doesn’t “establish territorial limits for peace officers!.]”</p>

      <a id="p833" href="#p833" data-label="833" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*833</a>The defendant then renewed his motion to suppress. He asserted that the Newport police did not have jurisdiction to arrest him under the common law and that neither of the two statutory exceptions applied to the facts in this case because the situation did not involve a close pursuit, as requtred by § 12-7-19, and because the Jamestown police never contacted the Newport police department to request emergency police assistance, as required by G.L.1956 § 45-42-1. The trial justice denied the motion finding that, for purposes of § 45-42-1, when Sgt. Donovan accepted Sgt. Field’s offer of help, that acceptance was sufficient to constitute a request by a designee of the Jamestown Police Chief for emergency police assistance from the Newport police. After waiving his right to a jury trial, defendant was convicted in the Superior Court for the crime of driving while intoxicated.</p>

There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, when the police are in “hot pursuit” of a suspect, they may cross into another jurisdiction pursuant to § 12-7-19. Second, in emergency situations, it may be necessary and appropriate for the police from one jurisdiction to exercise authority in another jurisdiction. See § 45-42-1; <em>State v. Locke, </em><a href="/a2d/418/0843-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="418 A.2d 843" data-case-ids="7959036" data-case-paths="/a2d/418/0843-01">418 A.2d 843</a>, 847 (R.I.1980); <em>Cioci v.

He contends that it is only after a police chief, or one of his or her designees, specifically requests emergency assistance from another police department that the members of that second police department obtain authority to act in the other jurisdiction. In this case, defendant asserts that no such request ever was made and he points out that it was the Newport police officers’ own superior officer who ordered them to the scene of the accident. He maintains that although Sgt. Field offered his assistance to Sgt. Donovan, there is no evidence that his offer was officially or verbally accepted.

Many lives were in danger due to the number of occupied vehicles that were trapped in the eastbound lanes between the scene of the accident and the toll booths. Time was of the essence in averting a catastrophe. When Sgt. Field arrived at the scene to offer his assistance, Sgt. Donovan immediately seized upon the opportunity to develop an emergency evacuation plan with him. As Sgt. Field’s police cruiser was the only police cruiser available to implement their emergency evacuation plan, it was absolutely crucial that both the cruiser and Sgt. Field be empowered to set up the blockade and to control traffic.</p>

Donovan, it is absurd to have expected him to engage in some stylized ritual in order to officially accept Sgt. Field’s offer of assistance. Such a requirement would have placed an onerous burden upon him when time was of the essence in saving lives and property. When Sgt. Donovan formulated an evacuation plan with Sgt.

It is also worthy of note that the Legislature in P.L.2002, ch. 142, § 1, authorized agreements between adjacent municipalities to provide cooperative assistance by one municipality to the other in non-emergency situations. This statute is not relevant to the case at bar and does require substantial formal approval by both municipal councils. Nevertheless, it is illustrative that legislative policy supports cooperation between municipalities in providing police assistance even in situations where no emergency exists.</p>
