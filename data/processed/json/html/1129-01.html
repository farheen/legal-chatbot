The contract plans estimated that over three million cubic yards of Class I excavation and 2.8 million cubic yards of embankment would be required, with two large fills at the north and <a id="p1132" href="#p1132" data-label="1132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1132</a>sound ends of the site. Green was the low bidder on this project with a bid price of $15,689,753.88. The contract consisted of several documents including DOT’s Form 408 specifications, project plans, and a project schedule that provided a planned duration of 761 calendar days to perform all work, beginning on the date of the notice to proceed, and carried liquidated damages of $800 for each day of work exceeding the 761-day duration.</p>
    <p id="b1198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.4",1198,[218,728,759,1522]]]'>In July 1984, DOT issued to Green a notice to proceed with the project. Because of numerous delays, which shall be further addressed below, Green substantially completed the project on June 30, 1988, or about 1,445 days after the written notice to proceed. DOT accordingly assessed liquidated damages against Green for 683 calendar days at the contract rate of $300 per day. In May 1990, Green filed with the Board a complaint on its own behalf and on behalf of Chapin, one of its paving subcontractors, alleging, inter alia, that it incurred additional costs in 1985 caused by the impact of excessive DOT requirements on Class I excavation; DOT’s actions constituted actual or constructive fraud upon Green; a DOT-imposed work suspension disrupted Green from its embankment operations; DOT was required to compensate Green for its costs pursuant to force account provisions of the contract; DOT issued extra work orders without granting additional contract time; DOT failed to design the project in a manner which would permit Green to be able to timely perform the work; the assessment of liquidated damages was improper because the delay was caused solely by DOT’s own acts; DOT’s delays and contract changes required Green to incur subcontractor delay damage claims; and DOT improperly rejected payment for standby equipment under force account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

During the course of designing the project, Benatec Associates (Benatec), DOT’s engineering consultant, prepared a soils and geological engineering investigation report for the project, incorporated into DOT plans, recommending that during construction of the embankment, special consideration be given to controlling compaction of the embankment and foundation due to the high moisture content and the type of fine-grain material. Also, soil bor-ings were made available to contractors. It was through Green’s site inspection and evaluation of the Benatec survey that Green became aware of the very wet conditions on the south end of the project and hard rock in the north end. Green assumed the rock to be easily “rippable” after observing another company’s drillers in an area adjacent to the project site.</p>
    <p id="b1198-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1198.10",1198,[1022,1155,752,753]]]'>Regarding the project description, contract, and pre-bid background, the Board found, inter alia, that although Green personnel inspected the project site, they took no sofi borings, conducted no subsurface investigation, and reviewed neither the Benatec report nor the available soil borings. Further, the calculations Green used in bidding the project did not take into account other operations that might impact the earth-moving project; Green did not consider the moisture content of materials in formulating the bid; Green did not plan on drilling and shooting the rock; and Green’s estimate for the project did not account for any equipment, trucks, or loaders for rock excavation.</p>

In October 1984, there was evidence of instability indicated by “pumping” under weight of construction equipment; Green had started a two-shift operation in October, but stopped such operations on its own accord after only four days; and after the winter shutdown called for by the contract, Green did not resume earth work production until March 7, 1985, although the contract called for production resuming on February 15, 1985. The Board found that Green lost much productive time during its self-imposed suspension of work.</p>
    <p id="b1199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1199.4",1199,[158,928,755,1179]]]'>Regarding 1985 operations, the Board found that as of April 1985, Green’s earth work was behind schedule and the soil embankment continued to exhibit instability, as indicated by deep rutting and movement under construction equipment; because of severe rutting in the south embankment caused by Green’s equipment, DOT halted the operation on several occasions in April and May of 1985. In late May, DOT suggested several ways that Green could correct the problem it experienced in achieving stability, including a test which utilized Green equipment already on the site; by August, embankment work on the south end was satisfactory and shaped for drainage; when Green reached the hard rock which needed to be drilled and shot, it ultimately had to rent a fleet of rock excavating equipment; most of Green’s rock excavation consisted of drill and shoot operations; and prior to its 1985 winter shutdown, Green had, pursuant to contract specifications, constructed an earth noise barrier and the required embankments, all of which were stable.</p>
    <p id="b1199-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1199.5",1199,[159,2141,754,610]],["BL_1199.6",1199,[959,239,755,710]]]'>As for 1986 operations, the Board found that during the 1985-86 winter shutdown, a portion of one of the earth noise barriers failed due to a Benatec design error; DOT issued a work order for removal of the failed barrier; and in March 1986, DOT began a project site investigation of slope stability and suspended further operations pending investigation. At this point, DOT knew that its suspension of the embankment and bridge work would directly affect the paving and most of the remaining work and that the project’s duration would be extended beyond the contract’s completion date. In April, Green performed force account work on the embankment, and in July, DOT lifted the suspension of work and notified Green that the force account work ceased as of that point. On many occasions after work resumed in July 1986, DOT inspectors halted the fill operations despite the fact that density and compaction requirements were being achieved; and because of loading restrictions and the presence of the testing instruments left by DOT in the embankments after it lifted the suspension, Green’s rate of production on the west embankment was substantially impacted after July 1986.</p>
    <p id="b1199-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1199.7",1199,[958,975,756,1090]]]'>Regarding 1987 operations, the Board found that DOT issued a work order directing Green to undercut several stations; and this work did not prevent J.L. Foster (Foster), the subcontractor that was to perform fine grading and subbase operations on the project, from proceeding in the westbound lanes. In April, Foster encountered rocks in the subgrade of Green’s rough grade; and Foster’s subgrade preparation was impeded by rain for a substantial part of May which necessarily delayed accomplishment of the paving operation by Chapin. Once Chapin began operations it encountered numerous equipment problems, breakdowns, and picket lines at its concrete plant site; on October 16,1987, DOT directed Chapin to stop paving since the “spray cure” was not in place at least twelve hours prior to the paving operation; and during the 1987 construction season, there were numerous delays in the construction of the pavement structure that were not caused by DOT.</p>

    <p id="b1200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.4",1200,[218,438,757,800]]]'>Nonetheless, the Board found that Green grossly underestimated the effort required for rock excavation, failed to timely provide rock trucks and loaders required for the job, and Green’s use of three different rented rock truck fleets was further evidence of Green’s disarray in its management of the Class I excavation. DOT paid Green $2,514,-903.18 on a force account basis for the Class I excavation work performed between April 1, 1986 and July 14, 1986, but would not pay for idle equipment; and the evidence also established additional Class I excavation costs incurred by Green for which DOT was responsible as well as the reasonable requests for material cost increases to Foster and Chapin.</p>
    <p id="b1200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.5",1200,[212,1262,758,1138]]]'>In its conclusions of law, the Board noted that Green’s bid was not realistic because it was unprepared to handle the rock that was found in the site and the degree of water found in the material. The Board also concluded that Green is not entitled to any compensation for Chapin’s use-plaintiff claim because it failed to prove with reasonable certainty that DOT was in any way responsible for any such costs. The Board stressed that DOT plans accurately reflected the amount of rock at the site and the moisture content of the soil. With regard to Green’s claim for compensation for idle equipment during the April to July 1986 force account period, the Board held that DOT was not liable to pay for equipment which was idle by no action of DOT. Based on testimony from Timothy Van Noy, DOT’s expert witness in construction project cost accounting, regarding the total standby not paid for by DOT on the work order associated with scraper dirt excavation, the Board awarded an amount it deemed fair and adequate compensation.</p>

The Board held that the record is replete with evidence of delays as to the 1987 operations due to Green’s method of operation and Chapin’s delays in performing contract work. Although Green sought $1,026,-000 in damages for extended site overhead delays, the Board found that even though DOT was responsible for the delay, Green’s actual costs for the period were $608,606.</p>
    <p id="b1200-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.8",1200,[1018,783,754,708]]]'>The Board further held that despite DOT’s awareness that completion of the project was extended by DOT-directed extra work and suspensions, DOT failed to grant any time extensions and instead imposed liquidated damages. The Board found that extension of time was justifiable and abated the assessment of liquidated damages. Both Foster and Chapin were found by the Board to be entitled to costs related to material price increases as a result of the suspension, but Chapin was not entitled to reimbursement for replacement of transfer dowel baskets, which DOT found unsatisfactory, because Chapin produced no invoice.</p>
    <p id="b1200-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1200.9",1200,[1013,1522,756,939]]]'>The Board denied Green’s and Chapin’s claim for $2,599,034.64 from DOT because the sum represents a judgment entered in a federal court action filed by Chapin and against Green and its insurance company. The Board noted that the project records are filled with evidence of delays to the paving operations from Green’s method of instruction, including the operations of the subbase contractor; from Chapin’s problems on the job; and from Chapin’s decision to suspend paving operations in November 1987. Moreover, Green never notified DOT of any delay in the paving operation. On December 17, 1992, the Board entered its award in favor of Green and against DOT. It further ordered that interest at the statutory rate of six percent shall be paid from August 30, 1988, the date of completion of the directed extra work.</p>

The Board did not determine that Green was required to perform extra work for which it was not compensated. Rather, the record clearly demonstrates that much of the “extra work” Green claims to have been required to do was the result, among other things, of its failure to conduct subsurface investigations prior to bidding on the project, its failure to initially account for the amount and density of the rock at the site, and its inability to achieve the required lift thickness and stability specifications of the contract. The suggestions made by DOT to Green regarding ways that Green could correct the problems it experienced with achieving stability did not rise to the level of extra work and the equipment used to correct the problems was not rented to meet DOT’s suggestions.</p>

Moreover, although Green’s initial bid was based on its belief that the rock on the site could be easily ripped, in fact the bulk of Green’s rock excavation consisted of drill and shoot operations which made Green’s operation inefficient and considerably more costly, as well as creating a need for changing the direction for a haul road. Therefore, the Board was correct in finding no entitlement to compensation for any alleged extra work for 1985 Class I excavation where Green was unprepared for site conditions due solely to its own inadvertence.</p>

A review of the record supports the Board’s determination that Green was entitled to additional costs of the Class I excavation in the amount of $390,448.85, which was appropriately based on only those costs incurred by Green for which DOT was responsible, and not on the total cost of the Class I excavation for 1986.

In this respect, the Board found that work not contained in the contract was required. This Court concluded that, as in <em>Trumbull, </em>the costs were increased as a result of a change in the amount of work designated by DOT and therefore, force account provisions of the contract were to be put into effect.

On the contrary, the Board in this instance was compelled to examine the nature and circumstances of Green’s bid in order to determine the extent of damages allowable under the contract between Green and DOT. Where, as here, it has been established that through no fault or misrepresentation by DOT a contractor has encountered difficulties in execution of the contract requirements due solely to the contractor’s own preparations, DOT cannot be held hable for damages under force account provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Green contends that DOT’s suspensions and directives were responsible for forcing the paving operations into 1987, and DOT is likewise responsible for the expiration of Chapin’s original subcontract prices. The Board’s findings, however, detail extensive delays in 1987 operations, beginning with the delay when Foster encountered rocks in Green’s subgrade, which in turn delayed Chapin’s paving operations. The Board also specifically found that Green failed to properly construct the embankments which led to extensive extra work for Foster. Although the Board concluded that Foster and Chapin experienced increased material costs in 1987 because of DOT’s suspension and delay, the record is replete with evidence supporting the Board’s determination that the numerous delays in construction of the paving structure were not caused by DOT, but rather by such things as Chapin’s equipment problems, and Green’s failure to complete a bridge approach and the subbase in time for paving.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b1206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1206.4",1206,[209,934,757,824]]]'>Finally, DOT argues that the Board erred by failing to pro-rate time-related damages in its award for Count IV time-related additional costs, Count V extended site overhead, and Count VI abatement of liquidated damages. DOT contends that because of the Board’s findings regarding delays due to actions by Green, Foster, and Chapin, the Board must apportion the time-related damages between the parties according to their respective responsibility for delay. A review of the Board’s findings and conclusions however reveals that the Board clearly acknowledged the responsibility of each party for the delays, and it is apparent that the Board considered their respective liabilities in arriving at the award amount. Therefore, the Board did not err in this regard.</p>
