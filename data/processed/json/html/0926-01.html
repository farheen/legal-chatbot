Kitehings with fifteen counts of various violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including neglect (Rule 1.3), failure to keep his clients informed (Rule 1.4), and failure to protect a client’s interest after representation ended (Rule 1.16). Kitehings ultimately disputed none of these charges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Instead, he signed two stipulations: the first admitted the substance of three counts, and the second admitted the remaining twelve.</p>

The memorandum indicated that it did not bind the hearing committee, the Board, or this court, and that Bar Counsel retained the authority to prosecute any counts not considered by this court as a basis for discipline. The memorandum stated that Kitehings signed it “to avoid the burden and expense of defending against further charges that would arise from [his] conduct as set forth in the Second Stipulations.”</p>

First, the Board found them to be a “plea bargain” or “negotiated disposition” beyond the authority of Bar Counsel. Second, Bar Counsel had no power, according to the Board, to urge the hearing committee to dismiss the charges of the second stipulation when contact members appointed by the Board had not given him permission to do so. Third, the Board found that Kitehings had signed the memorandum agreeing to a six-month suspension and the second stipulation under duress because of threats that Bar Counsel purportedly made to him. Instead, the Board recommended a thirty-day suspension, based solely on the violations admitted in the first stipulation, and directed Bar Counsel to continue to prosecute the other twelve charged violations.</p>

Although Bar Counsel in this case did not proceed in the usual manner, there was no unauthorized dismissal or plea bargain. Rather, the twelve counts of the second stipulation formed the basis for an enhanced sanction — a six-month suspension with a fitness requirement — in the nature of aggravating factors. We see nothing more than harmless error in the failure of Bar Counsel to obtain preapproval from contact members. Because nothing was dismissed, and the memorandum expressly provided that the Board was not bound by its terms, Bar Counsel did nothing more than try to anticipate — in this case incor<a id="p929" href="#p929" data-label="929" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*929</a>rectly — the decision of the contact members. We also conclude that the Board erred in not deferring to the findings of the hearing committee with respect to duress. The presence of duress is a matter of fact, <em>see Sind v. Pollin, </em><a href="/a2d/356/0653-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="356 A.2d 653" data-case-ids="8035626" data-case-paths="/a2d/356/0653-01">356 A.2d 653</a>, 656 (D.C.1976), and the Board must accept factual findings supported by substantial evidence, such as these. <em>See In re Micheel, </em><a href="/a2d/610/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="610 A.2d 231" data-case-ids="7924000" data-case-paths="/a2d/610/0231-01">610 A.2d 231</a>, 234 (D.C.1992).

For example, when asked about his alleged failure to deliver a client’s file, he claimed that the stipulation was wrong. When asked why he signed the stipulation, Kitchings accused Bar Counsel of intimidating him, “harassing]” him, and threatening to “make it difficult” if he did not admit to the second set of charges.

Bar R. XI, § 8(b). Bar Counsel recommended to the two contact members involved that the charges of the second stipulation be “deemed dismissed” for “record-keeping purposes,” despite the fact that all twelve charges were being considered by the hearing committee as part of an overall pattern of misconduct. The contact members, at the direction of the Board, <a id="p931" href="#p931" data-label="931" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*931</a>declined to deem the charges dismissed, and instead directed Bar Counsel to “prosecute” them.</p>

    <p id="b973-8" data-blocks='[["BL_973.7",973,[167,1822,753,612]]]'>As a preliminary matter, we note that both the Board and Bar Counsel used words in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary meaning throughout these proceedings. Bar Counsel urged that claims that it was presenting to the hearing committee be “deemed dismissed.” The Board directed Bar Counsel to “prosecute” claims that already had been presented to the hearing committee. The Board discerned a “plea bargain” where nothing had been bargained for.</p>
    <p id="b973-10" data-blocks='[["BL_973.8",973,[970,302,754,620]]]'>We reject this terminology and will adhere to common legal usage. A “dismissal” is the “[termination of an action ... without further hearing.” Black’s Law Dictionary 482 (7th ed.1999). To “prosecute” is to “carry out a legal action.” <em>Id. </em>at 1237. A “plea bargain” is a “negotiated agreement” in which a party “pleads guilty to a lesser offense or to one of multiple charges in exchange for some concession by the prosecutor, usually a more lenient sentence or a dismissal of the other charges.” <em>Id. </em>at 1173.</p>
    <p id="b973-11" data-blocks='[["BL_973.9",973,[968,942,755,1493]]]'>This clarification of terms settles the principal issue raised by this case. The Board contends that Bar Counsel exceeded its authority because it had no power to “dismiss” certain charges through a “plea bargain” or “negotiated disposition.” We cannot agree, because we perceive no true dismissal or plea bargain in Bar Counsel’s actions. Bar Counsel presented all fifteen counts to the hearing committee, the Board and this court, and included them in his recommended sanction. If any of the counts were not taken into account in the sanction imposed as part of this proceeding, Bar Counsel retained the authority to prosecute them separately. The memorandum also made clear that all fifteen charges could be raised if Kitchings were to petition for reinstatement. Moreover, Kitchings was given no form of leniency— Bar Counsel recommended a sanction that it deemed “appropriate” for all fifteen violations. The hearing committee concurred in that assessment, and the Board has never contended that Bar Counsel’s recommended sanction would be inappropriate had all charges been formally prosecuted. The purpose of the memorandum was not to reduce Kitchings’s penalties, but, by its terms, to allow him to avoid the cost of litigation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Bar R. XI, § 9(g). Here, the Board contact members reviewing the second stipulation directed Bar Counsel to prosecute the twelve charges it contained.
