This Court resolved the second question in an opinion filed on May 30, 2002, in which we remanded the matter to the PCRA court to file an opinion. <em>Commonwealth v.

We now address the ineffectiveness issue. For the reasons set forth below, we "conclude that no relief is due because the Commonwealth did not impeach appellant’s reputation for truthfulness, but rather merely challenged the veracity of his testimony in this case; accordingly, appellant’s underlying claim that evidence of his good reputation for telling the truth was admissible to rebut the Commonwealth’s attack on his truthful character lacks arguable merit. We therefore affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

These female victims testified that on the night of October 4, 1991, at approximately 10:30 p.m., they were walking together through a deserted schoolyard on the way to M.H.’s mother’s house with M.H’s one-year old child, who was in a stroller, when they became aware that two men were following them. One of these men confronted the women, brandished a gun and announced “this is a stickup.” The second man then approached the victims from behind and ordered them to go to a darkened stairway on the side of the school. The victims complied, and once they were in the stairway, they were ordered to hand over their money and jewelry to the two men. The man who had initially brandished a gun then fled the scene, but the second man remained. He ordered the women to lie down on their stomachs and then forced each woman to perform oral sex on him. He then raped and sodomized L.S.

Appellant testified that at some time prior to nightfall on October 4,1991, he attempted to enter his house but was unable to do so because the house was locked, he did not have a key and no one else was at home. He then went across the street to the home of Titus Lawhorn. Appellant testified that he spent the entire night at Lawhorn’s house drinking beer and socializing and did not leave the house until some time between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. on October 5. Lawhorn, Lawhorn’s fiancee, Rene Washington, and Tywanda Butler also testified on appellant’s behalf that appellant spent the entire night of the crimes at Lawhorn’s home.</p>

Appellant then filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for relief under the PCRA. New counsel was appointed and amended petitions were filed. The PCRA court dismissed appellant’s PCRA petition without a hearing. After appellant appealed to the Superior Court, the PCRA court filed a brief opinion in which it failed to articulate its independent view of why summary dismissal was appropriate, but instead adopted the “discussion” of the issues set forth by the Commonwealth in its Motion to Dismiss “as controlling.”</p>

Regarding the PCRA court’s wholesale adoption of the Commonwealth’s Motion to Dismiss, the Superior Court acknowledged the rule announced in the capital case of <em>Commonwealth v.(Roy) Williams, </em>557 Pa.207, <a href="/a2d/732/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="732 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="11553069,56907" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/1167-01,/pa/557/0207-01">732 A.2d 1167</a> (1999), requiring a PCRA court to provide an independent expression of its reasons for summarily dismissing a PCRA petition, but concluded that this rule was inapplicable to non-capital cases. On the question of whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence of appellant’s alleged good reputation for truthfulness, the panel majority noted that character evidence of the defendant’s truthfulness is admissible only if: (1) the character trait of truthfulness is implicated by the elements of the charged offenses; or (2) the defendant’s character for truthfulness was attacked by evidence of bad reputation. Finding neither circumstance to be implicated here, the panel majority concluded that character evidence of truthfulness would not have been admissible and, therefore, counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue and present such evidence. Judge Del Sole dissented on both the procedural question and the reputation evidence question. The dissent concluded that the case should have been remanded for “an independent judicial analysis and opinion.” In addition, Judge Del Sole noted that he would have deemed evidence of appellant’s character for truthfulness admissible because credibility was of paramount importance at appellant’s trial.</p>

Appellant contends that this evidence of his reputation for truthfulness was admissible to rebut the Commonwealth’s impeachment of his character for telling the truth. Appellant notes that the eyewitness testimony of the complainants directly contradicted his testimony that he did not attack the victims and that he was somewhere other than the scene of the crimes at the time they occurred. Appellant further notes that the prosecutor aggressively cross-examined him and challenged his veracity in her closing argument. Appellant contends that the complainants’ testimony and the prosecutor’s attacks on the truthfulness of his testimony placed his character for truthfulness at issue. In this situation, appellant argues, “well-settled controlling authorities]” — in particular, two decisions of this Court, <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition, appellant contends that since his trial counsel swore in an affidavit filed with the PCRA court that he did not even consider calling witnesses to testify as to appellant’s good reputation for truthfulness, trial counsel could not have had a reasonable basis for failing to present such evidence. Finally, appellant asserts that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness because “[t]here is no question that counsel’s failure to present character evidence under these circumstances ‘undermined [his] chances of instilling reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.’ ” Brief for Appellant at 20 (quoting <em>Weiss, </em><a href="/pa/530/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="530 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1833026" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0001-01">606 A.2d at 443</a>).</p>

The Commonwealth argues that this claim could have been raised on direct appeal but was not, and the allegation is thus waived for purposes of the PCRA. On the merits, the Commonwealth contends that the law in Pennsylvania has long been that a defendant in a criminal case may not offer evidence of his good character for truthfulness to bolster his credibility unless his character for truthfulness has first been attacked by the prosecution. The Commonwealth asserts that, although the prosecution contested the truthfulness of appellant’s testimony regarding his actions on the night of the crimes, at no point did the prosecution assail appellant’s character <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>or reputation for truthfulness generally. Thus, the Commonwealth argues that the prosecution did not open the door to the introduction of evidence of appellant’s alleged good reputation for truthfulness and such evidence was therefore inadmissible.

Given the net effect of these statements, I cannot conclude that Appellant’s ineffectiveness claim lacks arguable merit, especially as the central issue in this case was one of credibility which turned on whether to believe the victims’ testimony or that of Appellant and his alibi witnesses. Therefore, I would remand in order for the PCRA court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Appellant has established the requisite prejudice to prevail on his ineffectiveness claim, particularly since the PCRA judge did not preside over Appellant’s trial.</p>

Although Appellant has not argued that he should have been permitted to introduce evidence of his character for truthfulness, because the trait of truthfulness is relevant to the robbery charge, I note that this Court has held that a robbery conviction involves an element of dishonesty and constitutes a <em>cri-men falsi </em>that may be used to impeach a defendant's veracity. <em>See Commonwealth v.

I would note that Pennsylvania law prohibits the use of specific instances of a witness’s own misconduct for the purpose of attacking the witness’s character for truthfulness, and, thus, an objection on that basis might have foreclosed the prosecutor from pursing this matter. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1). Rule 608(b)(1) differs from Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), as the federal analogue gives the court discretion to permit the cross-examination of a witness concerning specific instances of misconduct when the incidents are probative of the witness's own character for truthfulness. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 608 cmt; F.R.E. 608(b).</p>
