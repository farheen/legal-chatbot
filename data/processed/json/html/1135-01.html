The Agreement provides for the District of Columbia, various municipalities in Virginia (referred to as “Political Subdivisions”), and Montgomery County and Prince George’s County in Maryland (referred to as “Guarantors”) to provide funding for four WMATA construction projects, including the Branch Avenue Metro Station where Rodrigues-Novo was working.

Appellees, however, point to Section 10 of the Agreement as evidence that WMATA, as owner and contractor for the Branch Avenue site, is required to perform construction work for Prince George’s County. Section 10 states that if one of the planned projects (such as the Branch Avenue Metro Station) did not receive approval from the Federal Transportation Administration, WMATA would work on an alternate project in the same jurisdiction with the allocated funds. While Section 10 clarifies the responsibilities of each of the funding municipalities, we find no language, in Section 10 or elsewhere in the Agreement, specifically indicating that WMATA will actually perform construction work, rather than acting as the conduit for funds to reach construction contractors. Nonetheless, we think the issue of whether the Agreement is an antecedent contract within the scope of <em>Brady </em>presents an unanswered question of Maryland law. There is no clear line between a “mere financing agreement” and the type of antecedent contract that, in the totality of circumstances here, could provide WMATA with statutory employer immunity.</p>

The parties at oral argument acknowledged that the question of law presented in this certification with respect to WMATA depends upon the documentary evidence in the record, including the WMATA Compact, the referenced Fifth Interim Capital Contributions Agreement, and the contract between WMATA and Recchi, in the context of the other undisputed facts set forth in this order of certification and as may be jointly supplemented by the parties.

Appellants suggest, rather weakly, that Rec-chi itself may not be a statutory employer because the work being undertaken by Rodri-gues-Novo was not within the scope of the relevant contracts.
