Appellants stated that Mr. Waters mailed a second letter to Appellee on February 2, 2005, stating that Mr. Waters represented his brother’s estate. Appellants averred that Mr. Waters received correspondence from Appellee on February 22, 2005, which contained a payoff figure in the amount of $10,598.19. Mr. Waters averred that he called Appellee’s counsel on the following day requesting an explanation for certain costs. Thereafter, on March 16, 2005, Mr. Waters received correspondence from mortgagee’s counsel requesting that Attorney Waters execute a ‘Waiver By Heir of Right to be Named as a Defendant in Foreclosure Action.” Mr. Waters did not complete this waiver, but, on the same day, Mr. Waters called the mortgagee and asked for another explanation of the payoff figure. Mr. Waters also contacted the mortgagee by telephone on June 16, 2005 and July 7, 2005. After each call, Mr. Waters received correspondence indicating an updated payoff figure. Mr. Waters contacted the mortgagee again on July 12, 2005. Despite this activity, Appel-lee obtained a default judgment on July 21, 2005. Appellants aver that they always intended to pay any and all arrears and reasonable costs associated with the property. They further stated that Appellee improperly filed a petition for alternative service while knowing that Mr. Waters was an heir to the mortgagor’s estate.

Therefore, we agree with Appellants that Appellee did not provide proper service of the action and, as a result, the Court of Common Pleas did not have jurisdiction to enter a default judgment against Appellants. <em>See Deer Park Lumber, Inc., supra.</em>

We note that Appellee does have a pending motion to reassess damages before the trial court. In our view, this motion has no effect upon the finality of the February 24, 2006 order or the underlying judgment; rather, this motion invokes the trial court’s equitable power to enforce the underlying judgment and to grant relief until the judgment is discharged or satisfied. <em>See Stephenson v.

In its appellate brief, Appellee further argues that our Court should quash Appellants’ appeal due to deficiencies in Appellants’ brief. Appellee’s Brief, at 15. Specifically, Appellee <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>maintained that Appellants did not contain a statement of jurisdiction, a statement of the scope and standard of review, the text of the order in question, a copy of the Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal, a Statement of Questions, or citation to the record in the argument section. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. On October 31, 2006, Appellants filed an application to amend its original brief to conform to the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Our Court granted this request on November 30, 2006, and Appellants filed an amended brief on December 6, 2006. As the amended brief includes a statement of jurisdiction, a statement of the scope and standard of review, a copy of the order under review, a copy of the Concise Statement, and a Statement of Questions, we will not quash the instant appeal as non-compliant.</p>
