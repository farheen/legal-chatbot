    <blockquote id="b104-14" data-blocks='[["BL_104.18",104,[297,1313,1180,289]]]'>On these subsidiary facts, I make the ultimate or general finding that the fire and the resulting damage to the landlord’s property was the result of the negligence of the tenant. Notwithstanding this conclusion, the plaintiff cannot recover as a matter of law... A tenant at will is liable at common law for voluntary but not for permissive waste. Permissive waste consists of neglect or omission while voluntary waste is active or positive waste.</blockquote>

Appellant is aggrieved by the Court’s determination that appellee’s conduct constituted permissive waste rather than active waste.</p>
    <p id="b104-16" data-blocks='[["BL_104.20",104,[223,1837,1330,287]]]'>In his finding, the judge specifically found that the appellee was a tenant at will and that the fire in question originated in a box of newspapers which had been stored next to the stove. Based on these subsidiary findings the judge found that appellee was not liable for damages because the injury resulted from his omission to safeguard the fire properly. Based on his subsidiary facts the judge found that appellee’s conduct consisted of permissive waste, rather than voluntary waste. Correctly, the judge held that no action would lie for permissive waste.</p>
