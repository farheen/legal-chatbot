Our supreme court expressly stated in <em>Hebden </em>that, once a claimant proves that he is disabled as a result of an <em>occupational disease, </em>the disability and its cause may not be relit-igated. This is because, as Justice Cappy stated, despite modern medicine, occupational diseases are progressive; thus, the claimant’s medical condition and loss of earning power do not improve. Clearly, this reasoning is not applicable in a nonoccupational disease scenario.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> However, because I do <a id="p1332" href="#p1332" data-label="1332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1332</a>not believe that Larry R.

However, in the present controversy, Joseph R. Sabo, M.D., Claimant’s medical expert, testified that he diagnosed Claimant’s work-related injury as “nerve root irritation with sciatica with radicular pain, severe LS [sic] sprain.” (O.R., Dr. Sabo’s Deposition of April 29,1993 at 10.)
