    <p id="b962-12" data-blocks='[["BL_962.9",962,[1015,1204,749,615]]]'>The record on appeal shows the following facts. Mrs. Beeton began working for the DOC around August 1986, and in 1989 was stationed at the DOC Modular Facility at Lorton, Virginia (“the Facility”) where the incidents giving rise to this lawsuit occurred. She was a correctional officer, and was commonly addressed as “Corporal.” In August 1989 she was named the Officer in Charge (“OIC”) of the Facility’s Control Center (Shift No. 2) through the Master Roster system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

She functioned satisfactorily until she was removed in October 1989, after the publication of an article in The Modular Circular, a Facility-created newsletter, which implied that she had received the position through a connection. However, after she filed a complaint in the trial court challenging her removal, the trial judge concluded that Mrs. Beetoris “removal was not based on any just cause related to her performance of duties,” and that “she was replaced by a less experienced officer....”</p>
    <p id="b963-5" data-blocks='[["BL_963.4",963,[183,1124,753,875]]]'>At trial on her defamation and wrongful termination claims, Mrs. Beeton asserted that she was humiliated as a result of the article, and became depressed and withdrawn. Her marital relationship also deteriorated, and she lost the ability to be intimate with her husband. She sought therapy, and was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. From her perspective, the article implied that she received the post in an “illicit” manner, and thus, her reputation was tainted as a consequence. She took time off from work<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and was terminated in September 1991 for being absent without official leave. She was reinstated in May 1992, however, and awarded back pay as well as benefits.</p>

The appellate record reveals the following factual background pertinent to our review of Mrs. Beeton’s defamation claim. In 1989, the administrator of the Facility authorized the publication of a newsletter, called The Modular Circular, to boost employee morale, and allow staff members an opportunity to vent and voice their concerns. The September 5, 1989 issue of the newsletter included an article voicing contempt for <a id="p922" href="#p922" data-label="922" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*922</a>the Facility’s bidding process used to fill certain positions. One paragraph in particular noted that a certain female corporal always received “choice” assignments because of some sort of “Connection to which other [correctional] officers [were] not privy[.]” The article was entitled <em>Teamsters Local 1714 News </em>and read in relevant part:</p>

J.L. Bryant. They are of the opinion that it would have been more fitting to assign a Sergeant or Senior Corporal to that position. Officers admitted that it appear to them that this Junior Corporal always seem to get “choice” assignments, none of which have (as of this writing) been dormitory or cellblock assignments. Could she perhaps have a “Connection” to which other officers are not privy?</blockquote>

One witness testified that, after reading the article, he and others believed that Mrs. Beeton had provided sexual favors to get the OIC post. The article did not mention Mrs. Beeton by name, but the record supports the trial judge’s finding that it was “widely understood by the readership of The Modular Circular” that Mrs. Beeton was its subject; she was the only female corporal assigned daily to the OIC position at that time.</p>

In fact, Charles Watts was suggested as the possible author, but was never called as a witness to confirm that he wrote the article, and there was no evidence presented to establish any negative relationship between the Beetons and Mr. Watts.

The District argues that Mrs. Beeton was made whole for all her liquidated damages, and that the trial court correctly concluded that § 12-309 bars her recovery for the requested unliquidated damages. The trial court found that the unliquidated damages she demanded for wrongful termination were related to her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which was dismissed before trial for failure to give the District notice under § 12-309.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> We agree that the damages Mrs. Beeton seeks are unliquidated because they are not “ ‘an easily ascertainable sum certain.’ ” <em>See Hartford Accident and Indem.
