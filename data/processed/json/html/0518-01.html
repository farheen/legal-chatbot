More specifically, the Commission alleged that he sold the Life Settlement contract, i.e., a limited life expectancy insurance contract, also known as a “viatical” contract, on behalf of himself and Empire State Financial Group, LLC (Empire), a New York entity with its principal place of business in New York, New York.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The cease and <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>desist order further alleged that Steller mailed a Pennsylvania resident materials containing information on the purchase of a Life Settlement from Empire,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> offered to sell the Pennsylvania. resident the Life Settlement, and then told the Pennsylvania resident that she could purchase a portion of a policy and her investment could be pooled with the investment of other Empire investors in order to purchase the policies. As a result of receiving the cease and desist order, Steller requested an administrative hearing alleging that he did not offer to sell a Pennsylvania investor a limited partnership interest, and that interest, which was a Life Settlement, was different from a “viatical” contract and was not a security so it did not need to be registered with the Commission.</p>

McCurdy (McCur-dy), an undercover agent testifying on behalf of the Commission, stated that she received a file with an advertisement in it for Steller Performance regarding investments. She called Steller Performance requesting more information and received a brochure. She then contacted Steller via telephone with questions. He told her the brochure dealt with Life Settlements and explained how they worked. Essentially, he told her that an individual could choose to sell his or her life insurance policy to a company that would offer it to investors who would purchase the policy at less than face value. When the insured died, the investor would receive the face value of the policy. The insured would only be expected to live three to six years after being evaluated by doctors, and the investor could expect to triple his or her investment. McCurdy stated that at the time she spoke with Steller, she had no contact with any doctors, Empire or the person with the limited life expectancy; only Stel-ler. She further stated that Steller told her that the minimum investment would be $10,000 and that three people would invest $10,000 each for a total of $80,000 for a minimum policy worth $100,000 which would be held by a limited partnership which would own the policy. Upon death of the insured, the investor would receive that portion of the policy which they contributed. Steller also told McCurdy that he worked on 100% commission. McCur-dy stated that when she explained to Stel-ler that she did not have enough money to invest, Steller offered her the ability to go into a fractionalized limited partnership.</p>

However, he explained that he would have merely been a referral source to Empire without receiving any compensation. Further, once he found out that McCurdy did not have enough money to purchase an entire life settlement, she ceased being a client. No evidence was presented by Steller that he had made an investment contract interest filing or limited partnership interest filing as required under Section 612(a) of the Act, 70 P.S. § 612(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Regarding the “viatical” settlement contracts, Steller, relying upon Barron’s Business Guides Dictionary of Insurance Terms, testified that viatical settlement contracts were not the same as Life Settlements because they only applied to those individuals who had less than two years to live, whereas Life Settlements were limited to individuals whose life expectancies were three to six years.</p>
    <p id="b549-8" data-blocks='[["BL_549.7",549,[972,548,752,468]]]'>The Hearing Officer determined that despite the fact that no documents had exchanged hands between Steller and McCurdy, an offer to sell to McCurdy the opportunity to get into the Life Settlement investment had occurred. The Hearing Officer found Steller’s position that he could be a referral source without compensation unconvincing:</p>
    <blockquote id="b549-9" data-blocks='[["BL_549.8",549,[1010,1052,718,991]]]'>The compensation comes from the commission he would receive on the actual sale of the life settlement and not from the actual documentation of the partnership. Further, there was extensive discussion in the hearing and through the briefing of the responsibility for finding additional partners and for documenting the limited partnership. It appears that this focus is misplaced. In fact, even if there was no discussion of a limited partnership, the mere continued conversation concerning the combination of McCurdy’s funds with those of others would still be an “investment contract” covered under the Act as “any investment of money by persons in a common enterprise who expect a profit through the efforts of others.”</blockquote>

The Hearing Officer also pointed out that had Steller truly believed that McCurdy was no longer a client once he learned she had no money, he would not have pursued any limited partnership interest. Further, he <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>never informed McCurdy that she was no longer considered a client.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[168,365,754,1175]]]'>The Hearing Officer then relied on the definitions provided by the NAIC and the NASAA to find that the “viatical” settlement contracts and the Life Settlements offered for sale by Steller were the same things. He concluded that Steller had violated Section 201 of the Act by offering the limited partnership interest or investment contract interest to McCurdy; Section 801(a) of the Act by acting as a broker-dealer for Empire by establishing that he would have received a commission for the sale of the Life Settlement to McCurdy; Section 401(b) of the Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> by failing to tell McCurdy that Empire was not registered with the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance to sell viatical policies; that the limited partnership interests he offered to sell her were securities which were not registered; and that he was not a registered broker-dealer.

The Commission then concluded that the Life Settlements were securities within the meaning of Section 102(t) of the Act because they constituted “limited partnership interests,” they were not registered with the Commission and were not exempt from registration, and Steller had violated or was about to violate Section 201 of the Act. It further concluded that Stel-ler was engaged in the business of offering and selling the Life Settlements and, therefore, was a “broker-dealer” within the meaning of Section 102(e) of the Act, and he was not registered with the Commission under Section 301(a) of the Act or exempt from registration under Section 302 of the Act, and, therefore, had violated or was about to violate Section 301(a) of the Act. Finally, the Commission found that in connection with the offers of the Life Settlements, his omission of material facts constituted a violation of Section 401(b) of the Act. On September 14, 2004, the Commission then issued an order affirming the summary order to cease and desist that was issued on February 11, 2003. On October 14, 2004, Steller filed a request for reconsideration and rehearing which was dismissed on October 26, 2004. On November 22, 2004, Steller filed a petition for review with this Court.</p>

He contends that under Barron’s Business Guides Dictionary of Insurance Terms, a viatical settlement applies only in those cases where the insured person has 24 months or less to live. A Life Settlement is limited to those cases where the insured’s life expectancy’s is three to six years. Therefore, he argues that there was no violation of the Act because the Life Settlement was not a security subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction.</p>

However, McCurdy testified that she told him that she was only able to purchase a fraction of a policy and discussions continued between herself and Steller, and the Commission found her position credible.
