The trial court held that the insurer had a duty to search the public records before paying a routine loss, and entered summary judgment in favor of the lienholder and against the insurer.

Smith and Kathy Alexander, t/a Republic Leasing Company, a partnership (hereinafter “Republic Leasing”), purchased a 1986 Chrysler Fifth Avenue and entered into a retail installment contract for payment of the purchase price. This contract was assigned to Chrysler Credit Corporation, which perfected a security interest in the vehicle. A provision of the installment contract also granted Chrysler a security interest in any insurance proceeds of the collateral and required Republic Leasing to maintain insurance naming Chrysler as an additional loss-payee. Chrysler’s security interest was perfected and duly noted on the car’s certificate of title, and Chrysler has continually maintained possession of the title.</p>

On October 20, 1987, however, Republic Leasing terminated the insurance policy with Kemper and obtained coverage under a new policy issued by Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company. On the application for insurance, Chrysler was not identified; and, therefore, it also was not named as a loss-payee in the policy.</p>

In response to a claim under the policy, Pennsylvania National drew a check to Harry G. Smith and Republic Leasing in the amount of $11,666, representing the market value of the car, less the deductible feature of $100. Before the check was delivered, however, the insured advised Pennsylvania National that it wished to retain the vehicle. Instead of drafting a new check, it was agreed that the insurer would deliver the check for $11,666, and the insured would reimburse the insurer for the vehicle’s salvage value of $1,100. As a consequence, the insurer did not acquire title to the dam<a id="p1100" href="#p1100" data-label="1100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1100</a>aged vehicle.

Chrysler then filed an action against the partnership, as well as the individual partners, and also against Pennsylvania National to recover the moneys due it on account of the purchase price of the car. The partnership, as well as the individual partners, commenced bankruptcy proceedings, but Chrysler continued its action against Pennsylvania National. It contended that Pennsylvania National had unlawfully converted collateral when it paid the policy proceeds to the insured without protecting the interest of the lienholder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In response to cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Chrysler and against Pennsylvania National.

This is made clear by the language of subsection (1) referring to acts by the mortgagor: “when collateral or proceeds is sold, exchanged, collected or otherwise disposed of.” These refer to acts of the mortgagor. This conclusion is further reinforced by the language of subsection (2) which refers to “sale, exchange or other disposition thereof by the debtor.” All this language makes it plain that the mortgagee’s lien extends to proceeds received by the debtor.

Section 9-306 of the Uniform Commercial Code, however, does not allow a creditor to bring an action in conversion against an insurer after the proceeds of insurance have been disbursed as provided in the policy of insurance.</p>
    <blockquote id="b1168-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1168.8",1168,[1035,329,716,703]]]'>The question becomes whether an insurer, before paying a routine loss, must conduct a search of public records in order to avoid becoming liable to some secured but otherwise undisclosed creditor. Such a startling — and expensive — requirement is certainly not required by the uniform commercial code. The act provides that insurance proceeds are subject to priority between lien holders. [Sections 9-104 and 9-306.] But these provisions would merely accord [a creditor] a prior right to the insurance proceeds against a third party who might assert a claim or lien against [the collateral],</blockquote>
