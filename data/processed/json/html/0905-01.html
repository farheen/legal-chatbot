Appellant, the District of Columbia, contends that the trial court lacks statutory jurisdiction to direct administrative agencies where to place and how to treat juveniles, who have been adjudicated delinquent and placed in the custody of that agency. We agree with the District of Columbia that in juvenile delinquency proceedings, as distinct from abuse and neglect cases, the court no longer has the statutory authority to direct the placement or future treatment of juveniles who have been committed to a public agency, such as DHS. Therefore, we vacate the trial court’s order to the extent that it directs the placement and treatment of P.S. and remand the case to the trial court for any farther actions consistent with this opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

D.C.Code § 16-2320 (2001) provides the authority for trial judges to issue dispositions in neglect and delinquency cases, and it is the statute that the District of Columbia relies upon to support its contention that the above cited provisions of the supplemental order are unlawful. Subsection (a) of this statute describes the extent of the trial court’s authority in neglect cases, while subsection (c) describes that authority in delinquency cases. Subsection (c) permits Family Court judges handling delinquency matters to exercise most of the options available in subsection (a). According to § 16-2320, if a trial court finds that a child is delinquent or in need of supervision, it may enter a disposition that: 1) permits the child to stay with his or her parents subject to conditions set by the court for the rehabilitation of the juvenile, pursuant to § 16 — 2320(a)(1); 2) place the child under protective supervision, pursuant to § 16-2320(a)(2); 3) place the child in a private organization or facility that is authorized to care for the child, pursuant to § 16-2320(a)(3)(B); 4) place <a id="p909" href="#p909" data-label="909" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*909</a>the child in the care of relatives, pursuant to § 16 — 2320(a)(3)(C); 5) commit the child to an appropriate facility for medical, psychiatric, or other treatment, pursuant to § 16 — 2320(a)(4); 6) “transfer ... legal custody to a public agency for the care of delinquent children,” pursuant to § 16 — 2320(c)(2); and 7) place the child on probation, pursuant to § 16-2320(c)(3). Although the authority to make certain dispositions is similar in delinquency and neglect cases, a judge in a neglect proceeding has broader authority than a judge in a delinquency proceeding because § 16 — 2320(a)(5), permits a judge in a neglect case to “make such other dispositions ... as the [court] deems to be in the best interest of the child [and to] order any public agency of the District of Columbia to provide any service the [court] determines is needed.” There is no analogous provision applicable to delinquency cases.</p>
    <p id="b953-5" data-blocks='[["BL_953.4",953,[135,1473,754,903]],["BL_953.5",953,[938,289,756,1149]]]'>In paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 the trial court is directing either the placement or the treatment of P.S. The District argues that Family Court judges handling delinquency matters no longer have authority to make placement and treatment decisions after custody of the delinquent is transferred to the public agency, pursuant to § 16 — 2320(c)(2). When the legislature amended § 16-2320 in 1993, § 16-2320(a)(5), which previously applied to judges in both neglect and delinquency cases, became applicable only to judges in neglect cases. By limiting § 16-2320(a)(5) to neglect cases, the legislature did two things: 1) it removed the broad authority of the court to make dispositions that are not <em>specifically listed </em>in the statute and 2) it specifically removed the court’s authority to order a public agency to provide specific services in juvenile delinquency cases. Because we recognize that the legislature made a clear distinction between the court’s authority in neglect cases and delinquency cases by expressly limiting the authority of judges in delinquency cases, appellee must prove that the statute specifically gives judges in delinquency cases the authority to make decisions for the placement and treatment of juveniles when the child has been transferred to the custody of an agency, such as DHS. Appellee contends that: 1) despite the 1993 amendments Family Court judges in delinquency matters retain broad authority to make dispositions that are in the best interest of the child and 2) that, in any event, the statute provides trial judges in delinquency cases with specifically granted authority to make placement and treatment decisions.</p>

However, they no longer have that specifically delineated authority. Thus, our decisions prior to 1993 that recognized that the trial court in delinquency matters could exercise such broad authority pursuant to § 16-2320(a)(5) are no longer applicable to the circumstances presented here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

D.C.Code § 16 — 2320(a)(4) provides that the trial court may order the “[cjommitment of the child for medical, psychiatric or other treatment at an appropriate facility on an in-patient basis if, at the disposi-tional hearing ... the [court] finds that confinement is necessary to the treatment of the child.” D.C.Code § 16-2322(a)(4) provides that “[u]nless the order sets a minimum period for commitment of the child, or specifies that release is permitted only by order of the [Family Court], the department, agency, or institution may release the child at any time that it appears the purpose of the disposition order has been achieved.”</p>

While it is true that a trial judge has the authority to directly commit a child to an appropriate facility for “medical, psychiatric or other treatment,” nothing in the statute suggests that § 16-2320(a)(4) should be read in conjunction with § 16-2320(c)(2), which authorizes the court to transfer custody of a delinquent child to a public agency. D.C.Code § 16-2320(a)(4) does not specifically grant trial judges the authority to order a public agency to commit a child for “medical, psychiatric or other treatment.” Further, in our cases construing § 16-2320(a)(4), we have previously interpreted this provision as giving trial judges the authority to commit a child directly to a treatment facility. <em>See In re C.W.M., </em><a href="/a2d/407/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="407 A.2d 617" data-case-ids="7976554" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0617-01">407 A.2d 617</a> (D.C.1979) and <em>In re Myrick, </em><a href="/a2d/624/1222-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="624 A.2d 1222" data-case-ids="7368623" data-case-paths="/a2d/624/1222-01">624 A.2d 1222</a> (D.C.1993).

The trial court ruled that a juvenile could not use insanity as a defense, and this court upheld the trial court’s ruling based on the conclusion that the juvenile system adequately protects juveniles with mental illnesses. The court pointed to § 16-2320(a)(4) as an example of the court’s ability to ensure that juveniles who have been found guilty of committing crimes, and who have mental illness, receive treatment. The court stated that “[i]f, after the fact-finding hearing, the child is adjudicated a delinquent and it is determined also that he is mentally ill, the [Family Court] may as provided in D.C.Code 1973, § 16-2320(a)(4), order commitment to an appropriate facility for <a id="p911" href="#p911" data-label="911" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*911</a>medical, psychiatric, or other treatment, or direct, pursuant to § 16 — 2321(b), the appropriate authority to initiate civil commitment proceedings.” <em>C.W.M., </em><a href="/a2d/407/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="407 A.2d 617" data-case-ids="7976554" data-case-paths="/a2d/407/0617-01">407 A.2d at 624, n. 16</a>.

Therefore, neither of the above mentioned cases convinces this court that § 16-2320(a)(4) should be read in conjunction with § 16-2320(c)(2), and because the trial court committed P.S. to DHS as opposed to committing him directly to a treatment facility, § 16-2320(a)(4) is inapplicable to the present case.</p>

The District also contends that the trial court erred by giving DHS a goal, preparing P.S. for independent living, that differs from the agency's stated goal of rehabilitation. While the District is correct that rehabilitation is the goal for a public agency in delinquency cases, this court will not address this issue because the trial court did not direct DHS to perform any action pursuant to this goal.</p>

We do not mean to suggest by this opinion that the trial court has no authority to direct and supervise a juvenile's treatment regimen. Under § 16 — 2320(c)(3), the trial court always has the option of placing a child on probation if it believes that probation is in the best interest of the child and the community. If a child is placed on probation, the court may ensure through its probationary authority that the child receives the treatment the court deems is necessary.</p>
