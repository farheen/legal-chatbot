We hold that, since the reports did not satisfy the “substantial similarity” test applicable to other accident evidence, they are not admissible. Because admission of the reports was reversible error, we remand for a new trial.</p>

The accident occurred on a curved and narrowing ramp connecting New Jersey route 130 and interstate route 295, which was posted with signs advising a speed of thirty-five miles per hour and warning of a reduction to one lane. Prior to entering the ramp, Hutchinson had engaged the cruise control mechanism of the truck, setting it to sixty-two miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. After the accident, Hutchinson was trapped in the cab, the roof of which had been crushed, for approximately two hours. When rescue workers extricated him from the cab, he was flown to a trauma center, where his left arm, which had protruded from the cab, was amputated.</p>

He filed suit against Freight-liner, L.L.C., the manufacturer and seller of the truck; Penske Truck Leasing Company (Penske), which purchased the truck; Keystone Foods, Hutchinson’s employer, which had leased the truck from Penske; and McDonald’s Corporation, which had hired Keystone Foods to deliver supplies. The action was commenced by a writ of summons on February 28, 2001. The complaint, filed on July 16, 2001, contained numerous averments.</p>

Trial of the remaining two defendants began on December 1, 2003 and lasted for eighteen days. At the end of the trial, strict liability was the only claim extant.</p>
    <p id="b1016-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1016.5",1016,[223,1529,764,708]]]'>¶ 5 Hutchinson put forth two theories under his strict liability claim. First, he alleged that the cruise control system was defectively designed in two ways: it remained stuck in the on position after application of the brakes, preventing effective' braking, and there was no failsafe mechanism in place to ensure effective disengagement if the primary mechanism should fail. Second, he alleged that the structural design of the cab was defective in that it lacked sufficient crashworthiness to allow the driver to escape serious injury-after a roll-over accident.</p>

Defendants Penske and Freightliner filed post-trial motions, seeking JNOV or, in the alternative, new trial or remittitur. The trial court denied the motions for JNOV or new trial, but vacated the punitive damage award to Freightliner, finding that it was not supported by evidence of record. Plaintiff Hutchinson also filed a post-trial motion, seeking delay damages pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 238. The trial court granted this motion, thus increasing Hutchinson’s compensatory damage award to a total of $5,974,237.</p>
    <p id="b1016-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1016.8",1016,[1028,841,752,679]]]'>¶ 7 The parties filed cross-appeals.

Freightliner and Penske seek review of the order denying their motion for JNOV with respect to liability or, in the alternative, for a new trial, based primarily on allegations of improper admissions of evidence. In addition, they seek review of the trial court order that awarded delay damages.</p>

The goals of the studies were to identify the most important factors in truck occupant fatalities and to provide recommendations to improve occupant protection and survivability. Freightliner contends that these studies were improperly admitted into evidence because they did not meet the “substantial similarity” test required to admit “other accident” evidence. <em>See Valentine, supra </em>at 1163; <em>Spino, supra </em>at 735; <em>DiFrancesco, supra </em>at 535; <em>Majdic, <a href="/pa-super/370/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="370 Pa.

Trial Court Opinion, 6/25/04, at 15-16, 33. The trial court acknowledged that, because the reports did not pass the substantial similarity test, they were not admissible to prove product defect. Thus, the trial court drew a distinction between other accident evidence admitted to prove a product defect and the same evidence admitted to prove state of mind. By admitting the reports to prove state of mind, the trial court erred.</p>

Despite Hutchinson’s argument to the contrary, the “state of mind” that Hutchinson sought to prove with the expert reports was nothing more or less than Freightliner’s knowledge — or notice — of the alleged lack of crashworthiness of its cabs. Given this evidentiary purpose, the proffered reports fit squarely within the holding of <em>Spino, </em>and the “substantial similarity” test must be satisfied for them to be properly admitted into evidence, whether to prove defect, causation or knowledge/notice.</p>

For example, he contends that the expert reports do not constitute “other accident” evidence because he presented no single other accident to the jury but rather presented only the reports’ conclusions from studies of hundreds of other accidents. To suggest, as Hutchinson does, that the un<a id="p986" href="#p986" data-label="986" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*986</a>derlying nature of this evidence of other accidents was transformed, merely because it was compiled, analyzed, and summarized to generate conclusions, defies both logic and common sense.

For example, in the context of an exchange concerning the design of Freightliner’s truck and how it may have affected plaintiffs injuries, Hutchinson’s counsel quoted from the 1986 Report and then posed the following question to Mr. Koepke, who was testifying as the company’s crashworthiness expert: “My question to you is why are you ignoring the 1986 Report?” N.T. 12/15/03 p.m., at 17.

The figure shown to the jury depicted a cab-over-engine, which is a different design from the conventional cab of the FLD 120 (the model involved in the. accident), but counsel failed to mention this distinction.

The record supports the trial court’s conclusion that Hutchinson’s counsel “repeatedly, blatantly, and intentionally” violated the court’s order. Trial Court Opinion, 6/25/04, at 18.

Hutchinson repeatedly invokes <em>Cricket Lighters, supra, </em>for the proposition that a scholarly expert safety report is admissible as evidence of defendant’s state of mind, without a finding of substantial similarity between the accidents underlying the report and the accident being litigated. Such an inference is inaccurate and improper. The product at issue in <em>Cricket Lighters </em>was a butane cigarette lighter that lacked a child safety device and was used by a child to start a fatal house fire. It was undisputed that the lighter at issue was not child-resistant. An expert report, which summarized the consequences, in lost lives and monetary cost, of fires caused by children playing with cigarette lighters, was offered by the plaintiff. The applicability of the substantial similarity test to the expert report was not raised in any appellate court, so it cannot be inferred that the report was not subject to this test. In fact, the only statement on this issue suggests that substantial similarity of the products was considered: "Disposable butane lighters were involved in ninety-six percent of the fires in which the type of lighter was known.” <em>Id. </em>at 373, <a href="/pa/576/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="841 A.2d 1000" data-case-ids="16773,9286806" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0644-01,/a2d/841/1000-01">841 A.2d 1000</a>. We agree with Hutchinson that Pennsylvania courts do not require that "other accident” evidence involve only products from the same manufacturer as the product at issue. <em>See DiFrancesco, supra </em>at 537. However, the court must give "thoughtful consideration” to the similarities — and to any differences — between the products involved in other accidents and the product at issue. <em>Id. </em>Only if the court finds substantial similarity, not only with respect to the products but also with respect to the circumstances surrounding the accidents, is the evidence of other accidents properly admitted. <em>See Valentine, supra </em>at 1163; <em>Spino, supra </em>at 735; <em>DiFrancesco, supra </em>at 535; <em>Majdic, <a href="/pa-super/370/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="370 Pa.
