Chemically, it is a carbohydrate of the general formula (CoHioOs)n, but little is known as to its structure except that it is exceedingly complex. Certain of the hydrogen atoms in the cellulose molecule are hydroxyl hydrogens and can be replaced by acid radicals such as the nitrate group and the acetate group, forming corresponding esters. If replaced by an alkyl or aryl radical, there is formed an ether, the ether being of a low or high degree of etherification, depending on the number of hydroxyl hydrogens which have been replaced. In the preparation of these compounds, the usual procedure is to form an alkali cellulose by treating cellulose with caustic soda, subjecting the alkali cellulose thus produced to the action of the appropriate reagents.</blockquote>
