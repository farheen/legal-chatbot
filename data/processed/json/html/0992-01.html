The initiative in question, entitled “The Prohibition of Horse-Drawn Carriages Act of 1990,” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> would be placed on the ballot in a special election to be held on November 5, 1991. Petitioner is the owner and operator of a horse-drawn carriage business, apparently the only one of its kind still operating in the District. She contends that in counting signatures submitted in support of the initiative, the Board counted some 2,348 signatures of persons whose addresses listed on the petition forms correspond to no address of the same-named person on the voter registration rolls;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that this number of purportedly invalid signatures was enough to alter the outcome of the process of certifying the initiative;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that the Board justified its counting of the disputed 2,348 signatures by incorrectly reading this court’s decision in <em>Harvey v.

It requires the Board to “post, by making available for public inspection, petitions for initiatives or referenda, or facsimiles thereof, in the office of the Board, for 10 days ... beginning on the 3rd day after the petitions are filed.” It further provides: “[a]ny qualified elector may, <em>within such 10-day period, </em>challenge the validity of any petition, by a <em>written </em>statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in such petition” (emphasis added). Section 1-1320(o) goes on to provide that “[t]he provisions of § l-1312(o)(2) shall be applicable to such challenge.” That section states that “[t]he Board shall receive evidence in support of and in opposition to the challenge and shall determine the validity of the challenged ... petition not more than 15 days after the challenge has been filed.” Lastly, “[wjithin 3 days after announcement of the determination of the Board with respect to the validity of the ... petition,” the challenger “may apply to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for a review of the reasonableness of such determination.”</p>

Except only for those facial or subject matter defects in the petition which the Board must notice on its own before accepting a petition as filed, § l-1320(k)(l), none of which is relevant here, a written challenge to an accepted petition must be made within the 10-day period following the posting specified in § l-1320(o). The Board must then receive evidence (if any) respecting the challenge <a id="p995" href="#p995" data-label="995" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*995</a>and determine the validity of the “challenged petition” within the next 15 days, and the challenger may apply for review of that determination by this court within 3 days. In all events, the Board must certify the validity of the petition and accompanying signatures within 30 calendar days of acceptance. Section l-1320(o) further authorizes the Board to “issue supplemental rules concerning the challenge of such petitions,” and the rules the Board has promulgated reinforce the intent of the statutory framers to insure resolution of all challenges to petitions in the prescribed manner.

Petitioner acknowledges that only at the public hearing which the Board held on June 27, 1991, the thirtieth day after filing, to certify the petition, did she orally contest the Board’s decision to count the 2,348 signatures. Petitioner also does not appear to dispute that <em>some, </em>or indeed most, challenges to initiative petitions must be brought in the manner specified by § 1-1320(o), but contends that hers was not one of them. Specifically, she asserts that challenges to the validity of <em>particular </em>initiative petitions, or particular signatures on petitions, must be made in the manner prescribed but that her challenge is different: while “not challenging the validity of any particular petition filed by the proponents of [the present] Initiative,” “she is challenging the decision of the Board to ignore the legal requirement that only the signatures of registered qualified electors be counted towards the number needed to qualify the Initiative.” In other words, petitioner maintains that until the June 27 public hearing, she had no challenge to bring — her challenge would have been “unripe” — because until then she could reasonably expect the Board, without challenge by anyone, to reject signatures of persons whose petition addresses did not match the Board’s voting rolls, and only then did the Board declare its erroneous reliance on <em>Harvey, supra, </em>as requiring that petition signatures that match signatures on the rolls be counted without regard to matching addresses.</p>

We do not see how it can be disputed that petitioner is challenging the validity of a particular initiative petition and of particular signatures — indeed, of as many as 2,348 signatures. Petitioner’s argument is that those signatures could not lawfully be counted by the Board because the absence of a registration address matching the address for the same person on the petition (and further absent proof of registration at a changed address since signing the petition) means that the signers are not “registered qualified electors” under § l-1320(o). Whether or not petitioner relied on the Board’s past practice to assume it would agree with this principle and reject the signatures did not alter her obligation to challenge the signatures in accordance with the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Had petitioner done so, at <a id="p996" href="#p996" data-label="996" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*996</a>least two things might have happened in keeping with the statutory goal of timely dispute resolution at the agency level. The Board, met with a concrete challenge to the lack of correspondence between addresses, might have retreated from the rule petitioner says it erroneously derived from <em>Harvey </em>or at least, as a precaution against later correction of its legal understanding by this court, might have required the proposer to establish the actual current registration of a portion of the disputed signatories.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Even without Board insistence, the proposer of the initiative might have undertaken to prove the validity of these signatures and so moot the correctness <em>vel non </em>of the Board’s decision to ignore the mismatch in addresses. Consequently, the issue of signatures might have been resolved to the satisfaction of everyone by the expiration of the statutory thirty days. Instead, nearly three months after the Board’s hearing and with the election approaching, petitioner now asks this court to remand to the Board and require the showing of actual current registration that could have been accomplished within the regulatory framework. That seems to us an object lesson in a key principle underlying exhaustion of remedies, that “recourse to the administrative process may afford complete relief and thus eliminate the need for any judicial involvement.” <em>Hawkins v.

We need not decide whether the public hearing at which petitioner challenged the initiative met the “contested case” requirement of our APA jurisdiction, though that seems doubtful. <em>See, e.g., Jones &amp; Artis Constr.

The Initiative Procedures Act itself establishes the manner by which review of a determination of the validity of a circulated initiative may be sought in this court. D.C.Code § l-1320(o), incorporating § l-1312(o )(2). That avenue is available upon the timely filing of a written challenge to an initiative, followed by a determination of validity by the Board within 15 days. We hold that this procedure, and not the APA, provides the basis for this court’s jurisdiction to review challenges to initiative petitions cognizable under § l-1320(o).
