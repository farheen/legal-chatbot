It held that Metal Industries did not have a duty to manufacture a screen that would have prevented Shayne from falling out of the window. It also concluded that neither the vent-stop feature of the window nor the warning label on the screen gave rise to a duty that would otherwise not have existed. The Superior Court further held that, even assuming the existence of a manufacturing defect, there was no basis for sub<a id="p943" href="#p943" data-label="943" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*943</a>mitting the issue of proximate cause to a trier of fact.</p>

Second, Brower submits the Superior Court incorrectly held that the warning label and vent-stop features of the Metal Industries’ window did not create a duty.

    <p id="b1007-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.7",1007,[196,1772,752,557]]]'>On September 9,1992, Shayne fell out of a second story window in the home of Bernadette Townsend (“Townsend”), his aunt. Shayne sustained numerous injuries. At the time, Shayne was eleven months old, 28 3/4 inches tall, and weighed twenty pounds. Shayne could crawl but had not yet started walking at the time of his fall. The window that Shayne fell from was located approximately 16 5/8 inches from the floor. The window is 64 inches high and 32 7/8 inches wide.</p>
    <p id="b1007-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.8",1007,[197,2372,751,371]],["BL_1007.9",1007,[995,230,754,86]]]'>Just prior to his fall, Shayne was upstairs in a bedroom with his twin brother Wayne, and four of his cousins, all children of Townsend: Robert (“Robert”), age 8-9; Amber (“Amber”), age 8; Chappelle (“Chappelle”), age 5; and Khare (“Khare”), age 1. Although Townsend was downstairs unpacking groceries when Shayne fell, she had made three trips up the stairs to check on the children within a span of ten minutes.</p>
    <p id="b1007-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.10",1007,[995,343,757,323]]]'>Shortly before Shayne’s fall, Robert had opened the upstairs bedroom window to talk with a friend. Amber told Townsend that Robert was at the window. Townsend told Robert to move away from the window. Robert then went down the stairs and out of the house into the front yard.</p>
    <p id="b1007-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.11",1007,[996,693,756,424]]]'>Amber was in the room at the time of Shayne’s fall. Amber testified that she did not know how Shayne fell. Robert was also unable to provide any information as to how Shayne fell. Chappelle and Khare were too young to be deposed. Townsend was at the bottom of the staircase, proceeding to check on the children again, when she heard a voice say “the baby fell.”</p>
    <p id="b1007-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.12",1007,[995,1143,755,509]]]'>When Shayne fell, the entire screen fell out of the window. Townsend had never experienced a problem with the screen prior to the date of the fall, had never removed the screen, nor put it up or down. From the time Townsend had moved in the home in June until Shayne’s fall in September, the screen had remained where it was in the window. The day after the accident, metal clips were installed on the outside of the screen.</p>
    <p id="b1007-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.13",1007,[995,1685,753,507]]]'>The screen was designed to fit inside the window frame, with two tension springs on the left side. When those springs were depressed, the right side of the window could be moved to or from the window channel. The window was designed with a vent-stop feature which, when activated by someone depressing inward and lifting upward, would prevent the window from being raised to its full height. Townsend was unaware of this feature.</p>
    <p id="b1007-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1007.14",1007,[995,2226,756,509]]]'>The screen had a warning label on the bottom edge of the screen. The warning states that screens are not intended to keep people or objects in. There is a dispute as to whether the entire warning was visible. It is undisputed, however, that the word “warning” was visible. Townsend acknowledged that she was aware of the danger of children falling out of windows. Robert and Amber knew that they were not supposed to open the window.</p>

      <a id="p944" href="#p944" data-label="944" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*944</a>The record reflects that a window screen consists of the frame, the spline, and the wire mesh. Metal Industries tests the screens it manufactures to see how much pressure it would take to push the spline and mesh out of the frame. The tests demonstrate that it takes forty pounds of force to separate the mesh and spline from the frame. The test is not done with the screen in the window. No test is performed to determine how much force is necessary to detach the entire screen from the window.</p>
    <p id="b1008-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.4",1008,[183,816,758,652]]]'>Harry L. Miller (“Miller”), Screen Manager for Metal Industries, visited the Townsend home after Shayne’s fall to inspect the window and screen. He noted that the screen seemed loose in the window. The window frame appeared “bowed” in the center. When measured, the window was wider in the middle than at the top and bottom. There is no way to determine if the variation in the window’s width was the result of manufacture as opposed to installation. Miller acknowledged that it was “possible” that this condition could cause the screen to fall or blow out of the window.</p>

Brower asserts that she is not advocating “a higher standard or a duty to design a child-proof screen.” According to Brower, Metal Industries had a duty to “manufacture a window and screen consistent with existing standards, suitable for ordinary, foreseeable use, free from manufacturing defects,” and thus “avoiding-foreseeable risks of harm, particularly to small children .” The crux of Brower’s argument is that had the window been manufactured properly, <em>as designed, </em>Shayne would not have fallen out the window. According to Brower, the window, as designed, would have withstood any pressure that the twenty pound infant could have created. Thus, Brower submits, if the screen had been properly manufactured to fit within the window for its intended purpose, then no matter what occurred to create the circumstances of Shayne’s fall, the amount of pressure would not have been enough to dislodge a nondefective screen from the window.</p>
    <p id="b1008-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1008.8",1008,[989,381,754,607]]]'>Metal Industries argues the ordinary purpose of its window screens are to keep insects out while letting in light and air but not to serve as a restraint for either children or adults. Metal Industries submits that manufacturers of window screens “have never been found to have a duty to design and manufacture” a window screen that “will prevent people from falling from windows.” The Superior Court agreed and held that Metal Industries did not have a duty to manufacture a screen that would be a “security device to keep people in.”</p>

App. Ct. 911" data-case-ids="5741742" data-case-paths="/mass-app-ct/16/0911-01">16 Mass.App.Ct. 911</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=449%20N.E.2d%201229" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="449 N.E.2d 1229">449 N.E.2d 1229</a>, 1231 (1983) <em>quoting </em>2 Harper and James, <em>Torts </em>§ 28.7, at 1547 (1956). Townsend, the adult who was watching Shayne, acknowledged her awareness of the danger that a child might fall through an open window.</p>
    <p id="b1010-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1010.5",1010,[991,205,757,949]]]'>Finally, Brower argues that, assuming the window was defective, there was a material factual dispute in the record about whether that defect was a proximate cause of Shayne’s fall. It is well-established that summary judgment may be entered only when the moving party establishes the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Ebersole v. Lowengrub, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20467" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="180 A.2d 467">180 A.2d 467</a>, 469 (1962). It is also true that issues of proximate cause are <em>normally </em>questions of fact for the jury. <em><a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20467" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="180 A.2d 467">Id.</a> </em>Metal Industries’ factual argument fails because, as a matter of law, there was no duty owed by Metal Industries to manufacture a screen that would function as a child restraint to have prevented Shayne’s fall. Therefore, in the absence of a legal duty, the Superior Court properly concluded there was no issue of material fact to submit to a jury.</p>

Suit was originally brought by Wayne Townsend, Sr. and Sharen Taylor, individually and as guardians for Shayne. Mr. Townsend and Ms. Taylor are Shayne’s parents. On April 3, 1995, the complaint was amended to add the manufacturer of the window, Metal Industries, as a defendant. Brower was substituted as Shayne's guardian <em>ad litem </em>on August 6, 1996.</p>
