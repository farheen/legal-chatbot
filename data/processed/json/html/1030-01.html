If this is the case, then the public will expect the likelihood of justice at the hands of their judges and will accede to judicial authority. On the other hand, if a judicial officer conducts himself — on or off the bench — no better than the lowlifes and hoodlums who sometimes pass through his court then the public’s confidence in the judiciary will be diminished and its authority threatened. Such is the consequence of this Respondent’s conduct.</p>
    <p id="b1083-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1083.10",1083,[931,586,756,769]]]'>We are disposed to address one further point. The Stipulated Findings of Fact in this case include one (No. 19) which recites that the events which are the subject of this Complaint “received media publicity” and were “reported in newspapers which have tens of thousands of subscribers.” In addition, the Board attached several newspaper articles as Exhibits to the Complaint in this case and has attached to its Suggested Conclusions of Law a copy of an editorial which appeared in the <em>Lancaster Intelligencer Journal </em>presumably to illustrate widespread coverage of Respondent’s conduct at the golf club.</p>

We do not attach any probative weight to allegations that media coverage of a particular occurrence was heavy — or that it was covered at all. In no case has this Court referred to media coverage, or the extent of it, in determining whether particular conduct was such that brought the judicial office itself into disrepute and, thus, was a violation of the Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> To do so would be to bestow upon the media a role in determining what is a violation of the Constitution. To <a id="p1036" href="#p1036" data-label="1036" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1036</a>do so would be to give attention to considerations incompatible, even antagonistic, to the constitutional instructions we must heed. The media prints, or broadcasts, what it considers is important for the public to know, what it considers the public will be interested in, i.e., what it considers will sell newspapers or attract listeners or viewers. These may well be legitimate considerations for the successful operation of a print or electronic media business, but, they have no place in the business of this Court.</p>

Simply put, it is the members of this Court who have been appointed, pursuant to the Constitution, by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and by the Governor of Pennsylvania, to determine those cases where conduct is so extreme as to bring the judicial office itself into disrepute — not the representatives of the media.</p>
