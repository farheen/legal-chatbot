Appellant told Kenya, that he was in the basement looking for his keys, and that S.P. was “in the laundry room,” which was also in the basement. Kenya observed S.P. in the laundry room “wiping something off her shirt.” When Kenya asked what had happened, S.P. at first avoided answering, but eventually told Kenya when the two were alone in an upstairs bedroom that appellant had been “on top of her and moving around.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> S.P. was crying during this exchange.</p>

Schunrear heard S.P. say that appellant “did something to her, touched her, or something of that nature-” When Teeka asked S.P.' if she was sure, S.P. said “yes, and ... it has been happening since [the family lived at] 601.” “601” apparently refers to the family’s prior address, which, according to S.P.’s trial testimony, was “6012 46th Place.” The trial court admitted this statement only to show the context of S.P.’s report to her family on July 6, and the jury was instructed that it could consider the statement only for that purpose.</p>

Dr. Luttman also opined that, because the DNA profile found in those stains was so uncommon, appellant was the source of the DNA to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. That opinion was based on Dr. Luttman’s calculations of the extremely low statistical probability <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>that the DNA profile found in the evidence stains would be found in an unrelated individual chosen at random from major population groups. Further, the examiner also said that there was one intact sperm cell on the slide with one of the vaginal smears obtained by the sexual assault nurse at the time S.P. was examined at Children’s Hospital. Dr. Luttman testified, however, that no DNA testing was done on that sperm cell, because one sperm cell in “an ocean of cells from the vagina ... is not going to give [DNA] results.”</p>

Dr. Woodward testified that the swelling, and the “abrasion at eleven o’clock” outlined in the medical records from July 7 “would suggest that there had been acute genital contact and trauma.” Because abrasions to mu-cosal surfaces like that of the vagina usually heal rapidly, Dr. Woodward opined that the abrasion seen on July 7 was “something relatively recent, and certainly not older than probably three days.”</p>

The fact that the edges were worn smooth also was consistent with vaginal penetration, the most likely source being “penile vaginal intercourse.”</p>

United States, </em><a href="/a2d/398/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="398 A.2d 354" data-case-ids="7977143" data-case-paths="/a2d/398/0354-01">398 A.2d 354</a>, 364 (D.C.1979). In this case the trial court had a firm and accurate command of the long history of continuances and delays, of the many opportunities given appellant in open court to choose independent DNA testing, and of the eleventh-hour nature of the request for continuance of the eleventh trial date. Although the trial judge mistakenly believed that appellant and/or his counsel had specifically waived independent DNA testing (an “eminently understandable” misunderstanding in the words of appellant’s counsel), it based its denial of a further delay on the reasonable conclusion that appellant was engaging in an attempt to avoid or delay trial. It is clear beyond doubt that Veney knew from the judge’s prior statements in open court that he was able to have independent DNA testing if he chose to do so. He knew of the potential evidentiary value of such testing from the advice the judge gave his fellow defendant, Roberts, in open court in Veney’s presence. At a very early stage of the proceedings, he heard his own attorney tell the judge that appellant was considering retaining his own expert to evaluate the DNA evidence. Later, he heard the trial judge ask his attorney in open court whether they had made any effort to get independent DNA testing. During argument on the <em>Frye </em>motion, he had heard the trial judge discuss in open court the importance of independent DNA testing and ask his counsel why he had not yet chosen to secure retesting since it might support this motion to exclude DNA evidence.</p>

Rather, appellant argues that he should be put in the position he would have been before trial if the trial judge had engaged Veney in a colloquy concerning DNA testing before jury selection. He “respectfully submits that he should not be made to meet the specific and potentially more stringent provisions of D.C.Code § 22-4133” governing post-conviction testing. These provisions require, <em>inter alia, </em>the submission of an affidavit by appellant, under penalty of perjury, stating that he is “actually innocent of the crime” charged and a statement of the reason the requested DNA testing was not previously obtained. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-4133(b).</p>

We can accept the trial court’s conclusion, based on the extraordinary record before us, that Veney’s failure to seek pre-trial testing was knowing and intelligent. We decline to take the further step of concluding that he made a fully voluntary waiver of such testing, because that conclusion cannot be reached on this record. A suitable colloquy in open court, as contemplated by the statute, one that included a statement by Veney himself that he requested or waived independent DNA testing, would have eliminated any question of voluntariness. But such a colloquy did not take place. Appellant, we hold, is therefore free to proceed with a motion for post-conviction testing under § 22-4133, and is not rendered ineligible to proceed under § 22-4133 by application of § 22-4132(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

Appellant, citing D.C.Code § 22-4132(b)(3), asserts in his supplemental brief that the "IPA ... states that a trial judge <em>shall </em>inform the defendant that he has the absolute right to obtain or forego independent DNA testing and of the consequences of exercising or waiving this right.” Even overlooking, for the time being, appellant’s unsustainable assertion that the IPA provides an "absolute right” to independent DNA testing — as opposed to merely a right to <em>request </em>such testing, <em>see infra, </em>we note that the statute does not require that the trial judge himself or herself must impart the specified advice. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-4132(a). This statute may be distinguished from D.C.Code § 23-111 (2001). Pursuant to the latter statute, the trial judge, himself or herself, is required to ask the defendant "whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information,” and must further inform the defendant “that any challenge to a previous conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.” D.C.Code § 23-111(b); <em>see also </em>D.C.Code § 16-713(a) (2001) (trial court “shall administer” specified advisement regarding potential immigration consequences before accepting plea of guilty from alien defendant).</p>

Appellant makes the point that the government did not argue during trial that the statute, correctly construed, gives a defendant only the opportunity to <em>request </em>independent DNA testing, not a <em>right </em>to independent DNA testing. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 22-4132. However, the matter of "right” versus "request” was not discussed by either party before the trial court, because the trial judge did not base his ruling upon statutory construction.</p>
