This portion of the property abutted Route 611. The Corps directed Landowners to cease all development of the wetlands portion.

It did find credible, however, the testimony of the Landowners’ expert witness, Thomas Schatzman. (See Appellant’s Brief, Exhibit “A” at 11.) Mr. Schatz-man testified as to the value of the property based on comparable sales and valued both the wetlands and non-wetlands portions of the property at $1,000.00 per acre actual, $250.00 assessed.

He acknowledged that had these four acres not been wet, they would be worth more. He also gave the same actual and assessed value to the remaining 3.64 acres of this parcel that are upland or dry acres. Mr. Schatzman based his appraisal on the fact that without a permit to use a portion of the front wetlands to gain access to the rear 3.64 acres, this rear section of the parcel would be rendered landlocked and useless to [Landowners]. Mr. Schatzman considered the fact that the land located adjacent to the rear of this parcel was owned by the [Landowners’] family; however, since it was determined that the [Landowners] did not maintain an ownership interest in the adjacent property, it could not be said that an alternate access to this section of the parcel was available. Mr. Schatzman opined that if at some point in the future access to the rear 3.64 acres could be obtained via a permit to traverse the wet area, the value of the rear portion of this parcel would increase.</blockquote>
