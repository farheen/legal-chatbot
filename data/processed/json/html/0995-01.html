    <p id="b1055-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.6",1055,[194,835,749,612]]]'>This is an appeal by the defendant, Claus von Bulow, from a Superior Court conviction on two counts of attempting to murder his wife, Martha von Bulow. The indictment was handed down by a Newport County grand jury on July 6, 1981, charging the defendant with two separate counts of assault with intent to murder his wife. The trial commenced in Newport on February 2, 1982, before a justice of the Superior Court and a jury. On March 16,1982, after six days of deliberation, the jury found the defendant guilty on both counts.</p>
    <p id="b1055-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.7",1055,[194,1469,749,557]]]'>The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial. These motions were denied by the trial justice on March 17 and April 2, 1982, respectively. On May 7, 1982, defendant was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institution on the first count and twenty years at the Adult Correctional Institution on the second count, these sentences to be served consecutively. The defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction entered below.</p>
    <p id="b1055-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.8",1055,[194,2055,749,460]]]'>After a trial spanning six weeks, the record of which includes more than 5200 pages of transcript embodied in twenty-six volumes, Claus von Bulow was found guilty of twice attempting to murder his wife by injecting her with doses of insulin. There were no eyewitnesses to these alleged crimes. Rather, the jury found defendant guilty on the basis of circumstantial evidence.</p>
    <p id="b1055-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.9",1055,[195,2545,750,133]],["BL_1055.10",1055,[994,274,750,641]]]'>On December 21, 1980, Martha von Bu-low was found in a comatose state on her bathroom floor in the family’s Newport home — Clarendon Court. She remains in that condition at a New York hospital. Approximately one year earlier, she suffered a similar episode of unconsciousness from which she quickly recovered. The occurrence of the second coma triggered the events leading up to defendant’s indictment, trial, and conviction. Suspecting that defendant may have poisoned his wife, Martha von Bulow’s son, Alex; her daughter Ala; and her mother, Mrs. Aitken, hired former Manhattan District Attorney Richard Kuh to investigate the cause of Mrs. von Bulow’s condition.</p>
    <p id="b1055-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.11",1055,[995,945,749,222]]]'>Chronologically, the events that gave rise to the family’s suspicion and culminated in its investigation of defendant’s possible criminal involvement are essentially as follows.</p>
    <p id="b1055-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.12",1055,[995,1196,750,937]]]'>On December 27, 1979, Martha von Bu-low suffered her first coma. On the previous evening, she became weak and uncoordinated and had to be helped to her bedroom by her son Alex. Maria Schrallham-mer, Martha von Bulow's personal maid, testified that shortly after nine thirty on the morning of December 27, 1979, she heard Mrs. von Bulow moaning in her bedroom. Upon entering the room, she unsuccessfully attempted to arouse Mrs. von Bu-low. Alarmed, she asked defendant to call a doctor, which he refused to do at that time. The defendant did call a doctor, however, at approximately two o’clock that afternoon. The doctor was not in, and defendant left a message. The doctor returned the call about an hour later and defendant relayed to him several of his wife’s symptoms.</p>
    <p id="b1055-13" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.13",1055,[995,2154,751,369]]]'>In this regard, Maria testified that the description of Mrs. von Bulow’s condition given by defendant to the doctor was untrue. Specifically, Maria testified that defendant’s statements that Mrs. von Bulow had an alcoholic problem and that she had been drinking the night before and had been out of bed that morning were untrue.</p>
    <p id="b1055-14" data-blocks='[["BL_1055.14",1055,[996,2545,751,125]],["BL_1056.1",1056,[231,287,754,812]]]'>At approximately six o’clock that evening, Martha von Bulow’s condition worsened. The defendant called the doctor and <a id="p1000" href="#p1000" data-label="1000" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1000</a>conveyed to him the severity of her condition. Upon the doctor’s arrival, Mrs. von Bulow vomited, began gasping for breath, stopped breathing, and experienced cardiac arrest. The doctor successfully resuscitated her and later testified that she had become comatose a few minutes prior to his arrival. Mrs. von Bulow was transported to Newport Hospital. Blood tests indicated that her blood-sugar level was unusually low. Mrs. von Bulow regained consciousness, recovered, and was discharged on January 2, 1980, with a diagnosis of “broncho-pneumonia * * * cardio-respirato-ry arrest due to massive aspiration of gastric contents * * * hypoglycemia of undetermined etiology.”</p>
    <p id="b1056-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.4",1056,[227,1125,755,1057]]]'>Maria Schrallhammer further testified that in February 1980 she found something in the von Bulows’ New York apartment which disturbed her. While cleaning a walk-in closet off defendant’s bedroom, she noticed a large black traveling bag belonging to defendant. Upon looking inside this bag, she discovered a smaller black bag or pouch (hereinafter referred to as the black bag). Maria removed the black bag, opened it, and examined its contents. Inside the black bag she found three vials— one containing pills, one containing powder, and one containing liquid. She then replaced the black bag and its contents inside the larger traveling bag. Some days or weeks later, Maria returned to the traveling bag, removed the black bag, and again examined its contents. On this occasion she wrote down the information contained on the labels of each vial on three separate pieces of paper.</p>
    <p id="b1056-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.5",1056,[227,2208,754,478]],["BL_1056.6",1056,[1039,286,743,85]]]'>In November 1980, around Thanksgiving, Maria once again noticed the black bag— this time she found it inside a white canvas bag located on a chair in defendant’s bedroom. She again examined the contents of the bag. In addition to the three vials that she had seen previously, she stated that it now contained two or three needles, a syringe, and a small bottle labeled “insulin.” Shortly thereafter, she called Alex into the room and showed him the contents of the black bag.</p>
    <p id="b1056-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.7",1056,[1034,392,749,640]]]'>On December 19, 1980, Mr. and Mrs. von Bulow, along with defendant’s daughter, Cosima, left New York and traveled to their Newport home where they were met by Alex. Maria testified that on that date she again saw the black bag inside the white canvas bag. She again examined the contents of the bag and found it to be substantially the same as it was in November. Once again she replaced the bag where she had found it and carried the white canvas bag to the elevator to be brought down to the family car for the trip to Rhode Island.</p>
    <p id="b1056-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.8",1056,[1032,1061,748,597]]]'>On the evening of December 20, 1980, defendant, Mrs. von Bulow, Alex, and Cosi-ma were driven by the family chauffeur to a local cinema. The family was driven back to Clarendon Court after the movie. Upon their return, Alex accompanied his mother to her bedroom, where they spoke briefly. Martha von Bulow subsequently went into the bathroom, and Alex adjourned to the library. A short time later Mrs. von Bulow joined her son in the library where they continued their conversation.</p>
    <p id="b1056-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.9",1056,[1033,1686,745,221]]]'>At some point during the conversation, defendant entered the library and asked his wife if there was anything that she needed. She asked him to bring her some soup, which he did.</p>
    <p id="b1056-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1056.10",1056,[1033,1933,747,751]],["BL_1057.1",1057,[204,273,750,172]]]'>Alex testified that after about an hour of conversation he noticed that his mother was experiencing symptoms of weakness and lack of coordination similar to those he had observed the previous December. When she experienced difficulty standing, Alex carried her to her bedroom. Alex then went to his stepfather’s study and informed defendant that Mrs. von Bulow was feeling weak. Immediately thereafter, Alex returned to his mother’s bedroom. Approximately five minutes later, Mrs. von Bulow emerged from her bathroom and walked to her bed. Alex helped his mother into bed as she was apparently still feeling very weak. A few minutes later, according <a id="p1001" href="#p1001" data-label="1001" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1001</a>to Alex’s testimony, defendant came into the bedroom. Shortly thereafter, Alex left his mother and defendant alone in the bedroom.</p>
    <p id="b1057-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.4",1057,[204,475,750,1329]]]'>Alex testified further that on the following morning, December 21, 1980, he awoke at approximately eleven o’clock. While dressing and before going downstairs to breakfast, he looked out his window and observed defendant walking back to the house from the ocean. Alex then went downstairs to the dining room. At some point defendant came into the hallway, and Alex asked him whether his mother had gotten out of bed yet. The defendant appeared surprised to hear that his wife might still be in bed and walked toward her room. Alex testified that some ten or fifteen minutes later, defendant returned to the hallway near the dining room and motioned for him to come. Alex followed defendant to his mother’s bedroom. Upon entering the room, he walked into the bathroom and discovered his mother lying unconscious on the floor. Alex testified that defendant placed his finger under his wife’s nose and determined that she was still breathing. The defendant then left the room, apparently to call a doctor or the rescue squad. A few minutes later, paramedics responded, and Martha von Bulow was taken to Newport Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b1057-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.5",1057,[205,1825,750,850]],["BL_1057.6",1057,[1007,273,748,85]]]'>On December 22, 1980, Martha von Bu-low was moved to Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. She was later transferred to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. During the period of time in which she was at the Boston Hospital (approximately three weeks), defendant and Alex alternately traveled to Boston for several days at a time to stay with Mrs. von Bulow. Alex testified that shortly after his mother had been transferred to Boston, he went into defendant’s closet at Clarendon Court to look for the black bag. He did not find the bag on that occasion. Several days later, on December 27 or 28, 1980, he again attempted to enter defendant’s closet for the purpose of locating the black bag. On this occasion, however, the closet was locked and he made no further effort to gain entry.</p>
    <p id="b1057-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.7",1057,[1005,379,750,515]]]'>Alex later discussed his suspicions regarding defendant with Maria; his sister, Ala; and his grandmother, Mrs. Aitken. Alex, Ala, and Mrs. Aitken subsequently discussed the possibility of hiring an attorney to look into the causes behind Martha von Bulow’s condition. The family’s financial advisor, Morris Gurley, was asked to recommend such an attorney. Gurley suggested the name of former Manhattan District Attorney Richard Kuh.</p>
    <p id="b1057-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.8",1057,[1005,916,752,517]]]'>Sometime in early January 1981, Alex and Ala met with Kuh for the first time. The meeting lasted approximately one to one and a half hours. Alex testified that he and Ala discussed with Kuh their suspicions regarding defendant’s conduct during those periods surrounding their mother’s two comas. Alex testified further that between the time of this first meeting and January 23, 1981, there were at least six more meetings with Kuh.</p>
    <p id="b1057-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.9",1057,[1005,1455,751,324]]]'>Several days prior to January 23, 1981, Alex told Kuh about his previous attempts to locate the black bag in defendant’s closet at Clarendon Court. It was apparently then decided that Alex would go back to Newport to look, once again, for the black bag.</p>
    <p id="b1057-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.10",1057,[1006,1801,750,324]]]'>On the afternoon of January 23, 1981, Alex drove from New York City to Rhode Island with a Mr. Edwin Lambert, a private investigator hired through Kuh. Alex and Lambert first went to Providence to engage a locksmith and then traveled on to Newport.</p>
    <p id="b1057-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.11",1057,[1006,2147,751,365]]]'>Once at Clarendon Court, Alex, Lambert, and the locksmith went to defendant’s study. Alex obtained a set of keys from defendant’s desk. The locksmith examined the keys and identified which key would fit the lock to defendant’s closet. The door was opened, and the locksmith was dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b1057-12" data-blocks='[["BL_1057.12",1057,[1007,2541,749,134]],["BL_1058.1",1058,[221,277,747,227]]]'>Prior to searching the closet, Alex and Lambert searched the bathroom in defendant’s study and the study itself. Nothing <a id="p1002" href="#p1002" data-label="1002" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1002</a>unusual was found in the bathroom. In the study — in defendant’s desk — Alex found a vial with French wording upon which he believed the word “Valium” was printed.</p>
    <p id="b1058-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.4",1058,[224,525,744,452]]]'>Once the search of the study was completed, Alex and Lambert entered defendant’s closet. Alex initially went through some of defendant’s clothes — patting the pockets — and discovered another vial similar to the one he had discovered in the desk. Alex testified that one of these two vials contained a powdered substance; however, he could not later be sure which one it was.</p>
    <p id="b1058-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.5",1058,[223,1006,742,747]]]'>At some point during the search of defendant’s closet, Lambert discovered a metal box. This metal box contained a small black bag that Alex recognized as being similar to the one he had seen before. Alex testified that the bag contained a prescription vial with different types of pills in it and another vial in which there was a light blue liquid. The black bag also contained two packets of ampules in plastic packaging, a syringe, and three hypodermic needles, one of which was unsealed. Inside the metal box, next to the black bag, Alex and Lambert also found a small cardboard box labeled “lidoeaine” and containing an ampule and a syringe.</p>
    <p id="b1058-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.6",1058,[218,1773,746,603]]]'>Upon completing the search of defendant’s study and closet, Alex looked through his mother’s room. He took pills from various containers found in the room and a vial of Inderal from the night table. When the entire search was completed, Alex placed all the items found (with the possible exception of the lidoeaine) into the black bag and transported it all back to New York. Alex testified that the lido-caine may not have fit into the black bag but was included with the items that he transported to New York.</p>
    <p id="b1058-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.7",1058,[217,2398,748,273]],["BL_1058.8",1058,[1022,276,744,129]]]'>Upon his return to New York, Alex initially went to his sister’s apartment. He was then accompanied by Kuh to the office of Kuh’s brother, a doctor, where the contents of the black bag were removed and examined. After the items had been examined, Alex returned them to his sister’s apartment and placed them in a safe in her closet.</p>
    <p id="b1058-9" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.9",1058,[1018,441,749,526]]]'>At some point during the next few days Alex removed the bag from the safe and prepared samples of some of the items to give them to the family physician, Dr. Richard Stock. Alex testified that the unsealed hypodermic needle, a sample of the blue liquid, and a sample of speckled white powder from one of the French vials of Valium were sent to Dr. Stock for testing. Doctor Stock sent these items to the Bio-Science Laboratory in Great Neck, Long Island.</p>

Gambardella, director of the Bio-Science Laboratory in Great Neck, testified that he rinsed the needle with a saline solution and split the resultant washing into two separate specimens. He sent one of these specimens to Dr. J. George Nitis, director of the Bio-Science Laboratory branch in Columbia, Maryland, for a test to determine the presence of insulin. The other specimen was sent to Dr. V.J. Aggarwall, assistant director of the Boston Medical Laboratory, another branch of Bio-Science, for chemical testing to determine the presence and identity of other drugs. Doctor Gambardella also sent the white powder and the liquid to Dr. Aggarwall.</p>
    <p id="b1058-11" data-blocks='[["BL_1058.11",1058,[1018,1841,748,479]]]'>Doctor Nitis testified that the tests performed at his laboratory revealed the presence of insulin in the needle washing.

Attorney Kuh and a Detective Joseph Miranda were also present. Alex removed the items from the black bag, and Lieutenant Reise initialed and dated them. Lieutenant Reise prepared a seizure report and placed the items in the evidence room. On March 20, 1981, Lieutenant Reise removed certain of these items from the evidence room and sent them to the state toxicologist for testing. These items included five pills; one clear-glass ampule bearing the name “papaveretum”; one Valium, two milligram, vial containing a white powder; one pill container with a white cap and amber base, believed to contain Valium and possible unknown barbiturates; and one clear-glass ampule with a yellow cap and a blue interior stopper, bearing the name “lidocaine.” On April 23, 1981, Detective Miranda, under the direction of Lieutenant Reise, sent an additional pill to the state toxicology laboratory for testing. This substance was later identified by Detective Miranda as one blue pill of Valium Roehe-10.</p>

The rulings pertinent to these issues were first made at that hearing. We are of the opinion that defendant’s claim of private prosecution was utterly without merit. We do not believe that this claim requires either discussion or extended analysis. Consequently, we also recognize that rulings of admission or exclusion of evidence insofar as they relate solely to the claim of private prosecution would be non-prejudicial in their effect. However, these rulings in relation to attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege were repeated and applied without further analysis at various points during the trial on the merits of the case.

In support of this motion and in a general effort to discover the extent of Kuh’s involvement in the investigation, defendant called Kuh as a pretrial witness, serving upon him a subpoena duces tecum, which required Kuh to produce certain documents (hereinafter the Kuh documents). In particular, the subpoena directed Kuh to produce (1) telephone records, (2) time records, (3) records relating to work done by investigative agencies, and (4) records relating to interviews of witnesses.

He also turned over photocopies of medical records and information concerning defendant’s trip to the Bahamas “with someone other than his wife” and generally informed the State Police of information he had obtained from his clients and from Dr. Stock.

Notwithstanding the assertions of Kuh and Alex that the nature of Kuh’s work was always intended to be kept confidential, the above facts constitute an irrevocable breach of that confidentiality. This breach of confidentiality in our opinion rises to the level of waiver, thereby destroying an essential element of the privilege.

The next morning, after noticing that Mrs. von Bu-low had not awakened at her usual hour, Miss Schrallhammer attempted to check on her but was advised by defendant that Mrs. von Bulow had a sore throat and should not be disturbed. Nonetheless, Miss Schrall-hammer checked on Mrs. von Bulow and was unable to arouse her. The defendant, nevertheless, failed to call a doctor until several hours later, at which time he failed to describe her condition adequately. Miss Schrallhammer felt that the statements made by defendant to the doctor that his wife was an alcoholic, had been drinking the night before, and had been out of bed earlier that day were “not true.” Four hours subsequent to the first call, defendant again telephoned the doctor and requested that he come to the house. Doctor Gailitis found Mrs. von Bulow in a comatose state. Shortly after his arrival, Mrs. von Bulow experienced cardiac arrest and <a id="p1023" href="#p1023" data-label="1023" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1023</a>had to be resuscitated by the doctor.

From the facts presented, the prosecution asked the jury to draw two primary inferences: that both comas were caused by exogenous insulin and that the black bag and its contents belonged to defendant. From these primary inferences, the jury was asked to draw the secondary inference that defendant was guilty of assault with intent to murder.</p>

Without this inference as its foundation, the secondary inference of guilt must fall. Accordingly, the defendant’s guilt is not an exclusive inference to be drawn from the facts. The facts surrounding count 1 at most support a conclusion that the defendant acted in an unhusbandlike, rather than in a criminal, manner.

The state argues that because defendant did not object to the omission of an instruction on inference stacking, the rule of the law of the case bars our review of this issue. This argument is without foundation. When a court properly instructs a jury on the standards of reasonable doubt, no further instruction on inference stacking is necessary. <em>See State v.

A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is properly made by a motion for a judgment of acquittal. On appeal we are bound by the same standards as the trial justice. <em>State v.

On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence by asking us to review all of the evidence presented at trial. The defendant, however, misconceives the nature of a motion for a judgment of acquittal. The "sole target” of review is the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the state relies to establish a defendant’s guilt. <em>State v.

Medical opinions concerning the cause of Martha von Bulow’s comas were elicited through the use of hypothetical questions posed to medical expert witnesses. The state concedes that the hypothetical question posed to its primary expert, Dr. Cahill, was factually erroneous regarding the time of one of the glucose pushes. In the context of my analysis of this issue, however, I shall assume that this erroneous information did not influence Dr. Cahill’s conclusion.</p>
