    <p id="b930-6" data-blocks='[["BL_930.6",930,[198,805,758,1003]]]'>This appeal involves a commercial landlord’s attempt to confess judgment against its tenant. The Superior Court granted the tenant’s motion to vacate the judgment, holding that the confession of judgment clause did not apply to the tenant’s failure to pay rent diming the holdover period after the expiration of the original lease term. The trial court also held that an amendment to the original lease did not effectively incorporate the confession of judgment clause into the amended lease, which covers different space for a term expiring in 2007. We agree with the trial court’s analysis of the original lease, but disagree with its interpretation of the amended lease. Accordingly, we affirm, but write to clarify our view of the parties’ rights and obligations under the amended lease.</p>

    <p id="b930-8" data-blocks='[["BL_930.8",930,[196,1921,755,756]]]'>Eugene A. Delle Donne and Son, L.P. owns an office building in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, known as 800 Delaware Avenue. Applied Card Systems, Inc. (“ACS”) rented space on five upper floors of the building by lease dated June 26, 1996 (the “Lease”). The parties agree that the Lease term expired on December 31, 2001. In September 1997, ACS decided that it wanted additional space in the building, and the parties executed an amendment to the Lease, under which ACS rented space on the first floor for a term running from September 5, 1997 through September 30, 2007.</p>
    <p id="b930-9" data-blocks='[["BL_930.9",930,[1003,270,751,766]]]'>When the Lease term expired on December 31, 2001, ACS did not vacate the original space it occupied for several months. As a result, ACS became a holdover tenant as to that space. Because ACS failed to pay the stated holdover rent, Delle Donne confessed judgment against ACS in the amount of $803,273.64. That amount represented the months of holdover rent, late charges, and the accelerated rent for the new, first floor space from March 2002 through September 2007. ACS moved to vacate the judgment and the Superior Court granted its motion. This appeal followed.</p>

It authorizes a confession of judgment for any Event of Default that is not cured within a specified period. One of several “Events of Default” is the failure to pay any rent installment during the term of the Lease.</p>
    <p id="b932-4" data-blocks='[["BL_932.4",932,[192,642,755,795]]]'>To this point, the analysis is straightforward. Two problems arise, however, when attempting to apply the confession of judgment clause to the facts presented. First, ACS’s failure to pay rent occurred after the expiration of the original Lease term. ACS was a holdover tenant as to the upper floors after December 31, 2001, and the unpaid rent was for the upper floor holdover tenancy. Thus, the unpaid holdover rent was not an Event of Default because it did not occur during the term of the Lease. The Superior Court reached this conclusion, and we agree that it is the only reasonable interpretation of the contract language.</p>
    <p id="b932-5" data-blocks='[["BL_932.5",932,[190,1470,754,843]]]'>The second problem relates to the Amendment. Delle Donne argues that the Superior Court’s holding — that there is no right to confess judgment for failure to pay holdover rent — means that Delle Donne has no contractual remedies for any defaults that may occur with respect to the amended Lease. The Superior Court’s holding on this point is not entirely clear, although it did decide that Delle Donne has no right to confess judgment under the amended Lease. We read the Amendment differently and conclude that the right to confess judgment, as well as all other provisions of the original Lease, apply to the first floor space identified in the amended Lease.</p>
    <p id="b932-6" data-blocks='[["BL_932.6",932,[190,2344,751,243]],["BL_932.7",932,[994,269,752,888]]]'>The 1997 Amendment is not a separate lease; it is an addition to the original Lease. It identifies the new “First Expansion Space,” and sets the rental rate and term for the new space. The Amendment then provides, “As of the date of this Amendment, the Lease shall be deemed to mean the original Lease as amended by this Amendment.” In other words, the Amendment was made a part of the original Lease and all of the terms and conditions of the original Lease became applicable to the First Expansion Space. Thus, although Delle Donne could not confess judgment against ACS with respect to the upper floor space because the term for that space had expired, it retains the authority to confess judgment for the first floor space (or use the other remedies provided in the original Lease) for the remainder of the First Expansion Space term.</p>
    <p id="b932-9" data-blocks='[["BL_932.8",932,[990,1209,753,1379]]]'>ACS contends that this analysis may apply to the other remedies available under the original Lease, but not to the confession of judgment provision. As authority for its position, ACS relies on the principle that confession of judgment clauses are strictly construed and will not be deemed incorporated in a second document by a “general and nonspecific reference.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We are not persuaded. First, the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision ACS relies upon involved obvious overreaching — the lessees were immigrants who spoke broken English; they were told by the lessor that they should use the lessor’s attorney instead of retaining one of their own; and the confession of judgment provision was never discussed. Second, in this case, there was no incorporation by reference into the Amendment. The original Lease remains the controlling document and the Amendment simply added the First Expansion Space to the parties’ existing agreement. Thus, the confession of judgment provision remains enforceable as applied to the new space.</p>
