Cesarano, appeals the trial court’s dismissal of her employment discrimination claims on the ground that they are time barred. We affirm the dismissal of her claims pertaining to the alleged failure of appellee, Reed Smith LLP, to grant her reasonable accommodation due to her disability, as well as her claim relating to her leave status.

    <p id="b499-16" data-blocks='[["BL_499.16",499,[969,1057,753,1026]]]'>The record in this case reveals that on October 24, 2003, Ms. Cesarano filed a complaint against her employer, Reed Smith. She alleged that she was employed as an associate around March 20, 2000, and was assigned to the litigation department. On April 29, 2001, while she was attending a Reed Smith trial training program, Ms. Cesarano’s dominant hand was burned. As a result of her right hand injury, she developed complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a physiological disorder affecting the neurological body system. The disorder, characterized as permanent, caused extreme pain and resulted in medical limitations on her activities. She required physical therapy, occupational hand therapy, nerve block procedures, and she had to take prescribed medication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>Based upon the recommendation of her physician, Ms. Cesarano took a leave of absence from June 13 to July 12, 2001, for treatment of her hand injury. Diming her leave of absence, Ms. Cesarano requested accommodations by Reed Smith for her disability. Specifically, she requested (1) a reduced-hour schedule, (2) voice recognition software, and (3) an operator’s headset for her telephone. Upon her return to Reed Smith, Ms. Cesarano worked four hours per day. Around July 19, 2001, she complained about the difficulty of working without voice recognition software. In response, Richard Sullivan, her supervisor at the law firm, allegedly informed Ms. Ces-arano “that if she was still injured, she was ‘of no use to anyone.’ ” Ms. Cesarano experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient work assignments at Reed Smith to meet the billing expectations of the firm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[194,1351,752,958]],["BL_500.6",500,[992,265,752,300]]]'>On July 20, 2001, Ms. Cesarano complained to her employer that she was receiving neither reasonable accommodation for her disability, nor enough work to generate billable hours. Reed Smith’s managing partner of the firm’s District of Columbia office, Douglas Spaulding, advised Ms. Cesarano “that she had experienced a ‘stutter step’ in her career,” that the firm could not “carry her,” and that she might be “pushed out” of the firm. Sometime later, Ms. Cesarano transmitted a letter to Reed Smith from her doctor; the letter stated that a second medical leave of absence was necessary. The second period of leave commenced around August 6, 2001, and extended to October 24, 2001. Ms. Cesarano was treated with physical therapy and medicine. When she returned to work, partners at Reed Smith advised her “not to seek substantive billable work until she could work without restrictions.” Although she tried to obtain billable work, she obtained only a few assignments.</p>
    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.7",500,[993,591,753,812]]]'>By January 2, 2002, Ms. Cesarano notified Reed Smith that she could increase her hours of work from four to eight per day. In her self-evaluation report to the firm, she expressed “hope” that she would get more billable work, and she continued her search for such work within the firm. Ms. Cesarano was encouraged by positive comments from the firm on her efforts to promote Reed Smith through the Greater Washington Board of Trade, and her participation in a <em>pro bono </em>case with a partner from the Pittsburgh office during 2001 and 2002. Nevertheless, she continued to complain about the lack of billable assignments.</p>
    <p id="b500-8" data-blocks='[["BL_500.8",500,[994,1436,753,871]],["BL_501.1",501,[179,258,750,247]]]'>In March 2002, Ms. Cesarano notified the Human Resources office of the firm that her doctor had recommended that she obtain an ergonomic evaluation of her worksite. Her doctor sent a letter to the firm in early April 2002, indicating that she was restricted to a work day of eight hours and needed an ergonomic worksite evaluation. Approximately one month later, Ms. Cesarano received a performance evaluation with a rating of “Meets Expectations Minus.” Mr. Sullivan related to her the need for 200 billable hours per month before he could recommend her retention. In response, Ms. Cesarano “expressed concern to Mr. Sullivan about [his] statement given the medical restrictions on <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>her workday.” Mr. Sullivan interpreted Ms. Cesarano’s reaction as an indication that “she could not do the work.” Ms. Cesarano repeated her work restrictions and her request for accommodations.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[178,533,753,1080]]]'>Ms. Cesarano’s ergonomic worksite evaluation was completed around June 6, 2002. She maintained that “Reed Smith never provided [her with] a worksite that fully conformed to the ergonomic evaluation.” However, Ms. Cesarano’s “billable hours significantly increased toward the end of the summer 2002.” But, in her September 6, 2002 self evaluation, she noted the difficulty in finding billable work despite her new eight-hour work schedule, and she asserted that the firm had denied her reasonable accommodation. Ms. Cesarano received another performance evaluation in late October 2002; apparently because of her low annualized chargeable hours, she was again given a rating of “Meets Expectations Minus.” On October 28, 2002, she received notice that she would be terminated from the firm effective November 11, 2002.</p>
    <p id="b501-6" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[174,1642,754,1028]],["BL_501.6",501,[980,259,752,193]]]'>Ms. Cesarano alleged five causes of action. Although no count is labeled wrongful termination, it is apparent from an examination of her various counts that she alleged wrongful termination. Significantly, both the trial court and the parties recognized through rulings and pleadings that the case included a wrongful termination claim. Count I, “Retaliation and interference in violation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act” (“DCHRA”), emphasized her July 6, 2001 request for voice recognition software and a part-time schedule as accommodation for her disability, and Reed Smith’s alleged retaliation against her “for requesting accommodation.” She claimed that “Reed Smith’s retaliatory and threatening responses to [her] requests for accommodation and references to her physical limitations interfered with [her] rights to inform Reed Smith of her disability and request reasonable accommodation in violation of Section 2-1402.61(a)(l) of the [DCHRA].”</p>
    <p id="b501-8" data-blocks='[["BL_501.7",501,[976,478,754,919]]]'>Count II focused on alleged disability discrimination under the DCHRA, D.C.Code § 2-1401.02(5A). She highlighted Reed Smith’s actions in removing her from a case on which she was working at the time of her accident and the firm’s alleged position that, despite her qualifications and experience, she should not expect billable work until she returned to full-time employment. She specifically alleged that “[b]y terminating her on the purported basis of insufficient billable hours, Reed Smith terminated [her] on account of disability and handicap”; and that “[i]n terminating [her], [Reed Smith] failed to retain an employee who had become physically handicapped while on the job....”</p>
    <p id="b501-9" data-blocks='[["BL_501.8",501,[976,1423,754,762]]]'>Count III, “Failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of [the DCHRA],” averred, in part, that Reed Smith failed to provide voice recognition software in response to her request until early August 2001; did not accommodate her with an eight-hour workday, despite her December 2001 and January 2002 requests; ignored her request for an ergonomic work site, as well as her March 2002 request for an ergonomic worksite evaluation until June 6, 2002, but then took no action regarding the results of the evaluation — all in violation of specified sections of the DCHRA.</p>

Reed Smith also asserted affirmative defenses, including “statutes of limitations.” Months later, on July 30, 2004, Reed Smith sought partial summary judgment as to Counts II, III and IV of Ms. Cesarano’s complaint. The firm contended that Ms. Cesarano was not a person with a disability during her employment; individualized notice was not required under the DCFMLA; and statutes of limitation barred the causes of action. On September 17, 2004, Reed Smith filed a motion for summary judgment, in which it incorporated its motion for partial summary judgment. The firm generally argued that it was entitled to <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>summary judgment on the remaining counts because Ms. Cesarano was discharged for “low annualized chargeable hours” rather than as a result of disability discrimination, the firm’s failure to accommodate a disability, the taking of family and medical leave, sex discrimination, or her complaints about sex discrimination. Reed Smith’s motions included statements of “undisputed facts” and references to various affidavits and depositions.</p>
    <p id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[169,847,753,769]]]'>Ms. Cesarano opposed Reed Smith’s motions on October 27, 2004 and July 12, 2005. She sought to demonstrate that summary judgment was inappropriate, generally she took issue with Reed Smith’s statement of “undisputed facts” and its reliance on statutes of limitations; and she pointed to evidence, reflected in affidavits and depositions, supporting the allegations of her complaint. Much of her focus centered on establishing discriminatory discharge and retaliation. She claimed that Reed Smith’s asserted non-discriminatory reason for her discharge actually was a pretext for discrimination and retaliation.</p>
    <p id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[167,1641,752,611]]]'>The trial court issued a thirty-one page order on September 5, 2007, granting Reed Smith’s motions. The court found the following facts in dispute: “the facts surrounding whether or not [Ms. Cesara-no] is disabled,” “the facts surrounding the reasoning behind [her] actual termination,” and “the facts surrounding whether or not [Reed Smith] made sufficient accommodations to [Ms. Cesarano’s] condition.” Re-latedly, the court concluded that the following material facts are in issue:</p>
    <blockquote id="b503-7" data-blocks='[["BL_503.6",503,[204,2269,714,402]],["BL_503.7",503,[1013,262,710,248]]]'>[F]irst, whether plaintiffs condition substantially limits one or more of her major life activities and is, in fact, disabled; second, whether defendant’s conduct, in particular its accommodation (or lack thereof from plaintiffs point of view) of plaintiffs condition in terms of hours, workspace, etc., constitutes discrimination and/or retaliation under DCHRA and DCFMLA; and third, whether defendant had legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions relating to plaintiff and her employment.</blockquote>
    <p id="b503-9" data-blocks='[["BL_503.8",503,[971,535,751,666]]]'>Therefore, the court did not consider the merits of Ms. Cesarano’s claims because material facts are in issue. However, the trial court determined that “it is apparent that the facts, as provided by the evidence, áre not in dispute in terms of timing of the allegations,” and further stated: “it is appropriate for the court to consider whether or not summary judgment is appropriate on grounds that the allegations occurred outside the statute of limitations.” After reviewing the evidence the court declared, in part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b503-10" data-blocks='[["BL_503.9",503,[1010,1223,709,395]]]'>As the evidence illustrates, plaintiffs concerns regarding discrimination are documented as early as July of 2001, shortly after incurring her injury.

In her deposition, plaintiff stated: “During my evaluation on May 16th of 2002, Mr. Sullivan told me that I would need to bill 200-hour months in order for him to make the argument to keep me around.” Cesara-no Depo. at p. 7:1-7. As her own words indicate, plaintiff knew with absolute certainty that she would be unable to bill the 200 hours per month until her next review and would be facing her inevitable termination in the fall of that same year.... Further, plaintiffs administrative complaint against defendant was filed on July 24, 2003. This fact strengthens defendant’s argument that <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>plaintiffs claims under DCHRA and DCFMLA are based on events that occurred on or before July 23, 2002 and that plaintiffs official notice of termination, October of 2002, merely is an effect ... of defendant’s alleged discrimination.</blockquote>

As she asserts in her reply brief: “As stated in her Complaint, the decision to terminate Ms. Cesarano constituted disparate treatment on the basis of her disability and sex (Counts II, V), retaliation for protected conduct under the DCFMLA and DCHRA (Counts I, IV), interference with her DCFMLA rights (Count IV), and a denial of reasonable accommodations (Count III).” She argues that “Reed Smith did not seek summary judgment on [her] termination claims on statute of limitations grounds” and states that Reed Smith “conceded” the timeliness of her termination claims in the trial court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> She maintains that “claims of unlawful termination accrue on the date that an employer gives explicit notice of its decision to terminate an employee,” and that Reed Smith did not make the decision to terminate her until October 2002. Thus, she takes issue with the trial court’s conclusion that she “was on notice of her impending termination in May of 2002 when she received her [associate review].” She claims that the trial court’s “decision imposes upon plaintiffs the burden to <em>predict </em>their termination even before an employer necessarily decides to terminate the employee” (emphasis in original). In her view, the trial court’s decision is “based ... on disputed facts and inferences drawn in favor of Reed Smith, the moving party.”</p>
    <p id="b504-9" data-blocks='[["BL_504.10",504,[990,687,754,818]]]'>Reed Smith contends that “the statute of limitations begins to run, not when the ultimate injury may be felt, but when the discriminatory actions occurred,” and that “the crux of [Ms.] Cesarano’s complaint is that Reed Smith discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her hand injury, by denying her billable work and by otherwise preventing her from meeting the firm’s billable hour requirements of associates, and by interfering with the exercise of her leave rights.” Therefore, Reed Smith concludes, Ms. Cesarano’s “termination ... was simply the effect of the prior discriminatory acts of which [she] complains in her lawsuit.”</p>

Aseff, M.D., a physiatrist and Director of Electro-diagnostic Services at the National Rehabilitation Hospital. He provided an affidavit on October 19, 2004, detailing not only his treatment of Ms. Cesarano's right hand pain but also her "secondary myofascial pain syndrome” relating to her neck and shoulder. His treatment began on May 21, 2001, and was continuing at the time he executed his affidavit. The affidavit summarized his recommendations regarding the need for (1) a leave of absence for periods between mid-June 2001 and October 2001, (2) limitations on the number of hours Ms. Cesarano could work per day, (3) restrictions on the use of her right hand, (4) "a work site that would conform to reasonable ergonomic standards as necessary for Ms. Cesarano's specific conditions,” and (5) nerve block procedures. Dr. Aseff concluded his affidavit by asserting: "Unfortunately, Ms. Cesarano’s condition requires that she pay attention to her pain and compensate for it by how she performs functional tasks, regardless of whether in the office or in other life activities, and not allow <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>herself to overuse her right hand. This dilemma is not merely about pacing herself, but requires actions and reactions on an ongoing basis to maintain her functional capacity, even if it means to postpone or avoid a specific activity.”</p>
