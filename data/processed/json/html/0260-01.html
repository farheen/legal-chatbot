Although <em>Bailey I </em>dealt with escape when a prisoner leaves an institution or the custody of a government representative, the D.C. Circuit suggested that the rule was applicable to our situation, i.e. when a prisoner escapes by failing to return to the institution or custody of a government representative. "We therefore agree that the trial court should instruct the jury that a prisoner who lacks the intent to avoid confinement at the time he leaves custody may nevertheless commit the crime of escape if he later forms that intent and therefore fails to report to the authorities or turn himself in.” <a href="/us-app-dc/190/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="190 U.S. App. D.C. 142" data-case-ids="3776997" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/190/0142-01">190 U.S.App.D.C. at </a>148 n. 17, <a href="/us-app-dc/190/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="585 F.2d 1087" data-case-ids="3776997,845854" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/190/0142-01,/f2d/585/1087-01">585 F.2d at </a>1093 n. 17. Criminal Jury Instruction 4.99A does not distinguish between these two types of escape when imposing the requirement that the escape be with an "intent to avoid further confinement,” and we see no basis to conclude that the elements should be defined differently. Therefore, the <em>Bailey </em>line of cases are certainly relevant to our issue — escape by failure to return to lawful custody.</p>

Appellant suggests on appeal that even if "intent to avoid further confinement” is not an element of escape, the failure to possess that intent may be an independent defense to the charge at least in cases of failure to return. We see no basis to distinguish the two types of escape in this regard and think this argument quite incompatible with <em>Bailey II.</em>
