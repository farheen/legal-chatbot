    <p id="b618-8" data-blocks='[["BL_618.7",618,[1005,338,749,1581]]]'>The trial court found that John Robinson had a monthly gross income of $2,944.90. This monthly amount provided an annual income of $35,338.80, or almost $5,000 <em>more </em>than he was earning at the time the initial order was issued. After subtraction of the amount that John Robinson owes annually for the support of his two children from another relationship, $3,600, his adjusted income was $31,738.80. At the time, Darren was six years old. Under the guideline established by the temporary act then in effect, John Robinson was expected to contribute 22% of his adjusted income for Darren’s support. This percentage put John Robinson’s basic support obligation at $6,982.54. Because the trial court did not make findings regarding Claudia Robinson’s gross income or her child care expenses for Darren, however, we are unable to calculate the correct offset amount, based on the circumstances of the parties at the time. We therefore cannot determine whether “application of the child support guideline to the current circumstances of the parties results in an amount of child support that varies from the amount of the existing order by 15% or more,” entitling John Robinson to “a presumption that there has been a substantial or material change of circumstances that warrants a modification of [the] child support order,” in accordance with D.C.Code § 16-916.-1(c)(3).</p>

Therefore, John Robinson’s adjusted support obligation could only have decreased sufficiently to qualify for the presumption if the offset based on Claudia Robinson’s income and child care expenses had increased dramatically. Such a result is extremely unlikely, given that the parties both worked for the same employer in similar positions.</p>

D.C.Code § 16-916.-l(o)(4) provides that “[t]he central figure stated in the guideline shall be used to compute the amount of child support that the guideline would yield for modification and to apply the test for the presumption.” This provision leaves unclear whether the adjusted support obligation based on the current circumstances of the parties must vary by 15% or more from the amount in the original order, $383.08 per month, or from the amount of the original support obligation before the 3% variation, $450.31 per month.

While this amount may be consistent with a combined payment of $537 per month for both the car loan and car insurance, we note that the trial court’s finding about the amount of the payment appears to be based on testimony at a hearing in the case concerning John Robinson's children from another relationship. In determining John Robinson’s child support obligation to Darren Robinson, the trial court may not rely on testimony that was not presented at the hearing in Claudia Robinson’s case.</p>
