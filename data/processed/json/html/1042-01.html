We also consider whether a trial court may impose probationary conditions permitting searches of defendant’s residence absent reasonable suspicion and if a trial court can impose parole conditions where defendant’s sentence was for two or more years.

After Galendez entered a barber shop, Officer Johnson and other officers entered the shop and arrested him. During a subsequent search, the officers found a loaded handgun in Galendez’s waistband.</p>

The suppression court denied the motion on the basis that Galendez’s arresting officer testified that he knew Galendez was wanted on a scofflaw warrant and for questioning in a carjacking. The suppression court also reasoned that the defense <a id="p1045" href="#p1045" data-label="1045" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1045</a>had presented no evidence to show that the claimed warrant was not valid.</p>

Galendez’s attorney filed a timely post-sentence motion, contesting the imposition of the random search condition, which the trial court denied. This appeal followed.</p>

He argues that probable cause was lacking because the arresting officer merely testified that Galendez was wanted on a scofflaw warrant and was wanted for questioning, and that this testimony, by itself, did not provide a basis for a warrantless arrest. In other words, Gal-endez contends that it was incumbent upon the Commonwealth to prove the validity of the outstanding warrant, by producing a copy of the warrant at the suppression hearing, to support a determination of probable cause justifying the warrantless arrest.

As such, the Commonwealth met its burden of proof and we find that the suppression court properly denied Galendez’s suppression motion.

The probationary condition is not only invalid because it was entered without notice to or in the presence of Galendez and his attorney two days following sentencing, but, as our full Court held in <em>Commonwealth v.

The only information supporting Officer Johnson forcing Galendez to the barber shop floor at gunpoint was: (1) he knew Galendez as a regular in the neighborhood; (2) he knew Galendez from previous incidents; (8) he knew Galendez had an outstanding scofflaw warrant; and (4) he knew Galendez was wanted “in the east division” for questioning in a carjacking.
