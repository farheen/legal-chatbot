    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.7",271,[99,462,1321,143]]]'>Appellants’ five claims for patent for an incandescent flash-light lamp were rejected by the examiner and the Board of Appeals, and. from the decision of the latter, appeal is taken to this court.</p>
    <p id="b271-7" data-blocks='[["BL_271.8",271,[99,614,1329,1003]]]'>The subject matter of the application is an incandescent flash-light lamp, having inserted in the hollow cap of the lamp base a hermetically sealed closed glass receptacle, and enclosed in the receptacle is a thermostatic self-interrupting device which consists of two resilient contact tongues molten into the receptacle, one or both of said tongues being composed of thermostat metal or else being bimetallic thermostat strips of the usual structure. Wrapped around one of the resilient contact tongues is a heating winding connected in series with the filament. The contact tongues are provided with break contacts of tungsten. When the thermostat is under the direct control of radiation of heat from the filaments, the same will be brought into operation to close the current through the lamp so that the current is interrupted every few seconds in the break contracts. When, on account of the interrupting current, the thermostat again cools down, the current circuit is again closed and the filament begins to glow anew. The repetition of these functions produces a flash-light result without any external relay devices. It is said that the device may be attached to or used in connection with sadirons, curling irons, soldering irons, cooking plates, and other similar electrical devices, where it is essential that overheating does not occur.</p>

Certainly nothing new of a patentable character has been suggested in this court.</p>

Nor is it contended that the principle of resilient contact tongues is new. It is urged that taking these different known devices and assembling them together in the form of a flashlight lamp is such a combination as produces a hew result and requires invention.</p>
    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[108,482,1321,1140]]]'>It is a well-settled principle of patent law that a combination of old devices which produces no other result than the sum of the results produced by each of the devices is not patentable. Where a given number of elements, which produce a known result when functioning separately, is assembled and the assembly produces only a combination of the results found in the individual units, no invention is shown and amounts to an aggregation. While decreasing or increasing the size of the known units or making a rearrangement of them may produce a valuable and efficiently working mechanism which is conducive to commercial success, this fact does not necessarily suggest invention. If appellants by their assembly or combination have produced a flashlight lamp, popular with the public (which, probably, they have done), they are entitled to a commercial success from its manufacture and sale. Patent law, however, is not alone concerned with use and saleability. The law was intended, in part, to stimulate and reward inventive genius. This praiseworthy motive on the part of the legislature would hardly be promoted by the granting of a monopoly upon a mere aggregation of things already invented or known when no new inventive genius is displayed. <em>In re </em>Vissering, <a href="/f2d/24/1013-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="24 F.2d 1013" data-case-ids="1713323,1713361" data-case-paths="/f2d/24/1013-01,/f2d/24/1013-02">24 F.
