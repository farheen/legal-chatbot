    <p id="b677-6" data-blocks='[["BL_677.7",677,[179,428,753,1019]]]'>The plaintiffs, Alan MacQuattie and Robert Sousa, have appealed the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, who included the superintendent of schools in the town of Barrington, Rhode Island, and members of the Town of Bar-rington School Committee (collectively, school defendants), and officers of the United Steelworkers of America (union). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 8, 2001, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time.</p>

Beginning in September or October 1994, officials from the Barrington School Department required plaintiffs and a third custodian on the same night shift to complete daily checklists designed to monitor job performance. The plaintiffs filed a grievance with the union, challenging the use of the performance checklists. The union declined to pursue the grievance with the committee after concluding that the use of the performance checklists was a fair method of evaluating the evening custodians’ work, given that no supervisor worked on the evening shift.</p>
    <p id="b677-11" data-blocks='[["BL_677.13",677,[977,454,756,1744]]]'>In March 1995, Barrington School Superintendent Ralph A. Malafronte informed plaintiffs that the school committee would consider their termination at an April 6, 1995 hearing because of their poor job performance and their “failure to respond to repeated warnings and counselling.” After learning this, plaintiffs filed the instant action in Superi- or Court. The complaint alleged unfair labor practices by the school committee in violation of G.L.1956 § 28-7-13,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> unfair representation by the union, failure to properly administer the overtime eligibility of plaintiffs, failure of the superintendent to respond in a timely manner to plaintiffs’ grievances on overtime policy, and it protested the use of checklists. The plaintiffs sought a restraining order to prevent the hearing from going forward, but the restraining order was denied, and plaintiffs’ employment was terminated effective April 10, 1995. The union then filed a grievance on plaintiffs’ behalf, contesting the termination. The grievance went to arbitration, where it was denied. In the Superior Court action, the union’s attorney stated that “the arbitrator noted the complaints of both parents and teachers with respect to the work performance of both of the plaintiffs.” The union and the school defendants filed motions for summary judgment that were granted in favor of both defendants. The plaintiffs appealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Such a termination would constitute an unfair labor practice, plaintiffs alleged. The plaintiffs, however, have presented no evidence that would support this contention. Mere allegations to the contrary contained in plaintiffs’ pleadings are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bourg v.

Exclusive original jurisdiction in unfair labor cases is generally in the State Labor Relations Board under the State Labor Relations Act, § 28-7-21, and the Superior Court does not have jurisdiction until administrative remedies have been exhausted. <em>Paton v.
