The Clients had ample opportunity to raise their breach of contract theory in an amended complaint, in their response to the Attorneys’ motion for judgment on the pleadings, and even perhaps in the motion for reconsideration.

Moreover, in the instant matter, the Superior Court did not evaluate whether the trial court properly interpreted the facts pleaded in support of the Clients’ claim for professional malpractice. To the contrary, the Superi- or Court in this case evaluated whether the Complaint contained an entirely different, previously unstated, theory of recovery.

Thus, it seems clear that the matter of other theories of relief was no more or no less waived in <em>Lobolito </em>than it is in this case, and that this Court’s examination of the complaint in <em>Lobolito </em>for equitable theories was, in fact, undertaken <em>sua sponte.</em>
