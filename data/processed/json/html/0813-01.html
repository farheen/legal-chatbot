Although I am cognizant of the fact that the Governor is required to present a balanced budget to the General Assembly, it is inappropriate for this court to perform a function that necessarily belongs to the executive branch. Nevertheless, if there is any consensus to be had in regard to the budgetary limitations for the payment of legal services for indigent misdemeanor defendants, it belongs to the legislative and not the executive branch of the government; where the Legislature has the the power to appoint counsel for indigent misdemeanor defendants, it is within the purview of the Legislature’s powers to dictate the funds necessary for the payment of such services. <em>See Roe v. Affleck, </em><a href="/ri/120/0679-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="120 R.I. 679" data-case-ids="8519897" data-case-paths="/ri/120/0679-01">120 R.I. 679</a>, <a href="/ri/120/0679-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="120 R.I. 679" data-case-ids="8519897" data-case-paths="/ri/120/0679-01">390 A.2d 361</a> (1978) (even though this court has recognized the validity of considering budgetary limitations in determining the extent of state-funded benefits for indigents, the budgetary limitations were enacted and imposed by the legislative and not the executive branch of the government).</p>

These cases make clear that even after <em>Scott, </em>this court held that the Rhode Island Constitution afforded indigent defendants a higher degree of protection; that is, we have recognized the right of indigent persons to appointed counsel notwithstanding that the trial justice determines that no incarceration will be imposed.</p>

By answering His Excellency’s request in the negative, the majority’s decision effectively reduces the range of discretion previously afforded to trial justices in misdemeanor cases. The majority would have each trial justice determine whether incarceration may be imposed at the initial stages of an action, regardless of any later developments that may require the trial justice to impose a sanction of imprisonment. It is noteworthy that the District Court judges have represented that such a result would profoundly affect the quality of justice which is administered in the trial courts. Undeniably, by structure, they are positioned at the threshold to the access of justice.</p>
