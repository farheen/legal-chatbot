    <p id="b809-10" data-blocks='[["BL_809.11",809,[63,775,1324,193]]]'>This is an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, dismissing the opposition and adjudging that the applicant was entitled to the registration of its trade-mark.</p>

    <p id="b809-12" data-blocks='[["BL_809.13",809,[63,1078,1324,849]]]'>The Celotex Co. was organized in 1920 and began the manufacture of wall board known as “ Celotex ” in 1921 and has increased its production from 18,000,000 square feet in 1922 to approximately 500,000,000 square feet in 1929. Seven thousand retail dealers in 82 countries, on the last named date, were handling “ Celotex.” More than $3,500,000 have been expended in advertising “ Celotex.” Appellant claims that the word “ Celotex ” has become a <em>“ </em>byword ” for wall board and that the merchandise represented by it has an enviable reputation for its insulating and sound absorbing properties. From 1921 to 1928 appellant states no other manufacturer of wall board made any effort to use any trade-mark on its product which involved the suffix “ tex ” or in any other way sought to simulate its trade-mark; that beginning with the year 1928 a great number of manufacturers of wall board, including applicant, adopted trade-marks which appellant contends closely resemble “ Celotex ” and with the obvious purpose of trading upon the popularity of appellant’s mark.</p>

After all, the determination of the question of likelihood of confusion or mistake in the use of trademarks must, as a general rule, be a matter of opinion, and not the result of testimony produced as to the existence or absence of such confusion. Therefore, the tribunals of the Patent Office, and this court as a revieAving body, may, in cases Avhere one adopts and uses a mark Avith the motive of confusing the mind of the public, consider that motive as one of the factors in determining the question of whether use of such mark is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public.</blockquote>

The Commissioner concluded that the suffix “ tex ” had become public property because of the fact that a considerable number of trade-marks ending with the syllable had been previously registered for use upon the same class of goods and other goods, and evidently gave this fact controlling effect in his decision.</p>
    <p id="b811-3" data-blocks='[["BL_811.4",811,[65,566,1321,496]]]'>It seems to us that this line of reasoning suggests that if there is confusion or a strong probability of confusion due to the presence of the term “ tex ” in both marks, that such confusion is excusable and is not sufficient basis for a refusal to register. Irrespective of any rights which the parties or other trade-mark users may have in equity, as determined by their conduct and the use of their respective marks, the registration statute by its express terms denies registration if confusion to purchasers results. As we see it, Congress, by creating a place of registration, sought to minimize rather than to add to the public’s confusion.</p>

The answer to this argument is that appellant’s trade-mark is “ Zipper,” not “ Zip.” Nor is appellant entitled to the exclusive use of every trademark formed by the use of the word “ Zip.” But surely, if the statute providing for the registration of trade-marks is not to be a weapon for the perpetration of fraud and deceit, registrants of trade-marks are entitled to some measure of protection from those who designedly or otherwise closely simulate such marks and, due to confusion in the mind of the public, trade on the popularity and good will of the registrant.</blockquote>
