In February 2008, a Wildlife Conservation Officer of the Pennsylvania Game Commission found Appellant Mark Brooks Clegg in possession of two rifles during a hunting incident. Appellant had a prior conviction for attempted burglary. The Commonwealth charged Appellant with a violation of § 6105, along with summary violations of the Game and Wildlife Code. Appellant filed an omnibus pretrial motion to dismiss the § 6105 charge. At a hearing on the motion, Appellant argued that the trial court should dismiss the charge because § 6105 does not list attempted burglary as a qualifying offense. The trial court agreed and dismissed the § 6105 charge on August 28, 2008. The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court.</p>

The majority of the court noted that § 6105(b) does not expressly list attempted burglary (or attempt generally) as a qualifying offense. The majority found, however, that attempted burglary qualified under the savings clause. The savings clause provides that “[a qualifying offense is] any offense equivalent to any of the above-enumerated offenses under the prior laws of this Commonwealth[.]” 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(b). The majority reasoned that attempted burglary was a qualifying offense under a prior law of the Commonwealth, namely a version of the Act in effect prior to 1995. Specifically, former § 6105 prohibited a person who has been convicted of a “crime of violence” from possessing a firearm; former § 6102 defined a “crime of violence” as one of 12 crimes (including burglary), “or an attempt ... to commit ... the same[.]” Thus, the majority found that under the prior version of § 6105, attempted burglary constituted a crime of violence, and a crime of violence was a qualifying offense permitting the invocation of § 6105. The majority then reasoned that this interpretation made “attempted burglary — a crime of violence” the equivalent of a “burglary” under the current version of § 6105, and accordingly included attempted burglary as if it was an enumerated offense under the current version of § 6105.</p>

In identifying the enumerated crimes that define the offense of persons not to possess firearms under § 6105, the Legislature did not resort to general language such as “crime of violence.” Instead it specifically listed 38 crimes.

Section 6104, in addressing evidence of intent, also makes specific reference to “a person ... committing or <em>attempting to commit </em>a crime.... ” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6104 (emphasis added). Section 6105, by contrast, makes no such specific reference to convictions for an <em>attempt to commit </em>any of the offenses listed in § 6105(b).

Appellant sought our review, noting that the question of whether inchoate crimes should be included within the ambit of § 6105 is an issue of first impression and public importance. We agreed, and granted review to determine “whether attempted burglary is one of the offenses for which a prior conviction qualifies a person, who owns, operates, or possesses a firearm, for prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105 (former convict not to possess a firearm).”</p>
    <p id="b1302-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1302.7",1302,[997,1004,753,1239]]]'>Appellant argues that the Superior Court erred in finding attempted burglary to be a qualifying offense. First, Appellant argues that the statute is clear and unambiguous, because it lists a large number of qualifying offenses, but not the crime of attempt. Appellant notes that the Legislature expressly included attempt in a prior version of the statute, but omitted it from the current version. Appellant asserts that if the Legislature had wished to include attempt in the current version, it could have simply imported that language from the prior version. In a similar vein, Appellant notes that when the Legislature passed the current version of § 6105, it also amended sections 6103 and 6104, and those sections expressly include attempt. Next, Appellant contends that the savings clause does not apply because under the prior laws of the Commonwealth, attempted burglary is not an offense “equivalent” to burglary (or any other offense on the § 6105 list).</p>

Throughout his brief, Appellant stresses that the statute should be read strictly, because a contrary reading that adds “attempt” to all substantive offenses would effectively double the number of qualifying offenses <em>sub silentio.</em>

      <em> </em>Appellant argues that it is the province of the Legislature, not this Court or any reviewing court, to amend the statute if it sees fit.

According to the Commonwealth, the Legislature enacted a host of changes to the Crimes Code and Judicial Code in 1995, all of which were intended to increase the deterrence and punishment of possession of illegal firearms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Commonwealth also notes that at the same time, the Legislature amended 18 Pa.C.S. § 905 to provide that in general, attempt carries the same sentencing grade as the most serious attempted offense. The Commonwealth contends that against this backdrop, the Legislature could not have possibly intended to omit attempt from the list of qualifying offenses under § 6105, particularly when attempt appeared in a prior version of the statute. In a somewhat puzzling argument, the Commonwealth next suggests that there may be a “latent ambiguity” in the savings clause of § 6105, and that attempt is incorporated into the clause by reference because attempted burglary is now “equivalent [to burglary] in the only way that matters, in terms of punishment.” <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>
    <p id="b1303-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1303.7",1303,[963,430,752,839]]]'>Next, the Commonwealth argues that the phrase “Section 3502 <em>(relating to </em>burglary)” must encompass attempted burglary as well. The Commonwealth reasons that if the Legislature had meant to include only the completed crime of burglary, it would have said “Section 3502 (burglary)”. Finally, the Commonwealth submits that if the statutory language is ambiguous, courts may turn to legislative history and other tools to discern the Legislature’s intent. On this basis, the Commonwealth again stresses that the Legislature could not possibly have intended to expand the class of offenders who are entitled to possess firearms.</p>

      <a id="p1270" href="#p1270" data-label="1270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1270</a>Here, the words of the statute are unambiguous. We first look to the list of enumerated offenses. Section 6105(b) lists 38 qualifying offenses, using a short description of the offense and the corresponding section number from the Crimes Code. Burglary, at 18 Pa.C.S. § 3502, is on the list. Importantly, § 3502 does not define burglary in a way that would also include attempted burglary. Section 3502 provides: “a person is guilty of burglary if he <em>enters </em>a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied portion thereof, with intent to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3502 (emphasis added). In other words, burglary is defined in terms of the completed criminal act, not a mere attempt to do so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Next, we observe that while burglary is on the list of enumerated offenses, attempt is plainly not.

As the trial court noted, the parenthetical phrases are included for convenience, so that the reader can easily see which crimes correspond to which numerical section of the Crimes Code. The Superior Court echoed this reasoning. Like the lower courts, we decline to read any greater significance into the parentheticals.</p>

By its plain language, the savings clause would apply if Appellant had been convicted, under a prior law of the Commonwealth, of an offense that is “equivalent” to burglary as currently set forth in § 3502.</p>

The sharp distinction the law has always drawn between commission of an act, here, burglary, and the attempt to commit the act, remains.
