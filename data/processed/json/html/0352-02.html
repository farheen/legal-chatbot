Brewer unlawfully furnished a schedule W drug, methamphetamine, in violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1106 (Supp.1996). On appeal, the State argues that the court erred when it held that Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA) agents seized Brewer without a reasonable suspicion <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>of criminal conduct in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Because we conclude that no seizure occurred when MDEA agents displayed their badges and approached Brewer as he sat in his parked vehicle, we vacate the order.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[218,530,756,836]]]'>[¶ 2] On August 11,1997, at approximately 1:45 p.m., undercover MDEA agents Peter Arno and Darrell Crandall were driving south in an unmarked ear on Route 1. Near the town line separating Blaine and Bridge-water, the agents approached a red pickup truck from behind. Brewer, the driver, and Frederick Noyes, the front seat passenger, occupied the truck. As they drove, both Brewer and Noyes appeared preoccupied with something between them on the seat. According to Crandall, the truck swerved in the lane about twenty times without crossing over into another lane or crossing over the fog line. Arno testified that the amount of times the track swerved “was out of the ordinary.” The truck also slowed down and accelerated in an erratic manner.</p>
    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[215,1396,756,654]]]'>[¶ 3] The agents followed the truck for one and a half to two miles into downtown Bridgewater. Brewer then turned right off Route 1 into a church parking lot. An unattended tractor trailer with its engine running was parked in front of the church, next to and parallel with Route 1. Brewer parked his truck to the right of and alongside the tractor trader so that the tractor trailer was parked between his truck and Route 1. By parking between the tractor trailer and the church, Brewer and Noyes partially concealed the truck from the sight of persons traveling along Route 1.</p>
    <p id="b408-6" data-blocks='[["BL_408.6",408,[215,2072,753,516]]]'>[¶ 4] After Brewer turned into the church parking lot, the agents continued along Route 1 for seventy-five to one hundred yards, where they parked on the side of the road. The agents sat in their parked vehicle for a few minutes and observed that Brewer and Noyes continued to be preoccupied with something between them on the seat. According to Crandall, Brewer and Noyes looked around “as if to see if there was somebody around them.”</p>

Arno drove back toward the church, pulled into the parking lot, and parked their unmarked car to the front and to the left of Brewer’s truck. The agents’ vehicle did not block Brewer’s truck.</p>
    <p id="b408-9" data-blocks='[["BL_408.9",408,[1022,399,748,515]]]'>[¶ 6] The agents, both wearing civilian clothes, exited their vehicle at the same time and approached Brewer’s truck. Crandall approached the driver’s side door and held up his MDEA badge to identify himself to Brewer. Arno approached the passenger’s side door and — when he was fifteen to twenty feet away from Noyes — pulled out and displayed his MDEA badge from a pouch on his waist pack. Noyes hurriedly exited the truck as Arno approached.</p>
    <p id="b408-10" data-blocks='[["BL_408.10",408,[1019,944,751,515]]]'>[¶ 7] Crandall observed that Brewer appeared dazed and that his pupils were constricted. On questioning by Crandall, Brewer said he had been drinking and that he had smoked marijuana earlier that day. Crandall then asked Brewer to step out of the truck, and he did. Crandall asked if Brewer had drugs in the truck, and he said yes. When Crandall asked if he could search the track, Brewer said “okay, go ahead, but it’s in my pocket,” and pulled out a bag of marijuana.</p>
    <p id="b408-11" data-blocks='[["BL_408.11",408,[1018,1489,750,653]]]'>[¶ 8] After Brewer produced the marijuana, Arno and Crandall searched the truck, where they found a mirror with white powder residue on it and two marijuana pipes. Arno then noticed a bulge in Brewer’s left front pocket, and asked him to empty his pockets. Brewer “fidget[ed] around with something” and produced a razor blade and straw. Brewer’s “fidgeting” led Arno to believe Brewer was concealing something in his pocket. Arno reached inside Brewer’s pocket and pulled out a plastic bag containing methamphetamine. The agents arrested Brewer.</p>
    <p id="b408-12" data-blocks='[["BL_408.12",408,[1015,2179,752,565]]]'>[¶ 9] Brewer was indicted for the unlawful furnishing of a scheduled drug, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1106 (1983 &amp; Supp.1998) and criminal forfeiture, 15 M.R.S.A. §§ 5821, 5826 (Supp.1998). Brewer filed, and the court granted, a motion to suppress all evidence seized by the agents. The court concluded that the agents seized Brewer when they displayed their badges and approached his vehicle and that the agents did not have a reasonable suspicion to justify the seizure. The State appealed.</p>

    <p id="b410-8" data-blocks='[["BL_410.10",410,[194,1524,755,324]]]'>[¶ 15] One relevant principle, stated in ¶ 10 is that: “We will not disturb a court’s decision as to whether a seizure implicates the Fourth Amendment unless we find errors of law or clearly erroneous findings of fact.” (citing <em>State v. Moulton, </em><a href="/a2d/704/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="1997 ME 228" data-case-ids="11872756" data-case-paths="/a2d/704/0361-01">1997 ME 228</a>, ¶ 6, <a href="/a2d/704/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="1997 ME 228" data-case-ids="11872756" data-case-paths="/a2d/704/0361-01">704 A.2d 361</a>, 363).</p>
    <p id="b410-9" data-blocks='[["BL_410.11",410,[189,1875,757,705]]]'>[¶ 16] The second relevant principle of law, stated in ¶ 11 is that: “An officer seizes a citizen *when “the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen” such that he is not free to walk away.’ ” (quoting <em>State v. Cilley, </em><a href="/a2d/707/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="1998 ME 34" data-case-ids="11851318" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0079-01">1998 ME 34</a>, ¶ 7, <a href="/a2d/707/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="1998 ME 34" data-case-ids="11851318" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0079-01">707 A.2d 79</a>, 82). At ¶ 12, the Court correctly clarifies what constitutes a seizure, “An officer’s interaction with a citizen constitutes a seizure when the officer’s conduct is accompanied by actions that lead a reasonable person to believe that he is not free to leave.” (citing <em>I.N.S. v. Delgado, </em><a href="/us/466/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="466 U.S. 210" data-case-ids="6196728" data-case-paths="/us/466/0210-01">466 U.S. 210</a>, 215, <a href="/us/466/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="466 U.S. 210" data-case-ids="6196728" data-case-paths="/us/466/0210-01">104 S.Ct. 1758</a>, <a href="/us/466/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="466 U.S. 210" data-case-ids="6196728" data-case-paths="/us/466/0210-01">80 L.Ed.2d 247</a> (1984)).</p>

One officer testified “probably my firearm was visible, but I couldn’t say that to be sure.” The Court could infer that the officers’ attitudes and bearing clearly indicated intention to confront and search the vehicle or its occupants. While reasonable views may differ, that is not our standard for review.</p>
    <p id="b410-12" data-blocks='[["BL_410.14",410,[998,777,751,699]]]'>[¶ 18] Notably, in <em>dlley, </em>in which we also overturned a trial court’s factual findings, the event involved the officers being in one place and the defendant coming to them, <em>alley, </em><a href="/a2d/707/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="1998 ME 34" data-case-ids="11851318" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0079-01">1998 ME 34</a>, ¶¶3-4, <a href="/a2d/707/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="1998 ME 34" data-case-ids="11851318" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0079-01">707 A.2d 79</a>, 80-81. Here, the evidence reasonably supports the trial court’s conclusion that the officers, aggressively heading towards the defendant, drawing and flashing their badges, and perhaps with a visible firearm, had a purpose in mind to stop and search the vehicle and its occupants. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that Brewer or any reasonable person, confronted with this show of authority, could have believed that he was free to leave.</p>
    <p id="b410-13" data-blocks='[["BL_410.15",410,[995,1514,750,374]]]'>[¶ 19] The trial court also found that there was no reasonable articulable suspicion to warrant a stop or seizure. “We have no weaving beyond the lane in question. We have an out-of-state plate, and we have parking beside the truck in daytime. So, therefore, the court finds that those facts do not warrant a stop.”</p>
    <p id="b410-14" data-blocks='[["BL_410.16",410,[992,1918,753,603]]]'>[¶ 20] There may be other evidence that might justify a seizure, but it is for the trial court, not this Court, to assess the credibility and sufficiency of that evidence. Even the MDEA agents did not think they had sufficient cause to stop the vehicle based on its operation, because they did not do so. They testified they saw no violation of law. The officers kept going when the vehicle pulled into a parking lot. Then they observed it, noting only activity that could have many innocent explanations, and then they confronted it.</p>

In the circumstances the trial court could have concluded that the facts may have been embellished and pretext used to justify what was an insupportable search and seizure. Because the motion to suppress was granted, findings on these supplemental believability points were not necessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The trial court made sufficient, supportable findings that the seizure was not justified.</p>

The Court’s function is to review the record to determine whether there is any evidence to support the trial court’s findings. <em>See VanVoorhees v.

Some trial courts are appropriately cautious about making believability findings regarding law enforcement officers and others who regularly appear before them as witnesses. This caution avoids bias concerns in future cases involving the same witness. Lack of a believability finding does not permit the inference that the court found a witness believable.</p>
