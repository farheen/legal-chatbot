The Davis vehicle, which was proceeding east on Fessenden St., (which runs in an east/west direction) struck Aguehounde in the crosswalk on the east side of Wisconsin Ave. Aguehounde testified that as he approached the Fessenden St./Wisconsin Ave. intersection, and when he was three or four steps from the southeast corner of that intersection, he looked to his left and did not see any vehicles approaching from the west on Fessenden Street. He further testified that when he reached the corner he saw that the light facing him was green and that cars, pointed in a westerly direction, were stopped to his right on Fessenden Street.

    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[213,478,753,1035]]]'>Before turning to the merits, a brief discussion of practices relating to the timing of traffic lights will be helpful to understanding the issue presented. The clearance interval of a traffic light is the amount of time allocated to the yellow light which occurs between the green light for one street and the green light for the cross street at an intersection. At some intersections an “all-red” sequence is added, meaning there is a red light in each direction at the same time for the duration of that sequence, which is ordinarily no more than one or two seconds. The purpose of the clearance interval is: (1) to allow a driver sufficient time to either come to a complete stop before entering the intersection or to clear the intersection before the crossing light turns green; and (2) to keep opposing traffic and pedestrians from entering the intersection until the vehicles headed in the opposite direction have passed through the intersection.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[208,1543,752,417]]]'>It is undisputed that in 1985 the clearance interval at the Wisconsin Ave./Fessenden St. intersection for traffic coming from Davis’s direction was 4.5 seconds, meaning the light facing traffic on Fessenden St. would turn from green to yellow for 4.5 seconds before the light facing traffic on Wisconsin Ave. would turn to green. In October 1989, the interval was changed to 4.0 seconds.</p>
    <p id="b504-7" data-blocks='[["BL_504.8",504,[211,1984,747,181]]]'>The principal formula used by the District in setting the timing of traffic light intervals is contained in the chart “Required Yellow Interval In Seconds,” which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b504-8" data-blocks='[["BL_504.9",504,[379,2175,413,32]]]'>Y = T + <em>% </em>V + (W + L)</blockquote>

    <p id="b504-13" data-blocks='[["BL_504.14",504,[1009,233,751,1429]]]'>The factor “Y” is the clearance interval expressed in seconds. “T” represents the “perception reaction time,” which is the time it takes a driver to perceive the yellow light and react to it by moving his foot from the accelerator to the brake, and for braking to begin. The “accepted figure” for “T” is one second. The second part of the formula <em>Qfi </em>“V” divided by “A”) calculates the “accepted deceleration rate for a controlled stop” with “V” being the velocity of the vehicle, expressed in feet per second, and “A” representing the deceleration rate of a vehicle, expressed in feet per second per second. The speed limit at the intersection was 25 mph or 36.7 feet per second. Typical “A” values vary from 10, for a “fairly fast stop,” to 15 for a “more conservative, comfortable stop.” The third part of the formula computes the time it would take a car to clear the intersection. This is done by adding the width of the intersection (“W”) to the length of the car (“L”) and dividing by the velocity at which the car is traveling in feet per second (“V”). In general, 12 feet is used as the “L” for automobiles, and a larger number is used for longer vehicles such as trucks. In applying this formula, the greater the speed, the shorter the clearance interval and vice versa.</p>

At trial, Ague-hounde’s traffic engineering expert, Sheldon Pivnik, testified that the width of the intersection, “W”, in the clearance interval formula used by the District <em>(see </em>discussion, <em>supra </em>at 446-447), must be determined by measuring from the stop line beyond the crosswalk at one side of the intersection to the corresponding stop line at the other side of the intersection. Using that definition of “W”, the width of Wisconsin avenue is 106 feet. Thus argues Aguehounde, because the clearance interval was originally set at 4.5 seconds at the Fessenden/Wiseonsin intersection, the District must have mis-measured the width since a “W” value of 65 feet, rather than the <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>correct 106 feet, would result in an interval of 4.5 seconds.</p>

The District subsequently filed a cross-claim against both of the Davises, seeking contribution for Erica Davis's actions. On May 3, 1993, the court granted Aguehounde’s motion to dismiss the Davises as defendants. However, because of the District’s pending cross-claim against the Davises, the court decided to submit an advisory interrogatory to the jury on Erica Davis’s negligence. The jury returned an advisory verdict against Davis, concluding that she had been negligent. The jury’s conclusion was rejected by the trial court in an order filed on June 9, 1993, in which the court found that the evidence showed that Davis was not negligent and that Aguehounde was negligent.

Therefore, the District was immune from liability flowing from its failure to locate a traffic control device at what was concededly a very dangerous intersection. Consequently, we conclude that <em>Urow, </em>not <em>Cope, </em>controls our analysis relating to the timing of the interval of a traffic control device.

In fact, as the District points out, the trial judge only struck the portion of the engineer's testimony setting out the specific charts or formulae the previous District engineer had used in setting the interval; "[wjhat was stricken was his report about what the other engineer had done before this time.” The engineer’s testimony regarding the existence and use of several other charts, however, was not stricken from the record. Moreover, the trial court specifically noted that while the engineer may "not have been able competently to state what was in the [previous] engineer’s mind when he made the decision, he was competent to state that other charts were in use.” Finally, even if evidence of other charts was not admissable for consideration by the jury, the trial court, as fact-finder on the discretionary/ministerial function issue could, as we said above, properly consider it.</p>

If the same factors used by Aguehounde’s expert were used with a "W” of 65 feet rather than the 106 feet, the result would be an interval of 2.1 seconds, rather than 3.2 seconds (using 106 feet), in the third part of the standard formula.

There may perhaps appear to be some intuitive merit in the trial judge’s assessment of what factors engineers do or should consider in determining the duration of the clearance interval. But if the factors enumerated by the judge, or any of them, are a part of the prescribed or actual calculus, the District had ample opportunity to adduce evidence proving this to be the case. The District failed altogether to do so, however, and instead presented testimony that the interval was either arbitrarily fixed at four seconds as a matter of routine (according to Ghaman) or selected, in this case, as a result of a measuring error (according to Gyani).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_11" id="ref_footnote_2_11">11</a>
