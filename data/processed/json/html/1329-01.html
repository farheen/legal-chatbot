Respondent Slosberg’s August 1993 affidavit did not inform the Board or the court that he had no such clients, adverse parties, or tribunals within the District, nor did it supply information concerning other jurisdictions or administrative agencies before which he was admitted to practice, information which was “already known” in Gardner. <a href="/a2d/650/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="650 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11328633" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0693-01">650 A.2d at 697, n. 7</a>.

The opinion also conditions the retroactive suspension upon the attorney’s having promptly “notifiefd] Bar Counsel of any professional disciplinary action in another jurisdiction, as he or she is required to do under Rule XI § 18(1).... ” The requirement of notification is now contained in Rule XI, § 11(b): ”[A]ny attorney subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court, upon being subjected to professional disciplinary action by a disciplining court outside the District of Columbia or by another court in the District of Columbia, shall promptly inform Bar Counsel of such action.”</p>

An attorney can be expected to ascertain on his or her own the provisions of our disciplinary rules, especially when the order of suspension particularly calls the § 14 requirements to the attorney’s attention. Indeed, Board Rule 8.6, enclosed with the executive attorney’s letter along with a copy of § 11, makes specific mention of the need, in the event of a temporary suspension under Rule XI, § 11(d), for the filing of an "Affidavit of Compliance with Section 14 of Rule XI” with the Court and the Board Office, and a copy sent to Bar Counsel. Nonetheless, it might be advisable for the letter form the executive attorney to be modified so as to make clear that the affidavit called for by the letter is to meet the criteria of <em>In re Goldberg </em>and is not the affidavit required by § 14.</p>

The thrust of <em>Goldberg, </em>in this respect, is that if a respondent wishes a reciprocal suspension in the District of Columbia to run concurrently with a suspension elsewhere, the respondent should inform the court, by means of an appropriate showing, that he or she has not practiced in the District of Columbia while suspended in the other jurisdiction. In the usual case, it will be most practical to make that showing by affidavit. It is for this reason, apparently, that Bar Counsel referred to "the affidavit required by <em>In re Goldberg," </em>even though our opinion in <em>Goldberg </em>did not require the filing of an affidavit.</p>

We assume that respondent did not resume the practice of law in the District of Columbia during the period August 24-November 24, 1994. If this assumption is not correct, counsel should promptly inform the Board, Bar Counsel, and the court.</p>
