    <p class="author" id="b923-8" data-blocks='[["BL_923.9",923,[225,1104,494,39]]]'>KRAMER, Associate Judge:</p>
    <p id="b923-9" data-blocks='[["BL_923.10",923,[184,1170,756,1488]]]'>This case began with a complaint filed in the Small Claims Branch of the Superior Court, where appellee, Sirage Mustafa, sued appellant, Diane Oliver (the owner of a rooming house where Mr. Mustafa had lived), for the recovery of his $400 security deposit and $543, the estimated value of a few items of Mr. Mustafa’s property that Ms. Oliver had confiscated and disposed of without his permission. Ultimately, the complaint was amended to include additional counts, and the case was transferred to a regular civil calendar. There a default was entered against Ms. Oliver, who had never actually filed an answer to the complaint. At the conclusion of a jury trial that addressed solely the issue of Mr. Mustafa’s damages, a jury awarded Mr. Mustafa $11,826 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages. The trial court separately awarded Mr. Musta-fa $211,350 in attorneys’ fees. On appeal, Ms. Oliver argues that the trial court erred in ordering a default on the claims that underlay the jury’s award, in instructing the jury on punitive damages, in declining to permit the admission of certain evidence and in awarding attorneys’ fees. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b923-10" data-blocks='[["BL_923.11",923,[984,253,754,561]]]'>The factual background is as follows. In December 2001, Mr. Mustafa rented a room in a house owned and run by Ms. Oliver. They entered into an oral agreement by which Mr. Mustafa paid a $400 security deposit plus $400 per month in rent. After she accepted his deposit and first month’s rent, Ms. Oliver informed Mr. Mustafa that tenants who stayed in the house for less than three months forfeited their security deposits.</p>
    <p id="b923-11" data-blocks='[["BL_923.12",923,[983,840,757,1342]]]'>After he moved in, Mr. Mustafa found the building to be grossly unsanitary, insecure, and the site of drug use, drug sales, and prostitution. The front door was frequently unlocked, and it was not unusual for homeless persons and drug addicts to enter and sleep in the hallway. The common bathroom was in a state of disrepair. Since it was used by drug users to get high and by prostitutes to service their clients, the sink was often clogged with needles and condoms. When an employee of Ms. Oliver’s fixed up the bathroom for $600, she fired him for wasting her money. Drug users and prostitutes also used the common hallways for them activities. The kitchen was in the basement of the building, and was infested with vermin. Mr. Mustafa testified that he would take a few steps down the stairway, and then wait a few seconds before proceeding to let the rats and mice “situate themselves” in a corner. The kitchen was also directly below the bathroom, and flushing the toilet would result in raw sewage overflowing and dripping into the kitchen.</p>
    <p id="b923-12" data-blocks='[["BL_923.13",923,[986,2208,755,456]],["BL_924.1",924,[200,256,753,351]]]'>The police were summoned to the building on a regular basis. Mr. Mustafa complained to Ms. Oliver in private about the conditions of the house and the criminal behavior he witnessed. In July of 2002, soon after he complained to her about his co-tenants, they confronted him, saying that he had been labeled a “snitch,” leading him to deduce that Ms. Oliver had told <a id="p876" href="#p876" data-label="876" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*876</a>them of his complaints. He feared for his personal safety, and began to invite friends to spend the night so he would not be alone in his room. It was this “snitch” incident that made him finally resolve to move out, and he informed Ms. Oliver that he would leave at the end of July.</p>
    <p id="b924-4" data-blocks='[["BL_924.5",924,[197,635,756,1072]]]'>On the day he was removing his possessions, Mr. Mustafa requested his security deposit in exchange for his key. Ms. Oliver refused to return the deposit. Thus, Mr. Mustafa had a new lock installed on his door. Thereafter, he left for a short time “to seek available legal remedies to his problem” with Ms. Oliver. While he was gone, Ms. Oliver had his new lock changed and confiscated the few remaining items of his property in this room. These items included a color television, antenna, coffee maker, telephone, answering machine, and dining room chair. Upon his return, Ms. Oliver refused to allow him access to his room or his property, and again refused to return his $400 security deposit. Without the security deposit, Mr. Mustafa lacked the funds to obtain other housing, and was thus homeless for three months.</p>
    <p id="b924-5" data-blocks='[["BL_924.6",924,[191,1743,759,916]]]'>On October 15, 2002, Mr. Mustafa filed a complaint in the Small Claims Branch of the Superior Court. A default judgment was entered against Ms. Oliver awarding Mr. Mustafa $943. The default judgment was vacated on July 7, 2003, however, after she successfully contested service of the complaint. Mr. Mustafa then filed an amended complaint in the same court on July 18, 2003, alleging unlawful eviction, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, breach of the implied warranty of habitability/constructive eviction, conversion of personal property, intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, retaliatory action, failure to refund security deposit, and failure to provide required documentation.</p>
    <p id="b924-6" data-blocks='[["BL_924.7",924,[1001,257,751,1185]]]'>The action was transferred from the Small Claims Court to the Civil Division. On April 7, 2004, based on Ms. Oliver’s repeated failure to appear at scheduled hearings and to comply with discovery, Judge Michael Rankin issued a second order of default. This order was vacated <em>sua sponte </em>the next month and discovery proceeded again. Subsequently, when Mr. Mustafa’s counsel attempted to interview the other tenants at the building, Ms. Oliver interfered. When the tenants spoke to counsel elsewhere, she evicted them all the following day. Indeed, one tenant testified in a deposition that Ms. Oliver repeatedly called him and told him not to respond to his subpoena. Because of these actions, Judge Rankin imposed a temporary restraining order against Ms. Oliver, enjoining her from contacting potential witnesses to influence their testimony, evicting anyone from the house, or destroying any documents that had been requested.</p>
    <p id="b924-7" data-blocks='[["BL_924.8",924,[1000,1474,747,187]]]'>At the hearing granting this order, Judge Rankin summoned a marshal to keep Ms. Oliver from interrupting him. He then stated:</p>

And so you clearly, very clearly, are aware of court processes, such as the time the Court starts, such as the need to respond to pleadings, such as the impropriety of appearing after the other side has been here and gone and then attempting <em>ex parte </em>argument with the Court on substantive issues affecting the case....

    <p id="b925-6" data-blocks='[["BL_925.7",925,[180,709,756,1384]]]'>Thereafter, Ms. Oliver obtained counsel as advised by Judge Rankin. Despite explicit testimony at her deposition that she possessed requested documents and knew where they were, she subsequently answered discovery requests with assertions that requested documents were lost, destroyed, or never existed. On October 18, 2005, a third default was entered against Ms. Oliver, and the matter was set down for a jury trial before Judge Maurice Ross on the issue of damages alone, liability having been established by the default. On January 11, 2006, at the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded Mr. Mustafa $11,826 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages. Ms. Oliver filed no post-trial motions contesting this award. The trial court granted Mr. Mus-tafa’s unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees on March 8, 2006, finding by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Oliver litigated in bad faith, and awarding Mr. Mustafa attorneys’ fees in the amount of $211,850. Ms. Oliver thereafter filed a motion to reconsider, which was subsequently denied.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b925-8" data-blocks='[["BL_925.9",925,[186,2253,752,401]]]'>Ms. Oliver argues that Judge Rankin erred in entering a default against her. We find no merit in this claim. Never at any time during the entire course of this litigation did Ms. Oliver file an answer to Mr. Mustafa’s complaint. In ordering the default, Judge Rankin explained that because of Ms. Oliver’s actions,</p>

And so now, he’s again asking for the entry of a default as an acknowledgment, <em>not as a sanction, </em>but as an acknowledgment of the defendant’s <em>failure to participate. </em>Her participation [up to] now has been limited to having a pretty good lawyer come in and defend her lack of participation. That’s unacceptable.</blockquote>
    <p id="b925-10" data-blocks='[["BL_925.11",925,[981,778,756,1079]]]'>(Emphasis added). It is clear that while Judge Rankin may have had several legitimate bases to enter another default, Ms. Oliver’s failure to file an answer at any time served as an indisputably legitimate ground for that default. Super Ct. Civ. R. 12(a)(5), 55(a). Indeed, when a defendant never files an answer, Rule 12(a)(5) mandates default, even if the defendant has “otherwise defended” her position. <em>Restaurant Equip. &amp; Supply Depot, Inc. v.

She contended, however, that a default based on failure to answer a complaint requires the plaintiff to <em>prove </em>a prima facie case in order to obtain damages, unlike a default entered as a discovery sanction, which merely requires the plaintiff to <em>allege </em>a prima facie case. The distinction that she attempts to make between the necessity of proof and the sufficiency of factual allegations constituting a prima facie case is not supported by our case law. As we stated in <em>Hudson v. Ashley, </em>“a defendant’s default does not in <a id="p878" href="#p878" data-label="878" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*878</a>itself warrant the court in entering a default judgment.

Here, in granting an unop<a id="p880" href="#p880" data-label="880" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*880</a>posed motion for attorneys’ fees, Judge Ross found by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Oliver had litigated in bad faith. Ms. Oliver subsequently filed a motion to reconsider, which Judge Ross denied, finding by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Oliver “repeatedly violated the rules for written discovery, tampered with or intimidated witnesses, and failed to file an answer, and that these violations prejudiced Plaintiff beyond what an entry of default could cure.” On appeal, Ms. Oliver does not address this finding other than to insist that all of her actions were in good faith. The record provides ample justification for Judge Ross’ finding and we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>

This pertained to events that occurred in April of 2004, almost two years after Mr. Mustafa had moved out of the house, when his counsel attempted to speak with the tenants then living there and Ms. Oliver refused to grant counsel access for that purpose. Later, when the tenants spoke with counsel elsewhere, they were all summarily evicted. Mr. Mustafa then sought an injunction to keep Ms. Oliver from evicting his witnesses in retaliation for their anticipated testimony. Ms. Oliver claims that the injunction showed an inconsistency in Mr. Mustafa’s story; that is, when he lived in the house, he faulted her for permitting criminals to occupy it, but later, when she tried to evict these purportedly same criminals, he tried to stop her.</p>

Since the events took place long after Mr. Mustafa had moved from the house, we conclude that Judge Ross in no way erred by concluding that this evidence was irrelevant and precluding its admission. “The determination of what evidence is relevant, and what evidence may tend to confuse the jury, is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.” <em>Caulfield v.

Ms. Oliver further argues that evidence was nevertheless required for Mr. Mustafa’s allegation that she had told his housemates that he was a "snitch,” because the allegation in the complaint was based on information and belief. Mr. Mustafa testified at the damages hearing that he told no one but Ms. Oliver about his housemates' criminal activity, yet he was still confronted as a "snitch." Thus, the juiy was entitled to draw the logical inference that Ms. Oliver was the source of the co-tenants' knowledge. In any event, because this allegation was not included in the stipulated facts read to the juiy, we see the point as moot.</p>

In any event, on the facts here instruction to the jury concerning which claims justified a punitive damage award would appear unnecessary. Any of Ms. Oliver’s acts which meet the “willful, wanton, or malicious” standard for punitive damages were undoubtedly also part of the outrageous conduct which constituted the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and thus any malicious breach of contract assumed the character of an intentional tort. <em>Bernstein v.
