Oral argument on the motion was held March 3,1981. After considering the arguments, brief and memo-randa, we are of the opinion that the underlying controversy has become moot and, therefore, the petition for certiorari is denied and dismissed, and the writ of certiora-ri heretofore issued is hereby quashed.</p>
