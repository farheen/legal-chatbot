Knight (Appellees), preliminary objections to Appellants’ Amended Complaint in their action for fraud arising from a commercial real estate transaction. Appellants claim that they properly pled a claim for fraud based on an affirmative misrepresentation and a failure to disclose a material fact, notwithstanding an integration clause in the contract for sale, and therefore, the trial court erred in granting Appellees’ preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>

Appellants attached a copy of the Agreement to their Amended Complaint. The Agreement, which is only two pages in length, contains a space entitled “Special Clauses” on the first page. Under this heading are five typewritten clauses. Clause C states that the “Seller shall warrant Water Pipes to Motel Units.” Clause D states that “Buyer is Buying Property in as is Condition.” On the second page of the Agreement, the final paragraph is entitled “Representations” and it states in bold print:</p>

Knight regarding any potential problems with [the] aforementioned property and that Defendant indicated that there were no problems.” This is the only affirmative misrepresentation averred by Appellants. Furthermore, Appellants do not build upon this averment and do not mention it again throughout the remainder of the Amended Complaint.</p>

Considering that this cost is a significant percentage of the overall purchase price of $170,000, and that it was necessary to perform the work to use the property, and resolving any doubt in favor of Appellants, we conclude that the existence of the sewer defect was a fact basic to the transaction.</p>

Appellants’ assumption of this risk is reflected in two provisions of the Agreement. First, there is the typewritten clause stating that Appellants were purchasing the property “as is.” This is part of a provision in which National Bank, as the seller, warranted the condition of the water pipes to the motel. And if there was any doubt that the bank was not making any other warranties, the final paragraph of the Agreement states that Appellants have “agreed to purchase it in its present condition unless otherwise specified herein.” Thus, through their bargaining, the parties agreed that the bank would warrant the condition of one part of the .property (the water pipes to the motel), but that Appellants would accept the remainder of the property in its present condition and without warranty.</p>
    <p id="b591-10" data-blocks='[["BL_591.10",591,[947,1322,754,714]]]'>¶ 31 Second, the Agreement also states that Appellants either inspected the property or waived the right to do so. Further, they agreed that they were purchasing the property as a result of the inspection and not in reliance upon any representations made by Appellees. Ap-pellees do not allege that they had the property professionally inspected, as is common in real estate transactions, and that the defective sewer was undetectable due to its latency. Instead, they aver that the defect “was not readily apparent to a layperson.” However,</p>

Rather, they proceeded on the basis that there were no problems with the property because no defects were readily apparent to them. And that was not wise.</p>

This Court has observed that in order to comply with Pa. R.C.P. 1019(b), which states that “[a]ver-ments of fraud ... shall be averred with particularity,” the plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to enable the defendant to prepare a defense. <em>See McGinn v. Valloti, </em><a href="/pa-super/363/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="363 Pa.

In my view, Appellants’ complaint satisfies Rule. 1019(b) because the allegation that Ms. Knight advised Appellants that there were no problems with the property was sufficient to permit Appellees to prepare a defense.</p>
    <p id="b592-12" data-blocks='[["BL_592.13",592,[1007,1008,752,1024]]]'>¶ 3 Turning to the merits of Appellants’ substantive argument, the majority correctly observes that Appellants seek to invoke the “real estate inspection” exception to the parol evidence rule, which originated in <em>LeDonne v. Kessler, </em><a href="/pa-super/256/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="256 Pa.

In that case, the plaintiffs purchased a house and subsequently instituted an action in trespass against the sellers, asserting that they had agreed to buy the home in reliance upon the sellers’ fraudulent misrepresentations that the septic system had been repaired and that the sundeck and cellar had no leaks. The plaintiffs further alleged that shortly after they moved into the house, the septic system malfunctioned and the sundeck and the cellar began to leak water, damaging numerous items of personal property.</p>
    <p id="b592-13" data-blocks='[["BL_592.14",592,[1007,2059,750,610]],["BL_593.1",593,[152,258,754,349]]]'>¶4 The sellers filed preliminary objections in the nature of a <em>demurrer </em>and requested summary judgment, arguing that the parol evidence rule barred the plaintiffs from prosecuting the action. Specifically, the sellers asserted that the plaintiffs could not prevail because the sixth paragraph of the agreement of sale provided, “The parties have full knowledge of the physical appearance of the land and buildings and of the value thereof and there are no verbal representations as to <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>character or quality.” <em>Id. </em>at 1126. The trial court interpreted this language “as a complete integration clause which barred testimony of <em>all </em>oral representations concerning the ... transaction,” <em>id. </em>at 1129, and granted summary judgment in favor of the sellers.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[152,657,755,1086]]]'>¶ 5 When the plaintiffs appealed, this Court affirmed in part and vacated in part, reasoning that the language cited by the trial court “only deni[ed] the existence of verbal representations as to the character or quality of land and building conditions reasonably apparent from an inspection of the premises.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Consistent with that view, we held that the plaintiffs were precluded from offering testimony regarding “pre-agreement representations concerning the quality and condition of the sundeck and cellar” because there was evidence that the plaintiffs visually inspected those areas before signing the agreement, and they detected signs of water leakage. <em>Id. </em>at 1130. However, with respect to the septic system, we concluded that the plaintiffs could sustain their cause of action based on the following rationale:</p>

They observed a purported drainage field, but this observation would not reasonably put them on notice that the subterranean septic system still malfunctioned. Indeed, the opposite inference would be more logical. Because [the plaintiffs] could not discern through visual inspection alone the existence of the septic system problem of which they now complain, the wording of paragraph six does not bar the admission of evidence of [the sellers’] alleged misrepresentations concerning septic system problems.</blockquote>

However, the agreement of sale provided that Appellants agreed to purchase the property without relying “upon any representation made by the Seller ... or by any Agent [of the Seller] .... ” Agreement of Sale, 7/17/01, at 2. Moreover, the agreement contained an integration clause, and it provided that Appellants agreed to purchase the property in its “present condition,” <em>Id. </em>Thus, the present case is clearly distinguishable from <em>LeDonne, <a href="/pa-super/256/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="256 Pa.
