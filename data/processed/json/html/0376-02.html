Greer brought a negligence action against the City of Philadelphia, PennDOT, Green, and Green’s parent company, Fischbach &amp; Moore. CTS and Devlin were joined as additional defendants. Greer settled his claim with Devlin prior to trial. The case proceeded to a jury trial against the remainder of the defendants in January 1998. Before the jury began deliberations, the trial court granted motions for non-suit filed by the City of Philadelphia and Fischbach &amp; Moore. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Greer and against PennDOT, Green, and CTS in the amount of $2.5 million.

Specifically, the jury awarded Greer $2.5 million. From that verdict, the trial court deducted Devlin’s $100,000 settlement and $300,000 for Greer’s 12% negligence, and found PennDot, Devlin, Green, and CTS each 22% negligent, thus making their share of the verdict $462,000 each ($2.5 million less than $400,000 x .22). As such, PennDot was liable for 22% of the verdict or $462,000, but because it was entitled to indemnification by CTS for 22% of the verdict, PennDot’s liability was offset completely as was Green’s for the same reason.

In the parties’ contract, the station owners agreed to indemnify the contractor “from any and all claims for loss, damage, injury or other casualty ... caused or occasioned by any ... explosion ... occurring ... by reason of the ... installation and/or repair of’ the tanks. <a href="/pa/527/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="527 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1827724" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0001-01">588 A.2d at 3</a>. When one of the tanks to be installed arrived at the site with a hole, a resulting explosion injured a third party who had been hired by the contractor. The contractor was found to be 84% negligent and sought indemnity from the gas station owners pursuant to the contract. In spite of the broad language in the indemnity provision, this Court held that the agreement did not provide indemnity to the contractor for its own negligence, reaffirming the rule previously announced in <em>Perry v.

Contrary to their assertions, the language of the indemnity provision in no way demonstrates an unambiguous intention by CTS to provide indemnification for the negh-gence of the indemnitees, as required by the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule. By agreeing to language stating that PennDOT and Green were indemnified for damages <em>“only to the extent that” </em>the damages were caused by the neghgence of CTS and its sub-subcontractors, employees and anyone for whom it may be liable, the parties communicated their intent to limit any indemnification to that portion of damages attributed to the neghgence of CTS and those under its supervision. The chosen language simply does not evince an intent to provide indemnification for damages due to the neghgence of other unspecified parties, including an indemnitee. Moreover, we read the sec<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>ond part of the provision, which states that the indemnity clause will apply “regardless of whether or not such claim ... is caused in whole or in part by a party indemnified hereunder,” merely to clarify that any contributory negligence by PennDOT and Green will not bar their indemnification for damages due to CTS’s negligence.</p>

However, Green’s interpretation, the broader of the two, ignores the plain language of the indemnity provision, which confers indemnity <em>“only to the extent” </em>that the damages and/or claims are caused in whole or in part by the negligence of CTS or its agents. In fact, when Green argues that the indemnity provision is unambiguous, it tellingly excludes the “to the extent” language from its quotation of the contractual provision. Instead, it asserts: “The language of the indemnity provision specifically presents the circumstances in which indemnity will be required. Those circumstances are when the claim is caused <em>‘in whole or in part by the negligent acts or omissions of the Subcontractor.’ </em>” Green Brief at 10 (emphasis in original). However, this is simply not what the indemnity provision says. It does not state that Green and PennDOT are completely indemnified “when” or “if’ CTS is negligent. Rather, it states that they are indemnified <em>“to the extent” </em>that CTS is negligent. Despite Green’s attempt to discount the “to the extent” language, that language is in the plain text of the contract and clearly must be given effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

PennDOT Brief at 11-12 (“[T]he ultimate question for disposition by the court is really only what effect should be given to the indemnification clause’s ‘but only to the extent’ phrase.”) As stated above, PennDOT argues that the phrase limits CTS’s assumption of Penn-DOT’s and Green’s liability to an amount equal to that for which CTS, its sub-subcontractors and employees were independently hable.</p>

Significantly, however, courts in other jurisdictions that have considered virtually identical language to that used in the indemnity provision here have concluded, as we do now, that the clause provides indemnity only for the amount of damage caused by the indemnitor’s negligence, and not for damages attributable to the indemnitee’s negligence. While Penn-DOT calls the analysis in these cases “unsophisticated and simplistic,” PennDOT Brief at 35, we find the cases to be persuasive evidence that the interpretation Penn-DOT advocates is anything but the clear and unambiguous meaning of the contractual language. In particular, in <em>Hagerman Construction Corp. v.

At a minimum, the indemnity provision provides PennDOT and Green with an additional means of recovering any amount they might be compelled to pay on account of CTS’s negligence.

Accordingly, the trial court held that there was ample evidence to support <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the imposition of direct liability on all three parties.</p>

PennDOT urges us to "reject <em>Ruzzi’s </em>anachronistic views,” PennDOT Brief at 37, and instead to embrace "the most modern, most reasonable, and best and most correct approach,” <em>id. </em>at 41, which, in its view, is to no longer subject provisions allegedly providing for indemnification of a party for its own negligence to "strict scrutiny.” <em>Id. </em>at 37-38. This argument is curious given PennDOT’s assertion elsewhere in its brief that Pennsylvania is in the minority of states that do not statutorily <em>prohibit </em>either indemnification generally or indemnification of a party for its own negligence. <em>See id. </em>at 27 n. 20. In any event, we do not believe that <em>Ruzzi’s </em>rule is "anachronistic,” but rather, continue to believe that it is a sound rule, carefully designed to ensure that no party is unwittingly subjected to liability that we have characterized as "hazardous ... unusual and extraordinary.” <em>Perry, </em><a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. at 557</a>.</p>

Under either approach, the resulting indemnification would be the same in light of the unique circumstances of this case, where PennDOT, Green and CTS were each found to be 22% liable. Namely, CTS would be saddled with 66% of the damages in an incident in which it was only 22% negligent.</p>

Although Green characterizes the indemnification provision in that case as being "essentially similar” to the language at issue here, Green Brf. at 10, the provision did not contain the "to the extent” limitation present in the CTS Contract, but rather simply provided for indemnification for damages "caused in whole or in part by” the indemnitor’s negligence. Because we disagree that the "to the extent” language can be, or should be, overlooked, we decline to employ <em>Hershey’s </em>analysis here.</p>

Even without applying the rules of strict construction that are employed under Kansas law when an indemnitee is seeking indemnification for its own negligence, that court concluded that the "to the extent” language limited the indemnitor’s liability to that portion of the attorney’s fees and costs that corresponded to the percentage of fault attributed to it for the plaintiff's injuries.</p>

This would be particularly meaningful in a situation in which a plaintiff brings a negligence action against PennDOT, Green, and CTS, and a jury finds CTS’s negligence to be the sole cause of plaintiff's injuries. Under the indemnity provision, CTS would then be obligated to reimburse Green and PennDOT for all of their attorney’s fees and costs in defending the action.</p>
