    <p id="p-13">Joseph Hopkins ("Hopkins") and Delancey Abstract Corporation ("Delancey") (collectively, "Appellants") appeal the judgment entered against them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We affirm.</p>
    <p id="p-14">The trial court entered the following findings of fact:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-15">1. This lawsuit arises from a dispute concerning real property purchased by Plaintiff [John Kessock, Jr.] on or about April 18, 2005, with a physical address of 1333 Beaumont Drive, Gladwyne, PA 19035 (hereinafter, the "Subject Property").</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-16">2. Defendant Conestoga was the title insurance underwriter for the Subject Property.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-17">3. Plaintiff's claim stems from a breach of Conestoga's obligations to disclose an easement, as part of its title agency services, when Plaintiff purchased the Subject Property.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-18">4. The recorded easement was discovered by Plaintiff after the completion of the sale of the Subject Property.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-19">5. Thereafter, Plaintiff made a title insurance claim with Conestoga, alleging his claim was worth in excess of $1,000,000. Conestoga denied the insurance claim.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-20">6. Additional Defendant Delancey, a now non-operating Pennsylvania corporate entity, was a title insurance broker.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-21">7. Delancey was the title agent who conducted the closing for the Subject Property.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-22">8. Additional Defendant Hopkins was the principal of Delancey.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-23">9. Security Search and Abstract Company, Inc. ("Security Abstract") was the agent hired by Delancey to actually conduct the title search for the Subject Property.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-24">10. Additional Defendant Hopkins and Schafkopf is a law firm which provided no services related to this case even though Hopkins' name appears in the firm's name.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-25">11. On April 21, 2004, Conestoga entered into an agency agreement with Delancey (the "Agency Agreement").</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-26">12. Paragraph 5 of the Agency Agreement provides:</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-27">Agent agrees to be solely liable and indemnify Conestoga for all attorneys'</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-28"><a id="p1050" href="#p1050" data-label="1050" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1050</a>fees, court costs, expenses and loss or aggregate of losses resulting from shortages in its escrow accounts, fraud, negligence or misconduct of its agents, its officers, or employees in the issuance of title insurance. Agent agrees that Conestoga shall have full control of the determination, procedure and final decision of all losses including the defense thereof. Conestoga agrees to consult with Agent prior to making any final decision on losses on policies issued by Agent.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-29">13. The Agency Agreement was executed under seal by Hopkins on behalf of Delancey.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-30">14. Also on April 21, 2004, Hopkins executed a "Guaranty of Payment and Performance" in which Hopkins personally guaranteed Delancey's performance of the Agency Agreement, including "indemnifications and claims of loss as set forth in the Agency Agreement (the "Guaranty").</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-31">15. The Guaranty was not executed under seal by Hopkins.</blockquote>
    <p id="p-32">Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at 2-3.</p>
    <p id="p-33">The trial court summarized the procedural history of this case as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-34">On December 16, 2008 Plaintiff John Kessock, Jr. ("Plaintiff") commenced this action by filing a Complaint against Conestoga Title Insurance Co. ("Conestoga") and Security Abstract. On June 12, 2009, an Amended Complaint was filed. Pursuant to an Order dated January 19, 2010, Security Abstract's Preliminary Objections were sustained, and it was dismissed as a party. Conestoga filed a motion to join Delancey, Hopkins, and the Law Offices of Hopkins &amp; Schafkopf, LLC ("Hopkins &amp; Schafkopf") as additional defendants on May 19, 2011. That motion was granted on June 5, 2012, entered of record on June 6, 2012.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-35">On November 9, 2016, a two-day non-jury trial on liability was conducted. In an Order dated November 18, 2016, upon consideration of the evidence presented, and after granting Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Directed Verdict, this [c]ourt ultimately found in favor of Conestoga and against Plaintiff. Further, on the crossclaims asserted by Conestoga against Appellants and Hopkins &amp; Schafkopf, the [c]ourt found in favor of Conestoga and against Delancey and Hopkins only on its claim for attorney's fees and costs. A compulsory nonsuit/directed verdict was granted to Hopkins &amp; Schafkopf.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-36">An additional two-day non-jury trial on damages was conducted beginning on May 1, 2017 on the singular issue of the assessment of attorney's fees. On August 17, 2017 this [c]ourt issued its decision with seventeen pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law. On October 12, 2017, this [c]ourt denied Appellant[s'] motion for post-trial relief.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-37">On October 17, 2017 Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal to this [c]ourt's October 12, 2017 Order denying Appellant[s'] motion for post-trial relief.<sup>[</sup><a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> <sup>]</sup> On November 6, 2017, pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(b), this [c]ourt Ordered Appellants to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal within 21 days.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-38">Appellants filed their Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal on November 27, 2017. In their Concise Statement, Appellants claim, in more specific detail, that the trial court erred in: (1) allowing the joinder of [A]ppellants, (2) not finding in favor of Appellants, <a id="p1051" href="#p1051" data-label="1051" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1051</a>and (3) the [c]ourt's calculation of attorney's fees.</blockquote>
    <p id="p-39">Trial Court Opinion, 12/1/17, at 1-2.</p>
    <p id="p-40">On appeal, Appellants present the following questions for our review:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-41">A. Appellee Conestoga Title Insurance Company filed two successive motions to join Appellants Joseph Hopkins and Delancey Abstract Corporation as additional defendants, filed 431 days and 1,270 days after the joinder period of Pa.R.C.P. No. 2253 expired. And Conestoga's attorneys falsely represented to the Trial Court in both motions that they had just discovered Hopkins' and Delancey's potential liability. Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion in granting the joinder motions?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-42">B. Appellant Joseph Hopkins gave a contract-based personal guaranty that Delancey Abstract Corporation would perform its Agency Agreement with Conestoga and would indemnify Conestoga for attorneys' fees if Delancey was negligent in issuing title insurance on Conestoga's behalf. Conestoga did not file its complaint against Hopkins alleging breach of the guaranty until five years after it learned of its contractual claim against Hopkins[.] Did the Trial Court err in concluding that Conestoga's claims against Hopkins were not barred by the statute of limitations?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-43">C. Did the Trial Court err in refusing to reduce the attorneys' fees chargeable to Hopkins and Delancey as unreasonable for any or all of the following reasons:</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-44">a. Conestoga litigated for eight years without ever ascertaining the amount of money in dispute;</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-45">b. Conestoga denied liability and the existence of a contractual relationship between Plaintiff John Kessock and Conestoga for eight years of litigation, only to admit contractual liability at trial;</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-46">c. The time entries of the attorneys admitted into evidence were recorded recollections requiring the testimony of the declarant at trial, but two of the three attorneys did not testify at trial;</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-47">d. Delancey did not agree to indemnify Conestoga for attorneys' fees related to enforcing the Agency Agreement, yet the judgment requires Hopkins and Delancey to indemnify Conestoga for those charges; and</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-48">e. Attorney Mark Clemm charged $175 per hour for his daughter's time before she was admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania, which is the same rate charged after her admission to practice?</blockquote>
    <p id="p-49">Appellants' Brief at 3-4.</p>
    <p id="p-50">Appellants first complain that the trial court abused its discretion by granting Conestoga's untimely motions to join Appellants as additional defendants. Appellants' Brief at 14. We have explained the joinder procedure as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-51">The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a writ for joinder shall be filed by the original defendant or an additional defendant no later than sixty (60) days after effecting service upon the original defendant of the initial pleading of the plaintiff or any amendment thereof "unless such filing is allowed by the court upon cause shown." Pa.R.C.P. 2253, <strong>Time for Filing Praecipe or Complaint</strong> . Whether there is sufficient cause to allow late joinder of an additional defendant is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-55">According to Appellants, Conestoga filed its first joinder motion sixteen months after the ninety-day joinder period had closed; it offered no credible justification for the delay in filing the motion; and it misrepresented when Conestoga knew of Appellants' liability under the Agency Agreement and Guaranty. Appellants' Brief at 19. Furthermore, Appellants contend that Conestoga filed its second joinder motion three and one-half years after the joinder period had closed; it offered no credible justification for the delay in filing the motion; and it again misrepresented when Conestoga knew of Appellants' liability. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 20-21.</p>
    <p id="p-56">In response, Conestoga argues that only the plaintiff in the underlying action, John Kessock, Jr. ("Kessock"), could object to a late joinder on the ground that Conestoga failed to provide a reasonable excuse for its delay. Conestoga's Brief at 10 (citing Pa.R.C.P. 2253(b) ). According to Conestoga, although Kessock objected to the first and second proposed joinder complaints due to the lack of reasonable delay, he did not file a post-trial motion or appeal the joinder of Appellants. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 13-17. As for Appellants, Conestoga recognizes that they could object to joinder on grounds of prejudice. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 10. Conestoga points out, however, that although Appellants objected to the first joinder motion, they did not object to the second joinder motion; moreover, Appellants "have neither pled nor proven any aspect of legal prejudice, such as the loss of witnesses, the loss of documents, etc." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 17. Conestoga explains it could have filed a separate action against Appellants and moved for consolidation of the cases, but that "would have been a waste of judicial time and effort, as the same result would have been accomplished by simply joining [Appellants]." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> Conestoga concludes that the trial court properly allowed joinder for "purposes of judicial economy." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 18.</p>
    <p id="p-57"><a id="p1053" href="#p1053" data-label="1053" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1053</a>The trial court entered the following findings of fact relevant to Conestoga's joinder motions:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-58">19. Conestoga's first attorney, David Henry, filed a motion to join Delancey, Hopkins, and Hopkins &amp; Schafkopf as additional defendants on May 19, 2011.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-59">20. That motion was granted on June 5, 2012, entered of record on June 6, 2012.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-60">* * *</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-61">24. On November 15, 2012, the [c]ourt ... provided that Conestoga shall have 30 days from the date of notice of that Order to file a Third Party Complaint to join Additional Defendants. The [c]ourt also noted in its Order that the Order shall be served upon Conestoga's attorney of record, David Henry, Esquire, at his address currently reflected on the docket, 444 N. 4th Street, Suite 101, Philadelphia, PA 19122, and at the address reflected in the Certificate of Service of the second Motion for Reconsideration, 20 N. 3rd Street Suite 301-B, Philadelphia, PA 19106.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-62">25. This docket reflects that attempted service of the [c]ourt's November 15, 2012 Order upon Conestoga's prior attorney, David Henry, Esquire, at the two above addresses were returned as undeliverable and provided no forwarding information.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-63">26. Concomitantly with the [c]ourt's unsuccessful attempts at serving notice of the [c]ourt's Orders upon defendant Conestoga's prior attorney, David Henry, Esquire, he became unreachable to Conestoga and ceased communication with Conestoga.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-64">27. Conestoga retained Attorney Mark Clemm, Esquire ("Mr. Clemm") and his firm sometime in late 2012 or early 2013. Mr. Clemm's first entry in this case was March 25, 2013.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-65">28. Conestoga was unaware of the [c]ourt's November 15, 2012 Order granting Conestoga 30 days from the date of notice of that Order to file a Third Party Complaint to join Additional Defendants, until approximately April 2013 after Conestoga retained Mr. Clemm who had reviewed the docket and discovered the [c]ourt's November 15, 2012 Order.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-66">29. On August 2, 2013, Conestoga filed a motion to join Additional Defendants Delancey, Hopkins ... "nunc pro tunc."</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-67">30. Based on the foregoing, on December 11, 203, this [c]ourt granted Conestoga's Motion for Leave to Join Additional Defendants <em>nunc pro tunc</em> .</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-68">31. On December 17, 2013, Conestoga filed its Joinder Complaint.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-69">32. Neither Delancey nor Hopkins filed Preliminary Objections to their joinder.</blockquote>
    <p id="p-70">Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at 3-5. As evidenced by its order allowing joinder, the trial court accepted Conestoga's justification for the untimely motions, although the trial court did not provide any conclusions of law. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at 11-17.</p>
    <p id="p-71">Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 2252(a)(4), joinder is permissible if the additional defendant may be liable to the joining party on any cause of action arising out of the transaction upon which the plaintiff's cause of action is based. Here, Kessock's cause of action against Conestoga arose out of the <a id="p1054" href="#p1054" data-label="1054" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1054</a>omission of an easement from the title search. Conestoga sought joinder of Appellants based on Appellants' liability for the overlooked easement pursuant to the Agency Agreement and the Guaranty. Joinder Complaint, 12/17/13, at ¶¶ 14-20; Counts I, II, and III. We conclude, therefore, that Conestoga's joinder request was appropriate.</p>
    <p id="p-72">Conestoga justifies its delay in filing the joinder motions as the result of not knowing that Kessock "had a direct claim against [Appellants] until Conestoga discovered the relationship between Hopkins and Kessock and that Hopkins provided legal advice as well as title services (through Delancey) to [Kessock]." Conestoga's Brief at 12. Conestoga also cites its inability to contact counsel, Attorney David Henry, as a cause of the delay in filing the joinder complaint. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 13. In contrast, Appellants assert that Conestoga did not have a reasonable excuse for the delayed joinder because it knew at the beginning of the underlying litigation-if not before-that Appellants faced potential liability under the Agency Agreement and the Guaranty. Appellants' Brief at 19. In support of their position, Appellants direct us to several instances in the record demonstrating Conestoga's knowledge of Appellants' potential liability. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 21-23.</p>
    <p id="p-73">Upon review, we find support in the record for the trial court's credibility determination that Attorney Henry's unreachability provided an excuse for Conestoga's untimely filing of the <strong>second</strong> joinder motion in August of 2013. Attorney Henry became unreachable after the November 15, 2012 order directing Conestoga to file a joinder complaint. N.T., 5/1/17, at 76, 93-94. Consequently, the court-approved joinder complaint was not filed until new counsel, Attorney Mark Clemm, renewed the joinder motion in August of 2013.</p>
    <p id="p-74">Conversely, we do not find support in the record for the trial court's credibility determination that Conestoga provided a reasonable excuse for its delay in filing the <strong>first</strong> joinder motion in May of 2011. Rather, the record supports Appellants' claim that Conestoga knew of Appellants' potential liability under the Agency Agreement and the Guaranty prior to receiving complete discovery responses from Kessock. Indeed, the trial court found-and our review of the record confirms-that Conestoga and Delancey executed the Agency Agreement on April 21, 2004; therein, Delancey obligated itself to reimburse Conestoga for damages, attorney's fees, and costs arising out of Delancey's negligence. On the same date, Conestoga and Hopkins executed the Guaranty, in which Hopkins personally guaranteed Delancey's performance of the Agency Agreement. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶¶ 11-15, 77. When Kessock filed his lawsuit on December 16, 2008, therefore, Conestoga knew that Appellants could be liable to Conestoga for attorney's fees and damages depending upon the outcome of Kessock's litigation. Thus, we conclude that Conestoga filed its first joinder motion out of time and lacked a reasonable excuse for the delay.</p>
    <p id="p-75">Nevertheless, we discern no prejudice resulting from the trial court's grant of Conestoga's late joinder motions. The record reveals that, although Kessock objected to Conestoga's untimely joinder motions, it did not challenge the joinder in post-trial motions or an appeal. As for Appellants, they have not argued in this Court, let alone demonstrated, how Conestoga's untimely motions caused them prejudice.</p>

Any action for indemnification before such payment ... is premature."). Procedurally, when Conestoga moved to join Appellants in May of 2011 and August of 2013, it had not paid any damages to Kessock; therefore, the statute of limitations on its potential claims against Appellants for indemnity on damages paid to a third party had not started to run, let alone expire. <strong><em>F.J.

According to Appellants:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-78">Hopkins' duty to guaranty Delancey's performance of the Agency Agreement does not arise under common law.

    <blockquote id="p-80">Logically, for Conestoga to assert a right to indemnity from Hopkins under the Guaranty, Conestoga must assert a claim against Delancey for breach of the Agency Agreement-that is all that Mr. Hopkins guaranteed. Thus, as a matter of law, Conestoga was required to file its complaint against Mr. Hopkins personally for breach of the Guaranty by December 16, 2012-four years after Kessock served his complaint on Conestoga and Conestoga admits to knowing the identity of Delancey as the agent in that transaction.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-82">Conestoga does not challenge the application of a four-year statute of limitations; it challenges when the statute began to run. Specifically, Conestoga argues that its claim against Appellants ripened-and the statute began to run-on November 10, 2016, when the trial court determined in <a id="p1056" href="#p1056" data-label="1056" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1056</a>Conestoga's cross-claim action that "Delancey was negligent in the issuance of title insurance."

    <p id="p-99">The case at hand involves the second type of indemnification, <em>i.e.</em> , Conestoga sought reimbursement from Delancey based only on Delancey's obligations to Conestoga under the Agency Agreement. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶ 90. In Conestoga's words, "The applicable Agency Agreement constituted a binding contract between Conestoga and Delancey Abstract." Joinder Complaint, 12/17/13, at ¶ 35. This case also involves two components of indemnification arising out of Delancey's negligence: damages payable to a third party and attorney's fees and court costs. Agency Agreement, 4/21/04, at ¶ 5.</p>
    <p id="p-100">Opining that "a claim for indemnification arises only after verdict damages have been established," the trial court concluded that the statute of limitations against Delancey began to run "no earlier than November 10, 2016," when the trial court found "Delancey was negligent in the issuance of title insurance." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at ¶¶ 91-92. However, as stated above, "before indemnification rights accrue, the party seeking indemnification must pay the claim or verdict damages before obtaining any rights to pursue an indemnification recovery." <strong><em>Beary</em></strong> , <a href="/pa-super/390/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="390 Pa.

Although the trial court found Conestoga liable to Kessock for breach of contract, it also found that Kessock "failed to present sufficient competent and credible evidence ... that he suffered any damages pursuant to that breach." Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶ 77, 78. Therefore, Conestoga's indemnification rights against Delancey for damages payable to a third party did not accrue because Conestoga did not pay any damages to Kessock.</p>
    <p id="p-101">As for Conestoga's claim against Delancey for attorney's fees and court costs, it accrued according to the fee-shifting language of the Agency Agreement. The relevant language of the Agency Agreement provides that Delancey would be solely liable to Conestoga for all attorney's fees and court costs <strong>resulting from</strong> the negligence of Delancey's agents, officers, or employees in the issuance of title insurance. Agency Agreement, 4/21/04, at ¶ 5. Necessarily, in order for Delancey to be liable for attorney's fees and costs <strong>resulting</strong> from its negligence, there must be a finding that Delancey was negligent. In this case, that finding occurred when the trial court ruled in favor of Conestoga on its cross-claim against Appellants. N.T., 11/10/16, at 76. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that Conestoga's cause of action against Delancey arose on November 10, 2016, with the finding of Delancey's <a id="p1059" href="#p1059" data-label="1059" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1059</a>negligence in issuing the title insurance. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶¶ 77, 91-92.

    <p id="p-102">Hopkins signed the Guaranty, not under seal, on April 21, 2004. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶¶ 14, 15. The statute of limitations for a contract not under seal is four years. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5525. Accordingly, Conestoga had to file suit against Hopkins pursuant to the Guaranty within four years of the finding of Delancey's negligence, <em>i.e.</em> , on or before November 10, 2020. Conestoga filed its joinder complaint on December 17, 2013, well before the statute of limitations began to run, let alone expire. Thus, we discern no error in the trial court's conclusion that "Conestoga's claims against Hopkins were brought well within the four-year statute of limitations." Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶ 93.</p>
    <p id="p-103">Appellants' third and final issue challenges the trial court's refusal to reduce the award of $68,887.45 as reasonable attorney's fees and costs to Conestoga on its cross-claim against Appellants. Appellants' Brief at 30; Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶¶ 94-103. Appellants argue that the amount awarded was unreasonable because: (1) Conestoga litigated the dispute for eight years without ascertaining the amount of money in dispute; (2) Conestoga litigated the dispute for eight years only to admit contractual liability at trial; (3) the trial court failed to exclude inadmissible hearsay about attorney charges for individuals who did not testify; (4) the trial court failed to exclude charges related to enforcing the Agency Agreement; and (5) the trial court failed to exclude amounts billed as attorney's fees for work done by a paralegal. Appellants' Brief at 31-39.</p>

    <blockquote id="p-108">48. At the assessment of damages phase of the trial, Conestoga presented the testimony of William Parker, Esquire ("Mr. Parker"), in-house counsel for Conestoga.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-109">49. The testimony of Mr. Parker was credible and accepted by the [c]ourt.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-110">50. Mr. Parker commenced employment with Conestoga in 2009, shortly after this civil action was commenced.

Mr. Clemm and the law firms with which he was associated continuously represented Conestoga in this case from March, 2013 to the present.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-113">53. For this claim, Mr. Parker and other principals of Conestoga reviewed, approved of, and paid the bills for legal fees and costs submitted by Mr. Clemm and his associates.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-135">Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at 7-11.</p>
    <p id="p-136">Based on its findings of fact, the trial court entered the following conclusions of law:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-137">101. The hourly rates charged by Mr. Clemm and his associates were consistent with rates charged by other lawyers in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania who provide similar types of legal services in similar types of cases.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-138">102. The legal fees and costs billed by Mr. Clemm and his associates were necessary in order to defend Conestoga against the claims made by Kessock and in order to plead and prove the claims made by Conestoga against Delancey for recovery of attorney's fees and costs incurred by Conestoga.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-139">103. The amount of $69,519.95 billed by Mr. Clemm and his associates is reasonable less the $632.50 Mr. Clemm billed above his negotiated rate of $300 per hour.<sup>3,</sup><sup>4</sup> Delancey is obligated to pay Conestoga the sum of $68,887.45 to reimburse Conestoga for the reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by Conestoga in this case.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-140"><sup>3</sup> After nitpicking Mr. Clemm's bills in ways not supported by common sense or case law, Delancey asserted that Conestoga should only recover $4,067.25 in attorney's fees. That is, [Appellants] argued that the reasonable rate for a law firm to represent a client for over four years and successfully through trial was only slightly more than $1,000 per year of representation. The [c]ourt need say no more regarding the absurdity of this assertion.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-141"><a id="p1063" href="#p1063" data-label="1063" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1063</a><sup>4</sup> Delancey asserts that the test laid out in <em>Neal v. Bavarian Motors, Inc.</em> , <a href="/a2d/882/1022-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="882 A.2d 1022" data-case-ids="8921651" data-case-paths="/a2d/882/1022-01">882 A.2d 1022</a>, 1032 (Pa. Super. 2005) is applicable to this case. <em>Neal</em> lays out the facts which should be considered when assessing the reasonableness of counsel fees "in a case involving a lawsuit which includes claims under the UTPCPL (the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law)." The factors are: "(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill requisite properly to conduct the case; (2) The customary charges of the members of the bar for similar services; (3) The amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the clients from the services; and (4) The contingency or certainty of the compensation." The present matter obviously does not fall under the UTPCPL. Moreover, the party who could recover attorney's fees under the UTPCPL would by necessity always be the Plaintiff. Therefore, the fourth factor clearly makes no sense in the context of a defendant requesting attorney's fees under a contractual provision. The third factor is arguably irrelevant as well since the defendant has no control over having been sued. The defendant cannot simply drop a case, even if it deems the amount in controversy to be low. Certainly the defendant could attempt to settle the case with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff could always refuse. Therefore, in the case of an intractable plaintiff, a defendant would be forced to continue to incur attorney's fees no matter what it deemed the amount in controversy to be. Here, [Kessock] asserted that [his] claim was worth more than $1,000,000. Therefore, there is no evidence that [Kessock], who ultimately did proceed with this case through trial, would have agreed to settle the case for a nominal amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent this test is applicable to the case at bar, the [c]ourt determines that the fees requested by Conestoga are reasonable under the elements of the <em>Neal</em> test.</blockquote>
    <p id="p-142">Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at 16-17.</p>
    <p id="p-143">On appeal, Appellants complain that Conestoga litigated the dispute for eight years without ascertaining the amount of money in dispute, only to admit contractual liability at trial. Appellants' Brief at 31-33. However, the trial court assessed attorney's fees as of Attorney Clemm's involvement in the case, which began in March of 2013, four years after Kessock filed his lawsuit against Conestoga. N.T., 5/1/17, at 140. During his representation, Attorney Clemm defended Conestoga against Kessock's claim <strong>and</strong> pursued Conestoga's cross-claims against Appellants; both lawsuits arose out of the incomplete title search. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 113-114. Thus, we discern no merit to Appellants' first two bases for challenging the trial court's award of attorney's fees to Conestoga.</p>
    <p id="p-144">Appellants next assail the trial court's failure to exclude inadmissible hearsay about attorney charges for individuals who did not testify, <em>i.e.</em> , Joshua Knepp ("Attorney Knepp") and Katie Clemm. Appellants' Brief at 35. Specifically, Appellants contend that the "compilation of individual time entries spanning the four years that the Clemm Firm handled this case ... are hearsay within hearsay," proven for the truth of the matter asserted. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> (citing Pa.R.E. 801 ). Relying on the "recorded recollections" hearsay exception,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> <a id="p1064" href="#p1064" data-label="1064" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1064</a>Appellants argue that, because Attorney Knepp and Katie Clemm did not testify at trial, Conestoga failed to prove all charges related to their time entries. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 35-36 (citing Pa.R.E. 8803.1(3) ). Therefore, Appellants conclude, the award of attorney's fees should be reduced by the amount of Attorney Knepp's and Katie Clemm's billings. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 36.</p>
    <p id="p-145">In response, Conestoga argues for admissibility of the invoices under an exception to the hearsay rule known as "Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity." Conestoga's Brief at 26 (citing Pa.R.E. 803(6) ).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> According to Conestoga, Attorney Clemm was "an authenticating witness" who provided "sufficient information relating to the preparation and maintenance of the records to justify a presumption of trustworthiness for the business records of a company." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> (citing <strong><em>U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Pautenis</em></strong> , <a href="/a3d/118/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="118 A.3d 386" data-case-ids="6860574" data-case-paths="/a3d/118/0386-01">118 A.3d 386</a>, 401 (Pa. Super. 2015) ).</p>
    <p id="p-146">Upon review of the record, we observe that, at trial, Appellants objected to the admission of any evidence related to Attorney Knepp's time; however, they did not object to evidence related to Katie Clemm's time. N.T., 5/1/17, at 40-42. Therefore, Appellants' challenge to the admissibility of evidence of Katie Clemm's time is waived. <strong><em>See</em></strong> <strong><em>Folger v. Dugan</em></strong> , <a href="/a2d/876/1049-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="876 A.2d 1049" data-case-ids="8968882" data-case-paths="/a2d/876/1049-01">876 A.2d 1049</a> (Pa. Super. 2005) (challenge to admissibility based upon improper authentication is waived where party failed to object on that basis at trial).</p>
    <p id="p-147">As to the evidence of Attorney Knepp's time, we conclude that Attorney Clemm proved the criteria for admission of his firm's invoices under Pa.R.E. 803(6). The record confirms that Attorney Clemm was president of the law firms that represented Conestoga. N.T., 5/1/17, at 116. His associate, Attorney Knepp, used the Time Slips program for recording time "every six minutes of every hour of every day that they worked on a case." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 115, 131. Attorney Clemm supervised Attorney Knepp's work on this case, and he reviewed Attorney Knepp's time records on a monthly basis. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 116, 134-135, 142-143. The records were then submitted to the bookkeeper who generated the worksheets. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 115, 137. Once Attorney Knepp reviewed the worksheets for accuracy, <a id="p1065" href="#p1065" data-label="1065" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1065</a>the bookkeeper generated invoices and sent them to the client. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 116, 135, 137-138. Nothing in the record indicates a lack of trustworthiness in the source of information or other circumstances. Pa.R.E. 803(6)(E). Moreover, the trial court made a credibility determination as to Attorney Clemm's testimony, and we detect no reason to disturb it. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶ 61. Based on the foregoing, we discern no merit to Appellants' claims that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting all of the attorney invoices in support of Conestoga's claim for attorney's fees.</p>
    <p id="p-148">Appellants further assail the trial court's failure to exclude charges related to enforcing the Agency Agreement. Appellants' Brief at 37. We dispose of this issue by adopting as our own the well-reasoned analysis of the trial court:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-149"><sup>2</sup> Delancey argues that attorney's fees attributable to enforcement of the Agency Agreement itself should be interpreted as excluded from [paragraph 5]. The [c]ourt, however, is not persuaded. First, the plain language of the contract does not so limit the recovery of attorney's fees. Fees related to enforcement of the Agency Agreement by definition "result from" Delancey and its agents' negligence. But for Delancey's agents' negligence, Conestoga would not have incurred legal fees enforcing its agreement with Delancey.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-150">Delancey cites only two cases to buttress their argument, <em>Twnshp. of Millcreek v. Angela Cres Trust of June 25</em> , <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.3d%2098" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="142 A.3d 98">142 A.3d 98</a> [948], 956 (Pa. Commwlth. 2016) ; <em>Neal v. Bavarian Motors, Inc.</em> , <a href="/a2d/882/1022-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="882 A.2d 1022" data-case-ids="8921651" data-case-paths="/a2d/882/1022-01">882 A.2d 1022</a>, 1032 (Pa. Super. 2005). However, both cases are readily distinguishable from the present matter. These cases relate to statutory attorney's fees as opposed to attorney's fees provided for in a contract. This is important, because in both cases, the court held that the attorney's fees sought were not actually provided for in each statute. In <em>Twnshp. of Millcreek</em> , attorney's fees were not awarded because the bills submitted for reimbursement were pursuant to a proceeding for which reimbursement of attorney's fees was not provided for by statute. <em>Twnshp. of Millcreek v. Angela Cres Trust of June 25</em> , <a href="/a3d/142-2/0948-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="142 A.3d 948" data-case-ids="12486285,6787922" data-case-paths="/a3d/142-2/0948-01,/a3d/142/0948-01">142 A.3d 948</a>, 956 (Pa. Commwlth. 2016). Similarly, in <em>Neal</em> , attorney's fees were not awarded because they were sought under a cause of action for which reimbursement of attorney's fees was not provided for by statute. <em>Neal v. Bavarian Motors, lnc.</em> , <a href="/a2d/882/1022-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="882 A.2d 1022" data-case-ids="8921651" data-case-paths="/a2d/882/1022-01">882 A.2d 1022</a>, 1032 (Pa.

    <p id="p-151">Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at 16 n.2.</p>
    <p id="p-152">Finally, Appellants complain that the trial court failed to exclude amounts billed as attorney's fees for work done by a paralegal. Appellants' Brief at 39. Appellants contend as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-153">Conestoga expended $3,412.50 for the activities of Katie McKenzie Clemm between March 26, 2015 and October 13, 2015.

    <blockquote id="p-154">However, Ms. Clemm was not admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania until October 19, 2015. After Ms. Clemm's admission to the bar of Pennsylvania, her time was charged at the same hourly rate of $175.00.</blockquote>

    <p id="p-156">Appellants' Brief at 39 (citations to reproduced record omitted).</p>
    <p id="p-157">Conestoga counters that Ms. Clemm's paralegal rate of $175 per hour "reflect[ed] a reasonable rate charged by a senior, highly experienced paralegal. After Ms. Clemm was admitted to practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, her rate remained at the same rate of $175 per hour which reflected a reasonable rate charged by a young associate with her level of experience." Conestoga's Brief at 31 (citing N.T., 5/1/17, at 117).</p>
    <p id="p-158">The crux of Appellants' argument is that Ms. Clemm's status was misrepresented under the heading of "Lawyer" while she was still a paralegal. N.T., 5/1/17, at Exhibit D-9. In light of the record before us, we consider this argument disingenuous. At the trial on damages, William Parker, Conestoga's Vice President of Claims and Underwriting, testified that his negotiations with Attorney Clemm's firm for representation "took into account whether it's a billing for a paralegal, whether it's a billing for an attorney."<strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 72-73. He further testified that part of Conestoga's original memorandum of understanding with Clemm and Associates "was that [Ms. Clemm] would be working on the case as well at the hourly rate of [$]175." <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 73. Conestoga considered the bills received from Attorney Clemm's firm to be fair and reasonable. <strong><em>Id.</em></strong> at 74.</p>
    <p id="p-159">Additionally, Attorney Clemm described Ms. Clemm's status as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="p-160">And also [Ms. Clemm] working at the firm as well. I think [she] started working on the file in March of 2015. And in my estimation, it was appropriate to bill [her] out at $175 an hour at that time. Because as a third year law student you were far more experienced than any paralegal would have been under similar circumstances. So the $175 an hour was a rate which reflected that.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="p-161">And after [she] passed the bar, I think in October of 2015, then I elected not to increase [her] rate because [she was] being at that point slightly underpaid as a first year associate in terms of the hourly rate being charged. But I thought it was appropriate to continue that particular rate, based upon [her] age, experience, et cetera. And that was something which was approved by the company, it was understood by the company and agreed to by the company.</blockquote>
    <p id="p-162">N.T., 5/1/17, at 117-118. As observed above, the trial court considered Attorney Clemm's testimony to be credible, and we detect no basis on which to overrule its determination. Decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 8/17/17, at ¶ 61. Therefore, we discern no merit to Appellants' final basis for challenging the award of attorney's fees.</p>
    <p id="p-163">In sum, Appellants have failed to persuade us that the trial court erred in finding in favor of Conestoga on its cross-claim for attorney's fees pursuant to the Agency Agreement and the Guaranty. Therefore, we affirm the entry of judgment against Appellants.</p>
    <p id="p-164">Judgment affirmed.</p>
