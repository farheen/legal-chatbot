Gierie III (Robbie), appeal from a judgment entered in Superior Court (Cumberland County, <em>Cole, J.) </em>denying their M.R. Civ. P. 50(b) post-jury verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on their medical malpractice complaint against Mercy Hospital. The Gieries contend that the trial court violated their right to a jury trial by admitting a redacted version of the medical malpractice panel’s findings, and by denying them the right to fully and effectively cross-examine the Hospital’s expert witness as to his credibility and possible bias. The Gieries also argue that the trial court abused its discretion and misapplied the law by admitting in evidence the discovery deposition of an expert designated by another party. We affirm the judgment.</p>

Lynn was admitted to Mercy Hospital at 2:00 a.m. on March 30, 1999. There were no medical records indicating any prenatal medical complications for either Lynn or her unborn child prior to her admission. The Hospital’s records reveal that when Robbie <a id="p946" href="#p946" data-label="946" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*946</a>was born, he was gagging and had to be resuscitated. His oxygen saturation level was forty percent at 2:24 a.m., and he did not show any sign of independent respira-tions until 3:45 p.m. Robbie’s early diagnosis was hypoxic ischemic injury — lack of oxygen to the brain and other organs— with resulting hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy consistent with early signs of cerebral palsy.</p>

Freedman and Murray-Pulsifer; agency liability for In-termed Family Practice based on its relationship with Drs. Freedman and Murray-Pulsifer; intentional infliction of emotional distress; negligent infliction of emotional distress; liability for negligent infliction of emotional distress as to Lynn and Robert as bystanders; and reciprocal loss of consortium.</p>

For purposes of expert witness designation, parties with common interests shall be considered one party.” In August of 2006, Dr. Murray-Pulsifer and Intermed designated John Fi-ascone, M.D. as an expert. Although the Hospital never designated Dr. Fiascone as an expert witness, its expert witness designation did state that the Hospital “adopt[ed] and reserve[d] the right to call any other parties’ experts.” On April 4, 2006, the Gieries’ counsel conducted a video deposition of Dr. Fiascone.</p>

During trial, the Hospital presented expert testimony that the cause of Robbie’s cerebral palsy was undetectable sepsis/chorioamnionitis complicated by funis-titis, inflammation and infection, which began prior to labor. Specifically, John Salvato, M.D., a pediatrician, and Dr. Fi-ascone, a neonatalogist, both testified that the resuscitation efforts at Robbie’s birth did not breach the standard of care and that hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy was not the cause of Robbie’s cerebral palsy.</p>

Dr. Lerner also was asked and testified about his service on a Legislative Committee of the Massachusetts Medical Society, his involvement with legislation regarding liability issues, and his work testifying as an expert in medical malpractice cases. The trial court excluded evidence that the organization for which Dr. Lerner served on the board was Pro-mutual, a mutual insurance company that insures doctors and other medical providers for medical liability; Promutual did not insure the Hospital at the time of Robbie’s birth, and was not at risk in this case, but it did subsequently become the Hospital’s insurer, and was the Hospital’s insurer at the time of trial.</p>

The Court has explained this to you. Mr. Lilley in the close to two hours of his argument in chief didn’t mention this at all. Not surprising. If the panel had voted for his clients, do you think he would have mentioned that in his closing statement? For you to determine. That is substantive evidence, as the Court explained, that this panel determined unanimously that the nurses who have been criticized for lackadaisical actions, for not caring, for leaving this child alone, for leaving the mother alone, subjecting them apparently to harm as counsel suggested, this three-member panel said no. The chair, the lawyer, the nurse, no, no, no.

The Gier-ies, however, urge us to construe the “absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition” language in Rule 32 to include a failure to take affirmative steps to secure an expert witness’s appearance at trial. <em>See Caron v.
