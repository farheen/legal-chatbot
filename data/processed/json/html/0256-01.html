He told the officer that an individual known as “Ricky” was on Georgia Avenue between Kenyon Street and Princeton Place, N. W., with “dope” on him. The informant described “Ricky” as being a Negro male of medium complexion, approximately 20 years old, skinny, about 5’6” tall, wearing a black knit cap with a tassel, a black fake fur coat with a brown collar, and blue trousers.

The government correctly points out that the <em>Draper </em>decision requires that we carefully examine the tip to determine if “[a] magistrate, when confronted with such detail, could reasonably infer that the informant had gained his information in a reliable way.” <em>Spinelli, supra </em>at 417 of <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">393 U.S., at </a>589 of 89 S.Ct.</p>

As in <em>Draper, </em>before arrest the officers were able to corroborate the informant’s tip in every detail with the exception of actual possession of narcotics. Comparing these facts with <em>Draper, </em>there is substantial similarity. In <em>Draper </em>the informer gave a description of the suspect which was only slightly more detailed than the instant one. The informer’s information concerning Draper’s location was that he was <em>presently </em>in Chicago (September 6, 1956), and that he would return by train on the morning of September 7 or 8.</p>

    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[197,1638,751,770]]]'>During the motion to suppress, it developed that Officer Shuler had recorded the description of appellant on a 3x5 note card. When the defense moved for its production under the Jencks Act (18 U.S. C. § 3500 (1969)), the officer said that he did not keep these cards.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He explained that he simply did not bother to preserve them once the information was transferred to a Police Department Form 163.

That decision dealt with the failure to produce a <em>tape recording </em>of defendant’s conversation. Therefore, assuming, without deciding, that <em>Bryant </em>may be controlling here because of its directive to establish procedures for preserving investigative notes, we find that the failure of Officer Shuler to preserve the 3x5 note card was harmless error. First, there is no doubt about appellant’s guilt — he was found with narcotics on his person within minutes after the incident was reported. Second, the informant’s tip was orally relayed to Officer Dean, who was present at the time Shuler received the telephone call. Third, and perhaps most important, Officer Dean was the first to spot appellant on Georgia Avenue from the description which had been given by Shuler. Fourth, Officer Dean did not rely on the questioned notes. Fifth, there was no bad faith suppression or destruction of the 3x5 card. Finally, the trial judge found that the description written on the 3x5 card was accurately recorded on the P.D. 163. This finding is supported by Officer Dean’s testimony as to what Officer Shuler told him at the time he received the tip and by the fact that Dean, not Shuler, spotted appellant in the carryout shop.
