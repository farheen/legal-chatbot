In this opinion we clarify the certification provisions of former NRS 62.080, as amended in 1995, and remand to the juvenile division with instructions to reconsider the matter in light of our interpretation of NRS 62.080(2) (b).</p>

Under the 1995 amendment, it is declared that the public safety and welfare require certification to adult court in juvenile cases involving the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon; and in such cases the juvenile court “shall certify” the child for criminal proceedings <em>unless </em>the court finds that the child was “not a principal actor” or that certain “exceptional circumstances exist.” Under the statutory amendment, underaged persons charged with offenses involving the use of a deadly weapon are presumed <em>not </em>to come within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</p>

H. has been sufficiently “charged” with an offense involving a deadly weapon so as to give rise to the presumption of certification, we base reversal of the juvenile court’s denial of certification on its quite understandable misapplication of the “exceptional circumstances” language in the statute. The pertinent language of NRS 62.080(2) at the time of J. H.’s certification was as follows:</p>

It involves some showing by the State that the juvenile committed the charged act. As pointed out in Breed v.

    <p id="b591-7" data-blocks='[["BL_591.9",591,[220,1072,1124,633]]]'>Once the State has pleaded its certification charges and has established “prosecutive merit” by showing that there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed an offense involving the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon or an attempt to commit such an offense, a presumption is created under which the juvenile court “shall certify the child for proper criminal proceedings.” At this point the burden of going forward shifts to the respondent child who must then present evidence either that he or she was not a “principal actor in the offense” or that mitigating, “exceptional circumstances,” of the kind set out in the statute, exist. Because it is clear that J. H. was the only actor and therefore the principal actor in this offense, we will deal only with the questions relating to the “exceptional circumstances” portion of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b591-8" data-blocks='[["BL_591.10",591,[219,1712,1123,357]],["BL_592.1",592,[222,278,1121,583]]]'>Before discussing the mitigating “exceptional circumstances” which, according to the statute, must be the cause of the “child’s actions,” we first address whether the presumption created by the statute went into effect at all in this case. Absent “prosecutive merit” to the charges, there can be no presumption. The limited facts that can be gathered from this record reveal that the State’s establishment of prosecutive merit is problematical. J. H. is charged with assault with a deadly weapon and with burglary. <a id="p1412" href="#p1412" data-label="1412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1412</a>The assault with a deadly weapon charge stems from a charged “unlawful attempt... to commit a violent injury” upon another boy. The burglary charge is that J. H. entered the boy’s home through an unlocked door “with the intent to commit assault or battery.” The original juvenile court petition alleges that J. H. “slash[ed] at the victim with a knife.” The “slashing” charge appears from the record to be limited to J. H.’s angry brandishing of a knife during a quarrel with the mentioned boy concerning the boy’s treatment of J. H.’s sister. Although the formal charge against J. H. is that he “attempt[ed] ... to commit violent injury,” the facts relating to the charged attempt to commit violent injury and to the specific intent necessary for a burglary charge were never aired in these certification proceedings.</p>

H.’s counsel did not include this affidavit in the record on appeal, we have no idea as to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence supporting prosecutive merit. Rather than oppose the State’s evidence and pursue J. H.’s version of the case, namely, that he did not threaten the boy with a knife during their quarrel <em>{see </em>note 2, <em>infra), </em>J. H.’s counsel stated to the juvenile court that counsel was “not going into the facts” of the case. J. H.’s counsel made no attempt to counter the State’s case with regard to prosecutive merit and indicated to the court that “if we had submitted affidavits,” they would have “indicated] that the victim [was] a crack head and that it didn’t happen this way and there was no knife and that I know that that’s not going to be the issue.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p1413" href="#p1413" data-label="1413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1413</a>From the few facts that appear in the record, J. H.’s version appears to be that he had been offended by the way in which the “victim” had treated his sister, that he did not threaten the boy with a knife, and that he did not have any intent to harm the boy, much less to “commit violent injury.” Under Keys v. State, <a href="/nev/104/0736-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="104 Nev. 736" data-case-ids="8558563" data-case-paths="/nev/104/0736-01">104 Nev. 736</a>, <a href="/nev/104/0736-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="104 Nev. 736" data-case-ids="8558563" data-case-paths="/nev/104/0736-01">766 P.2d 270</a> (1988), the State must prove a specific intent in order to establish the crime of attempt. Although prose-cutive merit was not litigated, there was a strong possibility that mental elements of the assault charge as well as the burglary charge would have been very difficult to prove. It is therefore possible that the case might have ended at the prosecutive merit stage of the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.7",593,[215,888,1126,358]]]'>Because we are reviewing the subject statutory amendment for the first time, the prosecutive merit aspect of these certification proceedings has been discussed; however, this question was not raised by J.

H.’s contention that the juvenile court did not properly define or apply the “exceptional circumstances” provision of the statute. The trial judge, quite understandably, read the statutory language narrowly to mean that in order to rebut the presumption of certification, he had to find that J. H.’s criminal “actions were substantially the result” of J. H.’s substance abuse, that is to say, that the charged behavior was <em>caused </em>by substance abuse and not by J. H.’s volitional acts. The trial judge could not and would not find that J. H.’s actions were the “result” of substance abuse. The juvenile court judge certainly cannot be faulted for this reading of the statute. The statute says that the criminal actions must be the <em>result </em>of substance abuse, and the <a id="p1414" href="#p1414" data-label="1414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1414</a>judge simply concluded that criminal actions cannot be the result of drug use. Reading the statute in the way that he did, the judge necessarily took the position that there was no set of facts under which he could find that criminal conduct was the <em>result </em>of substance abuse. Given the juvenile court judge’s frame of mind, it would not appear that J. H. had any chance of rebutting the presumption of certification.</p>

Geno’s involvement in this battery created a presumption of certification under NRS 62.080(2)(b). The other two charges upon which certification is based are of lesser offense and, of themselves, would not support the certification of Geno, a first offender, to the adult court. The issue in the case, then, is whether the juvenile court erred in its application of the deadly weapon presumption in ordering that Geno be certified for adult prosecution based on the battery of Darci, Count II of the juvenile court petition.</p>

A car with seven teenage occupants arrived at the intersection at the same <a id="p1420" href="#p1420" data-label="1420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1420</a>time.

According to Darci’s testimony, Tommy, Nick, and Geno then approached Frank, surrounded him, and began to hit and kick Frank. However, Mark (whom the State chose not to prosecute) testified at the certification hearing that Geno stood by him at the car during the altercation between Frank, Toby, Tommy, and Nick. Darci acknowledged that Mark had not participated in the incident. Sarah, who stayed in the car with Kristen during the entire incident, testified that she saw Mark standing by the car, but did not see Geno.

Shortly thereafter, while still on her hands and knees, Darci alleged that she saw a metal baseball bat swinging at the center of her face. She did not see who wielded the baseball bat, but turned her head to the right, absorbing the blow with her left jaw, which was fractured in two places, necessitating reconstructive surgery the following day.

She maintained that she could not identify who broke her jaw, and she denied ever physically engaging any of Frank’s assailants. Various witnesses were on the scene, but almost all of them refused to give statements, claiming that they were afraid of retribution from Frank and Darci’s assailants. According to police, several witnesses stated that they had seen a baseball bat used during the fight. A metal baseball bat was recovered from the assailants’ car; however, no usable fingerprints were found on the bat. In Richard’s police statement, he asserted that the man <a id="p1421" href="#p1421" data-label="1421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1421</a>who attacked Darci was between 5'8" and 5'9".

It is clear from a transcript of the hearing, however, that Geno was on notice of the charge upon which certification was based in this case and that the crucial issue before the court was whether or not Geno was a “principal actor” in the battery.</p>

No one saw Geno with a bat in his hand; Geno was smaller than the assailant described by witnesses as the wielder of the bat, and there were no fingerprints or other physical evidence that Geno battered Darci with a baseball bat. Although Darci, the victim of the battery, saw Geno standing nearby before she was struck, she could not testify that it was Geno who battered her with the bat.</p>

The juvenile court held that the battery with a deadly weapon charge had prosecutive merit. We conclude that there was enough evidence for the juvenile court to conclude that Geno was charged with an offense “involving the use ... of a deadly weapon” and that, accordingly, it must be presumed, under NRS 62.080(2)(b), that Geno should be certified unless it appears that he was “not a principal actor in the offense.” It was therefore incumbent upon Geno to rebut the presumption by a showing that he was “not a principal actor in the offense.” Put another way, it was established that Geno was an “actor” in the offense, and the only issue before the juvenile court was whether he was a <em>principal </em>actor.</p>

Under the juvenile court’s definition of principal actor, Geno was a principal actor just by being there and “participating” in some way in the total fray.</p>

The statutory definition of a “principal” is in harmony with the trial judge’s definition of “all those who participate in some fashion”; but this, we believe, is a broader definition than that intended by the legislature to be applied in cases in which those who have an insubstantial role in a crime may be excepted from the presumption of certification by reason of their not being “principal actor[s]” in the offense.</p>

With respect to NRS 62.080(2)(b), the 1997 legislature limited mandatory certification to crimes involving the use of a “firearm,” as opposed to the broader category of crimes involving the use of a “deadly weapon.” The legislative history to the 1997 amendment indicates that the 1995 legislature may not have intended to create such a broad category of crimes when enacting the mandatory certification provisions of NRS 62.080(2)(b). Hearing on A.B. 438 Before the Assembly Judiciary Comm., 69th Leg. (Nev., June 13, 1997); Hearing on A.B. 438 Before the Senate Judiciary Comm., 69th Leg. (Nev., June 17, 1997). In contrast, the 1997 legislature removed the “principal actor” exception to mandatory certification, thus expanding certification to all actors in a crime involving the use of a firearm. The trial court, on remand, may consider as persuasive the 1997 amendments when resolving the State’s motions to certify these minors for adult prosecution.</p>
