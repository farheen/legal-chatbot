As far as these trips were concerned, Touhy had contacted Starkweather by telephone to request coverage. In both instances a series of conversations between the parties followed in which the itinerary, the names of crew members, the extent of crew experience, and other necessary underwriting information were discussed. Marcum testified that it was standard practice in the insurance industry to require crew information before issuing an offshore policy. Touhy was also informed by Marcum that Starkweather needed to explore various issues with its underwriter before it could extend a commitment for coverage. After gathering the necessary information from Touhy and conferring with its underwriter, Marcum in both instances had contacted Touhy to indicate that commitments for riders would be issued, although the actual riders and bills for the additional premiums were mailed to Touhy several months after the respective voyages.</p>

    <p id="b272-12" data-blocks='[["BL_272.14",272,[998,959,754,517]]]'>Starkweather argues that the conversation between Touhy and the unidentified female employee did not as a matter of law obligate Starkweather to procure the rider for Ken-ney. Starkweather supports this position by noting that Touhy requested only a return call, not the procurement of coverage.

However, the informality of the parties’ business dealings cannot overcome the crucial fact that Touhy never expressly directed Starkweather to procure coverage for the Bermuda Race. Although Kenney points to Touhy’s answers to interrogatories to suggest otherwise, we note that such an answer was merely a counseled summary that consisted of only a eonclusory statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In his sworn testimony, which <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>provided the only evidence of the words spoken in the conversation with the unidentified woman, Touhy candidly admitted that coverage was not ordered. In fact all Touhy requested was a return phone call from Mar-cum. The request for a return call, when viewed against the whole of Touhy’s conversation with the unidentified woman, merely suggests that Touhy was proposing to open discussions with Marcum, not that he was requesting to have a rider issued by the <em>woman. </em>The unexpressed intention of Touhy cannot control our determination, and the absence of a request for coverage weighs conclusively against the imposition of a duty.</p>
    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[165,965,754,659]]]'>We also consider the fact that Touhy did not disclose any information that had been crucial to the issuance of riders in the past, such as crew information and the itinerary. Although Kenney claims that this is irrelevant and that one simple telephone call informing Starkweather that “they were going to Bermuda” was all that was necessary in the past to receive coverage, the record plainly indicates otherwise. It was the practice of Starkweather, as well as the prevailing custom of the insurance industry, to require crew information befóte tendering a coverage commitment for any offshore policy.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.6",273,[164,1647,754,516]]]'>Furthermore, Touhy did not know the name of or position held in the firm by the woman with whom he spoke. It defies credibility to believe, as Kenney would have us do, that Touhy, who had dealt with Marcum when obtaining a rider in the past, would have placed an order for coverage with an unknown person without ascertaining her identity or inquiring into whether she even possessed sufficient authority to bind Stark-weather in regard to a coverage request.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

On the other hand, imposing upon a person in Touhy’s position the requirement simply to follow up his initial call, provide the necessary underwriting information, and expressly instruct Marcum to obtain coverage poses only a slight burden.</p>

First, Kenney argues that we “need not engage in the extensive duty analysis suggested by defendant” because Marcum admitted on cross-examination that he had a duty to procure coverage.

Rather the prior course of dealings demonstrates the exact opposite—a series of information-gathering discussions which ended with a confirmatory call from Starkweather assuring Ken-ney that it would receive coverage. In light of this past history we conclude that a reasonable person in Touhy’s position would have expected further discussions after the initial contact with Starkweather and would not have construed silence as acceptance.
