Hillock, who was a pedestrian walking in an easterly direction on the public highway designated as Route #22 running in a generally easterly and westerly direction, and near the intersection of Route #22 with Saco Street. The road west of the intersection for a distance of 1500 feet or more is a straight two-lane highway. The posted speed was 35 m.p.h. and the estimated speed of the defendant was 20-25 m.p.h. The night was clear and visibility good. The paved portion of the road was practically clear of snow with some snow on the shoulders of the road. There were no cars traveling either in front or rear of the defendant in his line of traffic. There were cars traveling in the opposite or westerly direction and the headlights of defendant’s car were on low beam.</p>
    <p id="b468-13" data-blocks='[["BL_468.13",468,[983,1197,752,1497]]]'>The plaintiff and his brother Richard, together with their companion Siegfried Myers, were walking somewhere between the southerly side of the paved portion of the road and the snow bank on the southerly side of the shoulder. When they reached a point approximately 200-250 feet west of the intersection the Myers boy crossed over to the northerly side of the road, continuing to walk on the northerly side while the plaintiff and his brother Richard continued walking somewhere between the southerly side of the paved portion and the snow bank on the southerly side of the shoulder, Richard walking approximatley 50-60 feet ahead of his brother John. A moment prior to the accident Richard turned to his brother John and said: “Look”, “Stop — Look”. The defendant did not see the plaintiff, neither did the plaintiff see the defendant’s car nor the light of the car as it approached the plaintiff. A short distance west of the intersection the defendant felt a slight brush against the right side of his automobile, continuing a short distance felt a thud and immediately brought his automobile to a stop. He then got out of his automobile, found Richard lying halfway on the traveled portion of the road and the rest of his body on the shoulder, and close by pieces of the broken lens of the right headlight.</p>

The statute distinctly commands him “when practicable” to walk only on the left side of the highway or its shoulder. A party in such a position has the burden of proving excuse or justification. He has the affirmative of the issue. Failure to excuse or justify walking on the wrong side of the road spells negligence. It is axiomatic that a pedestrian, who does not comply with the statute and its purpose, does not avail himself of every reasonable precaution for his safety and is negligent, but the plaintiff would still have to carry the burden of proving that his violation of the statute was not a proximate contributing cause of the accident. Whether walking on the wrong side of the road when not excusable or justifiable, i. e. when practicable to walk on the left side of the road facing traffic, is a proximate contributing cause of the accident under all the facts and circumstances of the case is usually a jury question.

On the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, however, the Spang rule does not apply. A pedestrian under certain conditions may be effectively camouflaged and virtually invisible a few feet away. The figure of an eleven year old boy at the side of the road in the hours of darkness wearing what in effect may appear as black and white clothing against the black and white background of macadam, gravel and snow, is not to be compared to a trailer loaded with hay under a street light (Spang v.

The <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>evidence, however, admits of still another theory. The defendant insists that his car never left the macadam surface. The plaintiff places himself on the gravel shoulder. It is admitted that just before the accident occurred the plaintiff’s brother shouted “Let’s go.” “Look”. “Stop”— “Look”. A jury could find that at that moment the plaintiff stepped or darted from the shoulder on to the macadam directly in the path of the defendant’s car in such manner and with such celerity that even if the defendant had been observing the plaintiff he could not have acted to avoid the accident. In short, we are here concerned not only with whether or not or when the defendant should have seen the plaintiff, but also what the defendant would have seen and what effect that observation should have had upon his conduct.</p>

The word ‘practicable’ as used in the statute is not synonymous with the word ‘possible’, nor is it synonymous with the word ‘convenient’. The word ‘practicable’ as our legislature has employed it in that particular statute means ‘feasible’, ‘fair’, ‘reasonable’.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b473-9" data-blocks='[["BL_473.8",473,[993,266,750,523]]]'>The use of the word “feasible” in the Trial Court’s instructions as having the same meaning as “practicable” without further definition or explanation may equally be perplexing to or misinterpreted by the average juror.

    <p id="b473-10" data-blocks='[["BL_473.9",473,[986,861,755,1862]]]'>We have not heretofore had occasion to define the word “practicable” within the intendment of the statute (29 M.R.S.A. § 904 supra). As here employed “practicable” is not synonymous with either “possible” or “convenient”. Clearly, if it is not possible to walk on the left side, it is not “practicable” to do so, but the converse is not necessarily true. In like manner it can be said that it may be “practicable” for a pedestrian to walk on the left side of the highway although not convenient for him to do so. The statute is a part of the highway safety law and the word “practicable” as used in such a statute must be defined with a view to carrying out the underlying purpose of the law. The legislature sought thereby to achieve maximum safety for the traveling public. The particular statute rests on a legislative conclusion that, all things being equal, a pedestrian incurs less risk of injury if he uses the sidewalk and if, absent sidewalks, he walks facing traffic. We can fairly assume, however, that the legislature did not intend to compel one to choose either the sidewalk or his left side of the highway, as the case may be, where such choice would increase his risk of injury from any source. Treating the whole phrase “when practicable, walk only on the left side of the way or its shoulder facing traffic which may approach from the opposite direction”, as meaning what the words indicate, the procedure must be followed unless there is some valid reason why in some particular respect it is not practicable to do so.</p>
