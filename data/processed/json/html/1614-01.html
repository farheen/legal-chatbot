There is, therefore, no need to here discuss the count separately.</p>

    <p id="b957-5" data-blocks='[["BL_957.5",957,[118,688,1331,864]]]'>The examiner rejected claims 16 and 21 as “unpatentable over” Newton. The difference between the disclosures in the Newton patent and the appealed claims resides in the absence of water in the reaction between the polycarbonate and the diisocyanate. It is the examiner’s position that the omission of water and its function from the Newton reaction would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art. The remaining claims were rejected by the examiner as unpatentable over Newton in combination with Marrian and Wilson. The examiner stated that the difference between claims 16 and 21 and the remaining claims resides in the use of the aliphatic polyhydroxy compound in the preparation of the polycarbonate. The present specification shows that with increased additions of the polyhydroxy compound, the final products tend toward hardness and rigidity. Pointing to the above quoted passage from the Newton patent, the examiner contended that it was obvious to incorporate glycerol in the step of preparing the polycarbonate and thereby reduce the resiliency (increase the rigidity) of the final product.</p>
    <p id="b957-6" data-blocks='[["BL_957.6",957,[116,1559,1331,607]]]'>The board generally affirmed the decision of the examiner but, in addition, pointed out: (1) Newton refers to an abandoned application, serial No. 411,927, filed July 7, 1954, for disclosure on how the linear polycarbonates may be prepared and this abandoned application disclosed that the polycarbonates can be made by reaction of glycols with polyehloroformates which are made by phosgenating diols; (2) the disclosure of Wilson pertaining to the polycarboxylate-diisocyanate reaction is clearly in an art analogous to appellants’ polycarbonate-diisocyanate reaction; and (3) appellants have not showil that the final product is substantially different when the polyol is added during the preparation of the polycarbonate rather than during the polycarbonate-diisocyanate reaction.</p>

They point out that the water reacts with the diiso-cyanate to form urea groups which contribute to the stiffness of the final product whereas in the absence of water, the two reactants produce only urethane linkages which are more stable and less stiff. We <a id="p1618" href="#p1618" data-label="1618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1618</a>note, however, that Newton employs -water <em>only </em>as a foam-inducing agent and that his disclosure shows that relatively small amounts of water are used. We therefore agree with the factually-based conclusion of the board and the examiner that it was obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art to omit water from the Newton reaction when its function as a foaming agent was not desired. In the absence of a showing by appellants of an unexpected result flowing from such omission, the subject matter is not patentable. 35 USC 103.</p>
    <p id="b958-3" data-blocks='[["BL_958.4",958,[220,672,1328,832]]]'>The board found that the use of an aliphatic polyhydroxy compound in the reaction, as claimed in appealed claim 26, was obvious in view of Newton, Marrian and Wilson. The above quoted passage from Newton discloses to one of ordinary skill in this art that glycerol may be used in the polycarbonate-diisocyanate reaction at the expense of resiliency, elasticity and softness. In other words, Newton teaches the making of a relatively rigid product by the use of glycerol in the reaction. Newton’s disclosure implies that <em>glycerol, </em>if used at all, is introduced during the polycarbonate-diisocyanate reaction. However, Marrian discloses the preparation of polyesters by the reaction of a dialkyl carbonate with a polyhydroxy compound having three or more hydroxyl groups. Wilson discloses a method for making a polyester from a dicarboxylic acid, a glycol and glycerol. These disclosures provide a proper factual basis for the determination of obviousness of the claimed invention under the conditions stated in 35 USC 103.</p>
