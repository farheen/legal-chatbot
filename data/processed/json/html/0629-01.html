In addressing this question, <em>Jones </em>discusses the interplay between double jeopardy principles, Supreme Court caselaw, and Section 9765. In authoring the lead opinion, Justice Castille adopted a “practical, hybrid approach” that requires courts to “evaluate the statutory elements [of each crime], with an eye to the specific allegations leveled in the case.” Justices Cappy and Baer joined Justice Castille’s lead opinion. Justice Newman, joined by Justice Eakin, wrote a dissent favoring the adoption of a “statutory elements” test in accordance with Section 9765. Justice Saylor generally agreed with Justice Newman’s dissenting opinion as to the “statutory elements” test, but concurred in the result of the lead opinion because the criminal act at issue pre-dated the effective date of § 9765.</blockquote>

In that there are distinct elements that support the crimes of rape and statutory sexual assault, such crimes are not greater and lesser included offenses.
