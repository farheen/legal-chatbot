Analyzing the board’s opinion, it further becomes apparent that the following conclusions are implicit therein: first, that the newly-cited references contained teachings pertinent and critical to a position pressed by the examiner in his answer; second, that the position maintained in that Answer involved a change substantial enough to be <a id="p1375" href="#p1375" data-label="1375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1375</a>considered a new ground of rejection; and third, that appellant’s brief did not contain an adequate response to that new ground of rejection.</p>

See, e.g., 35 USC 7. The action taken here, if dispositive, was so only in a procedural sense. Any error involved was solely an abuse of discretion.

    <p id="b698-4" data-blocks='[["BL_698.4",698,[218,392,1330,993]]]'>The appeal in <em>Sundback </em>v. <em>Blair </em>was from a decision of the Board of Appeals in a proceeding authorized by rule rather than statute. Section 4904 of the patent statute then in force read in relevant part: “Whenever an application is made for a patent which, <em>in the opinion of the </em>commissioner, would interfere with any pending application or with any unexpired patent, <em>he </em>shall give notice thereof to the applicants, or applicant and patentee, as the case may be, and shall direct the primary examiner to proceed to determine the question of priority of invention.” (Emphasis mine.) However, the Commissioner had delegated that authority, providing ¡by rule that motions to dissolve an interference should be heard and determined by a law examiner and that appeal from such a decision of a law examiner was to the Board of Appeals. Thus the decision of the law examiner appealed to the Board of Appeals was, as this court then decided, in legal effect the decision of the Commissioner. Similarly, the decision of the board on appeal from the law examiner’s decision was in legal effect the decision of the Commissioner and therefore not reviewable by us for the same reason that decisions actually, personally made by the Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner acting as his delegee are ordinarily not reviewable by us.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

Granted, its decision was based on a Patent Office rule rather than a statute, but the Commissioner is authorized by statute, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, to “establish regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of proceedings in the Patent Office.” 35 USC 6. These regulations, if approved by the Secretary of Commerce and not inconsistent with statutory, constitutional, or treaty law, have the force and effect of law. <em>Vandenberg </em>v. Reynolds, <a href="/ccpa/46-2/0938-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="46 C.C.P.A. 938" data-case-ids="6080340" data-case-paths="/ccpa/46-2/0938-01">46 CCPA 938</a>, 940, <a href="/f2d/268/0744-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="268 F.2d 744" data-case-ids="1972956,6080340" data-case-paths="/f2d/268/0744-01,/ccpa/46-2/0938-01">268 F. 2d 744</a>, 746, <a href="/ccpa/46-2/0938-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="46 C.C.P.A. 938" data-case-ids="6080340" data-case-paths="/ccpa/46-2/0938-01">122 USPQ 381</a>, 382 (1959). And for all practical purposes they <em>are </em>law, the same as statutory law. A decision of the board interpreting such a regulation is no less a decision of the board subject to our review than a decision of the board interpreting a statute, the Constitution, or a treaty. A decision of the board on a statutory appeal interpreting a regulation esablished by the Commissioner stands on a very different footing from a decision (whether interpreting a statute, a rule, or opinions <a id="p1377" href="#p1377" data-label="1377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1377</a>of this or any other court) in a proceeding in which the entire proceeding consists, as it did in the <em>SundbacJe </em>case, only of the exercise of delegated authority.</p>

    <p id="b699-5" data-blocks='[["BL_699.5",699,[92,671,1326,796]]]'>As far as the first of these grounds is concerned, it is well established that we will not decide interlocutory appeals. <em>United States Treasury </em>v. <em>Synthetic Plastics Co., </em><a href="/ccpa/52-2/0967-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="52 C.C.P.A. 967" data-case-ids="12164333" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/0967-01">52 CCPA 967</a>, <a href="/ccpa/52-2/0967-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="341 F.2d 157" data-case-ids="12164333,878477" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/0967-01,/f2d/341/0157-01">341 F. 2d 157</a>, <a href="/ccpa/52-2/0967-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="52 C.C.P.A. 967" data-case-ids="12164333" data-case-paths="/ccpa/52-2/0967-01">144 USPQ 429</a> (1965). Indeed, the <em>United States Treasury </em>case seems to have raised that principle to a requirement of jurisdiction in trademark cases, and I see no need to question the majority’s assumption that the word “decision” (of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board) in 15 USC 1071, construed in that case, has the same meaning as the word “decision” (of the Patent Office Board of Appeals) in 35 USC 141, construed in this case. All that that case required, and all that I think we should require in this case, is that the decision be “a dis-positive decision in which a right has been adjudicated.” In this case there is no doubt that a right has been adjudicated (the applicant’s right to have his appeal heard on the merits by the Board of Appeals), and there is no doubt that the decision was dispositive (the applicant will have lost his claims unless <em>someone </em>reverses the Board).</p>
    <p id="b699-6" data-blocks='[["BL_699.6",699,[93,1474,1324,337]]]'>The majority, however, has read an additional requirement into our version of the interlocutory appeals rule.

This deference is compelled by no statute, and <a id="p1378" href="#p1378" data-label="1378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1378</a>there can be no doubt that we do have the authority to review matters of Patent Office procedure when properly presented to us. Only last spring, in a unanimous decision delivered by Judge Baldwin, this court held an examiner’s refusal to permit entry of an amendment into the official record to be an “adverse decision” properly reviewable, first by the Board of Appeals under 35 USC 7 and then by ns under 35 USC 141. <em>In re </em>Searles, <a href="/ccpa/57-2/0912-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="57 C.C.P.A. 912" data-case-ids="6092708" data-case-paths="/ccpa/57-2/0912-01">57 CCPA 912</a>, 915-17, <a href="/f2d/422/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="422 F.2d 431" data-case-ids="2254896,6092708" data-case-paths="/f2d/422/0431-01,/ccpa/57-2/0912-01">422 F. 2d 431</a>, 43A-35, <a href="/ccpa/57-2/0912-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="57 C.C.P.A. 912" data-case-ids="6092708" data-case-paths="/ccpa/57-2/0912-01">164 USPQ 623</a>, 625-26 (1970). The opinion correctly noted that “traditionally, such actions being considered procedural, rather than substantive, recourse was available only through petition to the Commissioner of Patents, review of his decisions being possible by means of civil action” (footnote omitted), but we found jurisdiction (1) because the act was “determinative of the rejection” (the interlocutory appeals rule again, in different guise), and (2) because it “required the exercise of technical skill and legal judgment in order to evaluate the facts presented, interpret the requirements of 35 USC 116 <em>and Rule lj.5 </em>and weigh the facts against those requirements.” (Emphasis mine.)</p>
