Given these conclusions, the trial court denied Appellant’s suppression motion. The case then proceeded to trial at which the transcripts for the suppression motion and the preliminary hearing were incorporated into the record. The parties also stipulated as to the make and model of the gun, the fact that it was loaded, and the fact that Appellant had $8,735.00 on his person. It was also stipulated that Appellant did not have a license to carry the gun. The trial court found sufficient evidence to support the firearms violation charge, and Appellant was sentenced immediately thereafter.</p>

Appellant asserts that because this detention occurred prior to any observation of a gun being dropped,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> no probable cause or reasonable suspicion existed to justify the detention. He further asserts that no statutory authority existed to permit such a detention. As a consequence, continues Appellant, any alleged “reasonable suspicion” that he was “armed and dangerous,” which may have existed as a result of his furtive movements, occurred as a result of and during an illegal detention. Thus, Appellant argues that the fruits of the illegal search should have been suppressed. In the alternative, Appellant argues that, even if this Court were to find that no illegal detention initially occurred, his action in reaching in his pants did not create sufficient reasonable suspicion to conclude that he was armed and dangerous. We cannot agree.</p>
