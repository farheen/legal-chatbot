    <p id="b171-9" data-blocks='[["BL_171.8",171,[184,871,751,466]]]'>Defendant, Jay Dorbolo, appeals his Superior Court jury convictions of two charges of felony theft and one charge of conspiracy, contending that the Trial Court erred in admitting inculpatory oral statements made by defendant without a sufficient showing of a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent and his right to the assistance of counsel during interrogation.</p>

Following an evidentiary suppression hearing held outside the presence of the jury, the Trial Judge, announcing his ruling from the bench, denied the motion with the following observations:</p>
    <blockquote id="b171-12" data-blocks='[["BL_171.11",171,[225,1927,713,799]],["BL_171.12",171,[1017,281,714,721]]]'>“To sum it all up, I credit the testimony of Officer Rees. After being advised of his rights, and he admits that that happened, that he was aware of his rights, he said, “I’m willing to talk to you, but I won’t sign a statement until I consult with a lawyer.” I make this finding in part because of my assessment of the Defendant’s demeanor. He is like Miss Campo, young, but is very much unlike her in personality and in form of sophistication. He strikes me as glib and flip. He is a person who was aware that he was wanted for this charge for three months, or at least two months. I think he said three months. He was making arrangements on his own to make sure that he had bail when the time came for him to be placed in custody. I don’t think he was intimidated at all. I think, frankly, he just outfoxed himself a little. I think he was playing games with the police. I don’t know whether he thought in his own mind that only a written statement could be used, and not an oral statement. There is no point in trying to figure out what was going on in his own mind. I think he was playing games, thought he was helping himself, and it turns out he made some admissions. Under the circumstances, I find no reason to suppress those admissions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b171-14" data-blocks='[["BL_171.13",171,[1020,1022,713,673]]]'>While it is a red light and a danger signal when one hears that there was any mention of a lawyer, one looks closely. I don’t believe this is the situation where the police just ignored an absolute request for a lawyer, but rather happened as Officer Rees said it happened. I don’t think this is a case where there was a slick officer taking advantage of an ignorant defendant who is under pressure, but simply the defendant decided that he would talk for his own reasons, but that he wouldn’t sign any statements until he talked to a lawyer.</blockquote>

I think they have no affirmative obligation to cease questioning at that point because the Defendant indicated a willingness to talk. The Defendant admits that he knew that he had been advised of his rights, understood them. There was no statement on his part that he was misled in any way. The rights say nothing about written statements, but really are slanted, I would submit, more towards oral statements. So the Defendant was probably caught in his own sophistication in that area. I think the case is distinguishable from the ones that are cited by the defendant, where there was a request to see a lawyer and a very different kind of defendant and police officers used some kind of a ruse to get the defendant to talk in spite of that request. So on the <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>factual basis, the motion to suppress the incriminating statements is denied. Of course, if there is testimony on the issue, I will instruct the jury appropriately, if there is dispute in the trial itself as to whether any admission was actually made. I will allow them to ultimately find that fact.”</blockquote>
