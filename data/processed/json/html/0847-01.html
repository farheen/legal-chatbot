There is no similarity of appearance in the designs. The words, when pronounced, do not have the same sound, except the one word “ Park,” which can not, standing alone, be taken as the dominating characteristic of either of the marks. It is not contended that anyone can secure the exclusive right to use the word “ Park,” and we do not understand the law to deny registration to one combination which includes part of another combination unless the former is so similar to the latter as to create confusion.</p>

    <p id="b300-18" data-blocks='[["BL_300.18",300,[226,1750,1319,394]]]'>College dress is a “ fashion ” or “ prevailing mode ” adopted by college men; the words “ College Park,” used by appellee, indicate such fashion and appellant’s mark includes it, as the testimony conclusively shows. Therefore, as applied to- clothing worn by college students, at least, both marks have exactly the same significance, and it necessarily follows that the two marks are likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public, especially that part of it to which both parties cater, viz, college men.</p>

      <a id="p851" href="#p851" data-label="851" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*851</a>Tlie reason for this rule is that the field from which a person may select a trade-mark is practically unlimited, and hence there is no excuse for impinging upon or even closely approaching the mark of a business rival.</blockquote>
    <p id="b301-3" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[133,377,1319,295]]]'>In the case at bar, appellee had thousands of words from which to select a trade-mark. There was no reason why it should select the particular combination of the words “ College ” and “ Park,” unless it vras to approach as nearly as possible to the mark of appellant without infringement, and profit by purchasers thinking that the clothes made by it were those made by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[133,680,1320,394]]]'>It has been held that it is the duty of the Patent Office to refuse registration to one whose use of the mark has been of such deceptive character that a court of equity would deny him protection. <em>Coffin Redington Company </em>v. <em>Turner, </em><a href="/app-dc/46/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 App. D.C. 449" data-case-ids="1779548" data-case-paths="/app-dc/46/0449-01">46 App. D.

It as been held in many cases that the law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition.</p>

    <p id="b301-7" data-blocks='[["BL_301.8",301,[132,1341,1320,798]]]'>If appellee had desired in good faith to adopt a trade-mark “ to protect his good will against the sale of another’s product as his,” it would seem that he would have selected a mark so dissimilar to the mark of a competitor that there would be no possibility of confusion. If it desired to use the word “ College ” as a part of its mark it had a perfect right to do so, but why did it select the word “ Park ” to use in combination with the word “ College ” when it must have known that a strong competitor was using the word “ Park ” in combination with the word “ Fashion” ? There are hundreds, if not thousands, of words that might have been used by appellee instead of the word “ Park,” or a like number that might have been used in combination with the word “ College.” The conclusion to me is irresistible that in selecting the words “ College Park,” appellee hoped to secure a benefit from appellant’s mark by reason of their similarity, and I am of the opinion that there was ample ground for such hope.</p>
    <p id="b301-8" data-blocks='[["BL_301.9",301,[132,2143,1320,348]],["BL_302.1",302,[239,243,1323,142]]]'>The majority opinion makes mention of the fact that no confusion was-shown in the testimony and no effort was made to show it. Proof of actual confusion is always very difficult to secure. Search would have to be made among customers to find those who had been misled.

The language of the statute is: “Likely to cause confusion or mistake.” <a id="p852" href="#p852" data-label="852" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*852</a>The law is that the mere probability of confusion as a result of the use of the marks by the respective parties is sufficient. <em>Rockwood Pottery Co. </em>v. <em>A.

The question involved was whether the said mark of appellee so nearly resembled the marks of appellant as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public,, or to deceive purchasers. We there held that the words “ Park ” and “ Lane,” in combination with the word “ Fashion ” and the other elements of the respective marks, <em>as applied to the various goods upon which they were used, </em>were not so similar as to cause confusion. Had the marks in that case been used upon identical goods, as are the marks here involved, a very different question would have been before us. It is clear that marks may be so similar as to cause confusion if used upon goods identical in kind, but so dissimilar that no confusion would arise if used on goods not identical in kind.</p>
