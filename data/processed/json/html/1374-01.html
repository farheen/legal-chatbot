    <p id="b1439-24" data-blocks='[["BL_1439.24",1439,[944,1356,751,1086]]]'>Between 1983 and 1992, Chester High-house sporadically drove buses for Avery Transportation, which was owned by Frank Avery and his son, Lyle Avery. In 1990, Highhouse accepted employment as a truck driver by Scranton Craftsmen Company. On May 14, 1990, he received a telephone call from Nancy Avery, the wife of Lyle Avery, requesting that he remain with Avery and continue to drive buses. At that time, High-house sought to determine Avery’s policy regarding unemployment benefits because of the cyclical nature of Avery’s business. Each year during the months of May to September, Avery’s drivers were busy, but after September business gradually slowed until, between December and March, there was little or no work at all. Avery’s bus drivers were not paid a salary but were paid twenty (20%) percent of the price charged to customers for each chartered bus trip. Thus, a driver’s earnings were dependent upon his being assigned to bus trips.</p>

To make ends meet, he said, he applied for and received unemployment compensation. Thereafter, appellant said, the frequency and quality of his assignments were reduced, and con<a id="p1376" href="#p1376" data-label="1376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1376</a>versations with management implied that he would have to agree not to apply for unemployment compensation if he were to be successful at Avery. Highhouse refused to agree. The following year, Highhouse applied for unemployment compensation. On or about January 16, 1992, Lyle Avery advised Highhouse that all Avery drivers were scheduled to have a federally mandated drug test and that he could be tested at his own expense, if he wished, but that his services would not be used by Avery except in emergency situations. When Highhouse inquired about his failure to receive the,- bonus received by other drivers at Christmas, he was told that his unemployment check was his bonus. Thereafter, Highhouse did not take the drug test. His employer contends that he thereby terminated his employment voluntarily. Highhouse contends, however, that he understood his conversation with Lyle Avery to mean that his employment had been terminated and that the cost of the test would be wasted money. He argues that he was thereby discharged, either actually or constructively, by Avery.</p>

Constructive discharge of an at-will employee may serve as a basis for tort recovery if the employer has made working conditions so intolerable that an employee has been forced to resign. <em>Kroen v.

Here, there was evidence that management had denied appellant a Christmas bonus and had told him that he would be the last person assigned to a trip and that it would be only in a “dire emergency” that he would be given an assignment. The reason for this was management’s displeasure with appellant’s accepting unemployment compensation during the winter months when he had received no assignments. A jury could find that this evidence, if believed, constituted a constructive discharge and that appellant’s failure to take a mandated drug test was not a voluntary decision to terminate his employment.</p>

The second and third counts attempted to state causes of action for breach of contract based either on consideration or promissory estoppel. These counts, as we have observed, failed to state legally cognizable causes of action, and they were properly dismissed by the trial court. The fourth count, which alleged an intentional infliction of emotional distress was dismissed by the trial court and has not been argued on appeal. On remand, therefore, it is only the first count, which alleges a discharge in violation of public policy, which requires further proceedings.</p>
