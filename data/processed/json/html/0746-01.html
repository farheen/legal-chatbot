Cambrel argues on appeal that his sentence is invalid because the trial court (1) relied in part on allegedly impermissible factors in deciding not to sentence appellant under the YCA, and (2) gave an explanation for its rejection of YCA sentencing which assertedly was so insufficiently reasoned as to deny appellant due process of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We affirm.</p>
