Gaines guilty of two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. The verdict was based on evidence that appellant, a twenty-four-year-old black male, dropped a bag containing multiple packets of cocaine and marijuana as he fled on foot from police officers who had just stopped him in his car for driving while using a cellular telephone without a hands-free device in violation of District of Columbia law. On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court impermissibly curtailed his Sixth Amendment right to expose the officers’ biases and prejudices through cross-examination concerning their pretextual reliance on minor traffic violations as grounds to stop and search suspects for drugs and, in particular, their selective enforcement of the hands-free law against black males. Appellant also contends that the trial court gave an unbalanced jury instruction on flight and erroneously allowed the government to elicit an opinion from its drug expert on the ultimate issue of his intent to distribute. We find no reversible error and accordingly affirm appellant’s convictions.</p>

At approximately 11:45 p.m., the officers — Glenn and Jordan in one car, and Hairston and Heraud in the other — drove in tandem eastbound through the 1200 block of Raum Street, N.E. toward an apartment building on the corner known to the officers for drug use and other drug-related crime. The officers traveled eastbound on the one-way westbound street hoping to catch drug dealers out in front of the building by surprise.</p>

Appellant, too, was driving slowly, and the officers were able to see him by looking directly into his car through its driver’s-side front <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>window. Officer Heraud saw a portion of appellant’s face, and Officers Heraud and Glenn both observed that appellant was using his left hand to hold a cellular telephone to his left ear in apparent violation of D.C.Code § 50-1731.04(a) (2004), which prohibits the use of a cellular telephone while driving except with a hands-free device. The officers discussed their observations over the police radio and decided to make a traffic stop. They turned their scout cars around, followed appellant through an alley, and tried to effect a stop in the 1200 block of Simms Place, N.E.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[125,1005,757,610]]]'>Appellant promptly pulled over to the curb in response to the scout cars’ lights and sirens. Before any of the officers could approach to investigate, however, appellant jumped out of his car and took off running. Officer Heraud chased appellant on foot down Simms Place and into an alley on the north side of the block. It was a bitterly cold night, with recently fallen snow and ice covering the ground, and the footing was treacherous for both appellant and Officer Heraud.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[123,1641,756,862]]]'>Officer Heraud testified that as appellant led him around a turn in the alley he observed appellant reach into his left front pants pocket and pull out a black plastic bag rolled up in a ball. Officer Heraud testified further that without breaking stride appellant dropped the bag to the snow- and ice-covered ground and continued running, with Officer Heraud in pursuit approximately ten feet behind. Appellant and Officer Heraud soon emerged from the alley onto Mount Olivet Road, N.E., still separated by a few feet. Appellant, however, slipped and fell on some ice in front of a convenience store on Mount Olivet Road, and Officer Heraud apprehended him.</p>

Officer Heraud testified that within a minute and a half he found the bag lying on top of the snow and ice in the same location in which he had seen appellant drop it during the chase. The officers recovered the bag and found inside of it seventeen zip-lock bags containing a white rock substance (later proven to be cocaine) and ten zip-lock bags containing a green weed substance (later proven to be marijuana). The officers arrested appellant for possession with intent to distribute, and in a search incident to the arrest they seized $307.62 in small bills from appellant’s person. The officers subsequently issued appellant a traffic ticket for violating the hands-free law, although they did not recover a cellular telephone from appellant’s person or seize or take photographs of a cellular telephone Officer Her-aud testified he observed inside appellant’s car following the arrest.</p>

Appellant argued that the officers’ ulterior motives in stopping him for the hands-free violation showed their bias against him and cast doubt on Officer Heraud’s testimony that he dropped the bag of cocaine and marijuana during the foot chase through the alley.</p>

Counsel told the jury that this was “a case about police harassment, about police manufacturing an excuse ... to stop somebody and harass [him] and search [him] for drugs.” Counsel continued, adding a suggestion that the officers focused their at<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>tention on appellant because he is a black male: “And they manufacture this not because they’re interested in issuing a ticket for using a cell phone without a hands-free device; they do it because they want to stop somebody, a black male driving a car, so that they can search for drugs.” “[T]he evidence will show that ... the police are biased, they have a bias against [appellant], and they’re biased against him because they’re looking to just manufacture a drug case. And because the police are biased, because they are manufacturing this case, because [they are] harassing somebody, we expect that there will be questions as to the credibility of the police.”</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[212,1161,752,604]]]'>Officer Glenn was the government’s first witness at trial. He told the jury on direct examination about his observations of appellant holding what appeared to be a cellular telephone to his ear while driving and about the officers’ efforts to effect a traffic stop. In response to a question from the prosecutor, Officer Glenn explained that he and his partners “commonly initiate traffic stops over things like cell phones” because violations of traffic laws lead to accidents if the police do not intervene.</p>

Specifically, appellant’s counsel asked Officer Glenn whether the officers were trained “about ways that [they] can stop cars and commence searches of those cars.” Officer Glenn answered “Yes.” Yet when appellant’s counsel then sought to pose a follow-up question (“And one of the things that you’re taught about is how to make traffic stops so that you can go ahead -and search cars and ask for — ”), the government objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The court explained that in denying a pretrial motion to suppress, it had already determined that the officers observed appellant violating the hands-free law and that the stop of appellant therefore was lawful under the Fourth Amendment even if it was pretex-tual, <em>i.e. </em>even if it was motivated by investigative interests beyond the enforcement of the hands-free law. <em>See Whren v.

    <blockquote id="b434-9" data-blocks='[["BL_434.9",434,[241,1262,715,756]]]'>A person who flees or hides after a crime has been committed or after he has been accused of a crime may be motivated by a variety of factors. You may, for example, consider flight or concealment as a circumstance tending to show feelings of guilt, and you may consider feelings of guilt as tending to show actual guilt. On the other hand, flight or concealment does not create a presumption of guilt, nor does it necessarily reflect that the person has feelings of guilt. You may not, therefore, presume a defendant is guilty merely because he fled or concealed himself.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b434-10" data-blocks='[["BL_434.10",434,[240,2045,713,247]]]'>If you find evidence of flight or concealment, you should consider and weigh such evidence along with all the other evidence in the case and give it the weight you think it deserves.</blockquote>

Appellant established on cross-examination of Officer Heraud that he was driving without a license at the time he was stopped, and he argued in closing that it was his lack of a driver’s license, rather than his alleged possession of cocaine and marijuana, that caused him to run from the police. Given the strength of the government’s evidence and the forcefulness with which appellant put his theory of innocent flight before the jury, we are “able to ‘say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.’ ” <em>Hinton v.
