Moorhead (“Moorhead”) on appeal from his conviction of murder in the second degree after a jury trial in the Superior Court. Moorhead’s principal grounds for overturning his conviction are as follows: (a) the Superior Court erred in admitting evidence of two prior convictions of Moorhead for driving under the influence (“DUI”); (b) the Superior Court should not have excluded evidence offered by Moorhead of his prior “good act”; (c) the State’s expert testimony regarding the effects of alcohol on driving should not have been admitted; and (d) the instructions setting forth the elements of murder in the second degree were erroneous: After reviewing the record and the applicable authorities, we find that none of these contentions constitutes reversible error by the Superior Court. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>

We do not find the two convictions, which occurred between three and six years prior to the accident in this case, to be excessively remote. It is also significant that the Superior Court excluded Moorhead’s 1983 conviction for reckless driving because it was too remote in time. This decision shows that the Superior Court carefully considered the time nexus between the prior convictions offered by the State and the crime currently at issue.</p>

Balancing the probative value of the evidence to be introduced against any unfairly prejudicial effect is required by D.R.E. 403 and is a key element in a <em>Getz </em>analysis. While much of the evidence offered by the State against a defendant is necessarily prejudicial to some degree, the admission of evidence becomes unfairly prejudicial when the evidence has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Fed.R.Evid. 403 advisory committee’s note.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

We need not decide whether or not the prior convictions might have had an unfairly prejudicial effect if there had been a highly contested dispute whether Moorhead had actually been intoxicated while driving. Moorhead concedes that he was intoxicated while driving, but contends that he did not have a “cruel, wicked and depraved indifference to human life” as required for murder in the second degree under 11 <em>DelC. </em>§ 635. The Superior Court had discretion to find that Moorhead’s prior convictions were probative on this issue while not being unfairly prejudicial.</p>

Moreover, while the DUI convictions did bear directly on Moor-head’s state of mind when he drove in an intoxicated condition in 1992, the 1970 “heroic” act had no relationship to his 1992 state of mind or any element of the crime charged.

Specifically, Dr. Hameli testified that a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent is four times more likely to be involved in an accident than a sober person, and a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20 percent is 28 times more likely to be involved in an accident than a sober person. Moorhead’s blood alcohol concentration was 0.22 percent. Moorhead does not dispute the qualifications of Dr. Hameli or the accuracy of his testimony. Rather, Moorhead claims that the statistical information provided by Dr. Hameli was not relevant to Moorhead’s intent because the State failed to establish that Moorhead knew of those statistics.

Specifically, Moorhead contends that the inclusion of both “willfully” and “not deliberate” in the follow<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>ing portion of the jury instruction was contradictory and improper:</p>

    <p id="b118-6" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[172,774,753,1175]]]'>We do not find the instruction to be contradictory or improper as Moorhead claims. The phrase “voluntary and willfully done” clearly refers to the nature of the defendant’s act. By contrast, the phrase “not deliberate” applies not to the act, but to the consequence of the act (i.e., the destruction of a human life). Thus, the act causing the murder must have been intentionally performed, but the homicidal result need not be deliberate. Although it would have been preferable if the instruction to the jury had contained a more detailed explanation of the meaning of “not deliberate,” this Court has recognized that “some inaccuracies and inaptness in statement are to be expected in any charge.” <em>Baker, </em><a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20103" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="57 A.2d 103">57 A.2d at 109</a>. Because the descriptive phrase “voluntary and willfully done” follows immediately after “the act” in contrast to the phrase “not deliberate” which follows the description of the consequence of the act (the “tendency to destroy the life of another”), we conclude that the instruction correctly stated the law and posed little risk of confusion.</p>
    <p id="b118-7" data-blocks='[["BL_118.7",118,[170,1996,748,273]]]'>Moorhead’s other challenges to the Superior Court’s jury instructions relate to apparent misstatements by the trial judge. First, in describing the type of recklessness that is necessary for murder in the second degree, the trial court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b118-8" data-blocks='[["BL_118.8",118,[208,2288,712,229]]]'>A cruel, wicked and depraved indifference to human life can be found if the act of the defendant is so fraught with danger that it would be likely to cause death or serious bodily injury to another.</blockquote>

Although Moorhead is correct that the reference to “serious bodily harm” was erroneous because the type of recklessness being described pertains to murder in the second degree, the remainder of the instruction indicates little risk that the jury would have been misled or confused. In particular, the trial judge instructed the jury that “in order to convict a defendant of murder in the second degree, you must find that the defendant was aware of and consciously disregarded the risk that the conduct would cause death.... ” Defendant’s Appendix at A-176 (emphasis added). When read in context, therefore, the Superior Court’s instructions regarding the type of recklessness required for murder in the second degree were not misleading. <em>Cf. Probst v. State, </em>Del.Supr., <a href="/a2d/547/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="547 A.2d 114" data-case-ids="7876260" data-case-paths="/a2d/547/0114-01">547 A.2d 114</a>, 119-20 (1988) (holding that a jury instruction was misleading where the erroneous language was repeatedly stated, thereby creating a likelihood of jury confusion).</p>
    <p id="b118-11" data-blocks='[["BL_118.11",118,[971,1180,749,464]]]'>Second, the trial judge mistakenly interjected “second degree murder” when he summarized the elements of manslaughter. This inadvertent reference evidently was not detected by defense counsel, who did not object to it at trial, nor by anyone else who was present. After reviewing the entire instruction regarding manslaughter, we find virtually no risk that the jury was confused by the trial judge’s misstatement.</p>
    <p id="b118-12" data-blocks='[["BL_118.12",118,[969,1667,747,515]]]'>The Superior Court began the manslaughter charge by telling the jury: “In order to find the defendant guilty of manslaughter, you must find that all of the following elements have been established by the State beyond a reasonable doubt.” Defendant’s Appendix at A-180 (emphasis added). After setting forth the elements of manslaughter, and immediately following the inadvertent reference to second degree murder, the Superior Court concluded:</p>
    <blockquote id="b118-13" data-blocks='[["BL_118.13",118,[1006,2197,708,419]]]'>If, after considering all of the evidence, you find that the State has established beyond a reasonable doubt that [the elements of the crime occurred] ... you should find the defendant guilty of manslaughter.

Any possible confusion from the <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>erroneous reference to second degree murder was manifestly cured by this concluding passage. <em>See Dawson v.

Although Moorhead has pointed out certain minor errors in the instructions, none of these posed a material risk of confusion among the jury.

    <p id="b119-9" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[208,1334,751,508]]]'>We hold that the Superior Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of Moorhead’s DUI convictions in 1986 and 1989. It thoroughly considered each of the guidelines established by this Court in <em>Getz, </em>and we see no basis for finding its conclusion to be arbitrary or capricious. The Superior Court also properly exercised its discretion when it excluded evidence of Moorhead’s “good act” in 1970 because that act was too remote in time.</p>
    <p id="b119-10" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[1007,213,750,605]]]'>Similarly, we find no error in the admission of Dr. Hameli’s expert testimony regarding the relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the likelihood of an automobile accident. The trial judge properly weighed the probative value of such evidence against the potential for unfair prejudice, and decided that Dr. Hameli’s testimony was relevant to an issue in dispute, was probative on that issue, and had no unfairly prejudicial effect. We find no abuse of discretion in this part of the Superior Court’s decision.</p>
