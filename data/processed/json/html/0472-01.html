Three issues require our resolution. First, Mr. Psaroma-tis contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he was required to settle on the purchase of the property before he received insurable title. Second, Mr. Psa-romatis contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he forfeited his deposit paid to English Holdings for the purchase of the property. Third, English Holdings asserts that Mr. Psaromatis was required to compensate it for fees incurred in defending against claims raised by the property’s tenants. We reverse as to the first two issues and affirm on the third issue.</p>
    <p id="b521-12" data-blocks='[["BL_521.11",521,[894,284,755,1696]]]'>In reaching our conclusion, we discuss each issue in turn and conclude that a condition precedent existed by which Mr. Psaromatis’s obligation to close was conditioned upon the ability of English Holdings to convey insurable title to Mr. Psaromatis that was free of any tenant’s claims. Because English Holdings was not in a position to do this, it was English Holdings— not Mr. Psaromatis — that defaulted under the agreement, and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise. Mr. Psaromatis was therefore entitled, under the terms of the agreement, to the return of his deposit. He was also entitled to pursue an equitable action for specific performance in the trial court. Therefore, we must reverse so that the trial court may order a full refund of Mr. Psaromatis’s deposit because there was no prejudice to either English Holdings or the Tenants’ Association in light of Mr. Psaromatis’s reasonable resort to his statutory remedy of a Notice of <em>Lis Pen-dens. </em>As to English Holdings’s claim for counsel fees, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award English Holdings the counsel fees it sought from Mr. Psaromatis. The purchase agreement between English Holdings and Mr. Psaromatis did not authorize recovery of counsel fees for disputes concerning a third party — here, the Tenant’s Association.</p>

In 2003, English Holdings retained the firm of Marcus &amp; Millichap for the purpose of listing and selling the property. The firm presented English Holdings with an offer from Mr. Psaromatis to buy the property, and on March 3, 2003, the parties entered into a contract (the “first purchase agree<a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>ment”). Under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Mr. Psaromatis was to purchase 100% of the member interests of English Holdings for $1,050,000, with an initial deposit of $52,800.

Finally, Mr. Psaromatis advised English Holdings that the noted objections “must be answered, cured, or resolved in accordance with the [second purchase] Agreement.” English Holdings, through its agent Ms. Lloyd, responded to Mr. Psaromatis’s objections the same day via a letter, stating: “All objections detailed in your notice dated April 23, 2003, regarding title commitment for 1208 M Street, Washington, DC will <em>be satisfied prior either to dosing or by affidavit at dosing.” </em>(Emphasis added).</p>

Pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that the terms and conditions of the second purchase agreement would remain the same, except that the time for settlement would be extended to allow English Holdings an opportunity to provide a new offer of sale to the Tenants’ Association pursuant to the TOPA. <em>See </em>D.C.Code § 42-3404.02. Pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Settlement Agreement, English Holdings was required to “proceed under the [TOPA] so that the Property [could] be conveyed to [Mr.] Psaromatis <em>free of any claims by the tenants </em>thereunder.” (Emphasis added).

In response to a request from English Holdings’s counsel to release the notice, Mr. Psaromatis advised English Holdings that he would release the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>if adequate assurances were provided by English Holdings that proceeds from the sale of the property, or other assets of English Holdings, would be available to satisfy a possible money judgment against English Holdings (such as for return of Mr. Psaromatis’s deposit). According to Mr. Psaromatis, he was concerned that if the property was sold to the Tenants’ Association, English Holdings would own no assets because the M Street property was its sole asset.

However, Mr. Psaromatis refused to close on the sale because of his concerns about the ongoing TOPA claims by the Tenants’ Association in regard to the property. On November 12, 2004, Mr. Psaromatis advised English Holdings of his concerns with the continued existence of the tenants’ claims to purchase the property and reminded English Holdings of the requirement that those claims be resolved as a condition of the second purchase agreement, the Addendum to the second purchase agreement, and the Settlement Agreement. In response, English Holdings contended that because an offer of sale was made and accepted by the tenants, it met its obligations with respect to TOPA under both the second purchase agreement and the Settlement Agreement, and rejected Mr. Psaromatis’s reading of the Settlement Agreement to mean that English Holdings agreed to convey the property free of “all” claims. English Holdings did, however, extend the closing date to November 24, 2004, to allow Mr. Psaromatis to obtain an updated title commitment. No further demand for settlement was made by English Holdings. In a letter dated November 24, 2004, English Holdings advised Mr. Psaro-matis that it deemed his failure to close on the purchase of the property as a default of the contract, and therefore, it was terminating the contract with Mr. Psaromatis.</p>

Similarly, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Addendum to the second purchase agreement provided Mr. Psaromatis with the right to terminate the agreement and receive a refund' of his deposit if English Holdings failed to comply with the TOPA. Therefore, the trial court found that Mr. Psaromatis had a “choice” to make under the contract once the tenants manifested an interest in purchasing the property: he could terminate the purchase agreement and receive a refund of his full deposit, or he could proceed to settlement. What Mr. Psaromatis could not do, according to the trial court, “was what he did do.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">10</a> For these reasons, the trial court concluded that Mr. Psaromatis was not entitled to a decree of specific performance and that he defaulted on the contract by refusing to go to settlement.

As noted <em>supra, </em>on April 23, 2003, nineteen months before the time English Holdings demanded settlement, Mr. Psaromatis sent a letter to English Holdings outlining his objections to the exceptions in the title commitment issued by First American Title Insurance Company. In this letter, Mr. Psaromatis objected to, <em>inter alia, </em>the exception concerning the “rights of tenants under the Rental Housing Conversion and Sales Act,” and further advised English Holdings that the requirements, found in Schedule B, Section One of the Title Commitment, must also be satisfied, to the extent that those requirements were under English Holdings’s control, including the requirement that proof of compliance with the Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act be furnished to the satisfaction of the title company. Finally, Mr. Psaromatis advised English Holdings that his objections “must be answered, cured, or resolved in accordance with the [second purchase] Agreement.” In response, English Holdings promised to satisfy <em>all </em>of Mr. Psaromatis’s objections prior to closing, or by affidavit at closing. English Holdings contends that neither the second purchase agreement, the Addendum, nor the Settlement Agreement, unequivocally required the conveyance of insurable title, free of any claims by the tenants. Instead, English Holdings argues that Mr. Psaromatis was bound by the provisions of Paragraph 3 of the second purchase agreement, and Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Addendum to this agreement, which, English Holdings argues, provided a choice to either terminate the purchase agreement in the event the tenants organized to purchase the property and request the return of his deposit, or purchase the property subject to “such exceptions.” We disagree.</p>

Such an interpretation would be contrary to the negotiated provisions in the agreement that English Holdings convey title to Mr. Psa-romatis, free of any claims by the tenants, Mr. Psaromatis’s objections to the exceptions in the title commitment regarding the tenants’ rights under TOPA, English Holdings’s promise to satisfy all of his objections, and Mr. Psaromatis’s continued and unwavering refusal to settle until the Tenants’ Association’s claims were resolved. Therefore, the trial court erred in concluding that Mr. Psaromatis was required to proceed to settlement before English Holdings could convey insurable title, free of any claims by the tenants, and that as a result, he was in default of the contract.

The trial court concluded that under Paragraph 14 of the second purchase agreement, Mr. Psaromatis’s contract deposit of $52,800 was declared forfeited and was to be paid to English Holdings as liquidated damages. Paragraph 14 provides that “the amount of Buyer’s Deposit ... is the parties’ reasonable estimate of Seller’s damages in the event of Buyer’s default, and that upon Buyer’s default in its purchase obligations ... <em>not caused by any breach by Seller, </em>Seller shall ... retain Buyer’s Deposit ... as liquidated damages (Emphasis added).

(I) in the event of a failure of any condition or contingency to Buyer to close on the purchase of the property, including without limitation, the failure of Seller to deliver title as required by paragraph 3 (which states English Holdings shall convey insurable title).” We agree with appellant and conclude that because English Holdings could not convey insurable title at the time it demanded that the parties settle, the trial court erred in concluding that Mr. Psaromatis’s deposit must be forfeited.</p>

In fact, in his April 23, 2003, title objection letter to English Holdings, Mr. Psaromatis flatly refused to proceed with the purchase of the property unless English Holdings “answered, cured, or resolved [his objections] in accordance with the [second purchase] Agreement.” Although English Holdings responded to Mr. Psaromatis’s objections by promising to satisfy <em>all </em>of his objections “prior to closing, or by affidavit at closing,” it failed to do so. It is uncontested that as of November 24, 2004, the date that English Holdings demanded that Mr. Psaromatis proceed with settlement, the tenants of the property were claiming that they had a right to purchase the property and that English Holdings failed to properly comply with TOPA. Although English Holdings contends that Mr. Psaro-matis never “asked” for the return of his <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>deposit, it is clear that he certainly never accepted the alternative — purchasing the property subject to the exceptions.</p>

The tenants’ claims of noncompliance with the TOPA notice requirements are explicitly listed in Paragraph 1 of the Addendum as a ground upon which a buyer [Mr. Psaromatis] may receive a full refund of his deposit.</p>

One such situation can be found in section 2 of this paragraph, which provides that the deposit <em>shall </em>be refundable “in the event of a failure of <em>any condition or contingency to Buyer to close on the purchase of the property, including without limitation, the failure of Seller to deliver title as required by paragraph 3 </em>[of the second purchase agreement].” (Emphasis added). This provision, by far, provides the strongest support for the return of Mr. Psaromatis’s deposit. We have concluded that the duty of English Holdings to convey insurable title was a “condition precedent” to Mr. Psaromatis’s duty to “close on the purchase of the property,” and that this condition was never satisfied. We have also concluded that the duty of English Holdings to convey title free of any claims by the tenants was a condition precedent to Mr. Psaromatis’s duty to “close on the purchase of the property,” and that this condition was also unsatisfied at the time English Holdings demanded settlement. The language in Paragraph 3 makes clear that when either of these two circumstances exists, the “Buyer’s Deposit shall be refundable” unconditionally.</p>
    <p id="b532-7" data-blocks='[["BL_532.7",532,[1020,863,756,1282]]]'>Fourth, the trial court relied on Paragraph 14 of the second purchase agreement in awarding Mr. Psaromatis’s deposit to English Holding as liquidated damages. Paragraph 14 provides: “the amount of Buyer’s Deposit hereunder ... is the parties’ reasonable estimate of Seller’s damages in the event of Buyer’s default, and that upon Buyer’s default in its purchase obligations ... <em>not caused by any breach by Seller, </em>Seller shall ... retain Buyer’s Deposit ... as liquidated damages....” (Emphasis added). Paragraph 14 makes clear that if the Seller is the “cause” of the Buyer’s breach of his purchase obligations under the contract, Seller may not retain Buyer’s deposit. Thus, because English Holdings failed to convey insurable title, free of any claims by the tenants, at the time designated for closing, English Holdings’s breach is indeed the reason why Mr. Psaromatis refused to close on the purchase of the property. As such, English Holdings is not entitled to retain his deposit.</p>

And the buyer is also entitled to cancel the purchase and receive a full refund of the deposit in the event that the seller fails to comply with the TOPA. We do not, however, understand the contract documents to limit the buyer to these remedies; an action for specific performance is not precluded. <em>See Tauber v. Quart, </em><a href="/a2d/938/0724-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="938 A.2d 724" data-case-ids="8318032" data-case-paths="/a2d/938/0724-01">938 A.2d 724</a>, 732 (D.C. 2007) (“When land is the subject matter of the agreement, the legal remedy is assumed to be inadequate, since each parcel of land is unique;” therefore, “it is routine for courts to enforce contracts to purchase real estate by ordering that they be specifically performed”) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, Mr. Psa-romatis’s action of holding out in the hope of receiving insurable title that was free of any claims by the tenants did not constitute a breach under the terms of the contract documents.</p>

Ample record evidence supports only one conclusion: whether the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>was lifted or remained in place, there were other impediments under English Holdings’s control — wholly unrelated to Mr. Psaromatis — that prevented English Holdings from conveying insurable and marketable title.

Under the title commitment of record, there are indeed "requirements” to be met, failing which no title insurance will be issued, and “exceptions,” which do not preclude issuance of title insurance, but are disclosed as clouds on the title which the title policy does not insure against. At issue here is Item 5 of the Schedule B, Section One, requirements, which requires proof of compliance with the TOPA, with respect to the tenants. Item 5 might be read to require no more than compliance with the seller’s obligation to proceed, in good faith, under the provisions of the TOPA, and not to go so far as to require that the tenants’ rights, if any, must be definitely resolved. Under this reading, it would seem clear on this record that the seller has satisfied Item 5 of the requirements — since it had proceeded under the TOPA — and the seller would therefore be able to convey insurable <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>title.

Co., supra, </em><a href="/a2d/874/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="874 A.2d 862" data-case-ids="8956643" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0862-01">874 A.2d at 871</a>, we are not persuaded by English Holdings’s argument.</p>

Despite counsel for English Holdings's assertion in a subsequent letter to counsel for Mr. Psaromatis that English Holdings’s own title insurance company, Land America Commonwealth, did not view the two defects as "defects that should block a closing,” a review of the record demonstrates that Land America Commonwealth predicated this statement upon its belief that it was no longer responsible for resolving the two title defects because the insurance policy Ms. Lloyd had purchased through it for the Subject Property had terminated.

English Holdings raised a counterclaim against Mr. Psaromatis, which alleged that the filing of the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>slandered the title. To establish a claim for slander-of-title, the plaintiff must prove that (1) the communication relating to the title was false and malicious; (2) damages resulted from the publication of the statements; and (3) if, special damages are sought, the underlying damages must be pled with specificity. <em>See Herzog v. Kronman, </em><a href="/citations/?q=65%20App.%20D.C.%20253" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="65 App. D.C. 253">65 App. D.C. 253</a>, 253, <a href="/f2d/82/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="82 F.2d 859" data-case-ids="934945" data-case-paths="/f2d/82/0859-01">82 F.2d 859</a>, 859 (1936); <em>M.A.P. v.

Here, English Holding's slander-of-title claim is without merit because, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>was neither false nor malicious. Mr. Psaromatis was within his right to file the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>to protect his interest in the Subject Property and Mr. Psaromatis’s decision to file the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>was made in good faith, which is supported by evidence in the record that he was willing to release the Notice of <em>Lis Pendens </em>in exchange for other adequate security assurance from English Holdings.</p>

Mr. Psaromatis argued in his Opposition to English Holdings’s Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees that the denial of English Holdings’s counterclaim should be accounted for in the trial court’s determination because English Holdings did not prevail in the <em>entire </em>litigation. The trial court agreed and determined that the reasonable counsel fees of $62,275 and costs of $4,823.56 were incurred by English Holdings in the litigation against Mr. Psaromatis, and that each figure should be reduced by one-third. The total amount of counsel fees awarded, including costs and expenses, was $46,734.71.</p>
