The four men got out of the cars, approached Irick and asked him if he knew anything abut the shooting on Franklin Way. Irick responded that he had heard something about the shooting and that he was on his way to meet someone at the Starlight building who knew what had happened and that the four men could come with him. Irick then got in the back of the Subaru.

Appellant then got out of the car and ordered Irick to also get out of the car. Irick resisted and begged Antoine Brown to help him. Rieara then came over and assured Irick that nothing was going to happen and he was just going to have to walk home.

Appellant argues that this murder was not drug-related, but rather, that he killed the victim because he believed that the victim had attempted to rob and shoot him earlier in the evening. While there was evidence of the retaliation motive appellant cites, this was not the entire story. The Commonwealth’s evidence demonstrated that the victim and his associates were “stick-up kids” who systematically robbed known drug dealers; that appellant and his co-conspirators knew this fact; that appellant and his co-conspirators were drug dealers; that the victim attempted to rob appellant earlier in the evening precisely because appellant and his co-conspirators were drug dealers; and that appellant murdered the victim in retaliation. Thus, the evidence of the drug-related activity, which was limited as to appellant’s specific prior bad acts, was properly admitted to show that this killing did not occur in a vacuum, <em>i.e. </em>to demonstrate motive. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Further, trial counsel reported to the trial judge that although DeJesus and Wilson were in the state prison system (albeit trial counsel could not locate which penitentiary DeJesus was in), trial counsel elected not to call them as witnesses because their testimony would have consisted of inadmissible double-hearsay. N.T. 3/23/00 at 735-39. Indeed, it appears that the only thing these “witnesses” would have testified to was in fact double-hearsay: <em>ie. </em>that Banks had told them that Murphy allegedly had told Banks that Murphy was involved in Arthur Irick’s murder. Notably, appellant failed to produce any of these witnesses at the evidentiary hearing and he does not now suggest that any of them would have provided other relevant and admissible testimony.

Thus, the Commonwealth argues that the references to appellant were isolated and not prejudicial and, thus, counsel was not ineffective. The trial court, in its opinion, deemed the references to appellant hailing from New York as not prejudicial. Trial counsel, at the remand hearing, echoed that he did not object because evidence of drug-activity on the part of appellant and his co-conspirators had been deemed admissible and he did not believe that the references to New York were prejudicial “in and of [themselves].”</p>

In this case, the drug motive was certainly relevant and the fact that appellant and his cohorts were from New York was, if not strictly relevant, not inherently prejudicial, either. To the extent that the prosecutor then generalized from the facts here to speak in his opening of an “onslaught,” however, there was certainly a basis for trial counsel to forward an objection. Whether an “onslaught” existed was not remotely at issue; nor was it relevant to attempt to tie appellant’s alleged conduct into some broader social problem involving outsiders coming into the county.

While the prosecutor here did not specifically implore the jury to “send a message” with a verdict of death, his comments regarding appellant and his co-conspirators bringing violence and drugs from New York to York County nevertheless trigger similar concerns about appealing to irrelevant factors.

Although counsel certainly could have forwarded an objection to the remarks, we do not believe that, as a matter of strategy, he was constitutionally obliged to do so. The fact of the matter is that both appellant and the victim were involved in aspects of the drug trade; the task for the jury was to determine appellant’s responsibility, if any, for the killing. Viewed in this light, it was not unreasonable for counsel to view the reference in the prosecutor’s opening as insufficiently harmful to warrant an objection and the inevitable highlighting of the remark which an objection would have created.

In finding that counsel was not ineffective the remand court noted that it had conducted a colloquy with appellant at appellant’s sentencing at which appellant stated that he had made an informed decision not to testify at the penalty phase, and that there was nothing that he wanted his lawyer to do that counsel failed to pursue.

The fact that the jury rejected certain proffered mitigators — mitigators supported by a brief argument — does not mean that a full preparation of other relevant mitigation evidence might not have changed the result. Moreover, it is not self-evident that the proffered mitigators are objectively “stronger” than evidence of appellant’s background. Counsel’s duty encompasses pursuit of all statutory mitigators of which he is aware or reasonably should be aware, unless there is some objective, reasonable ground not to pursue the circumstance (such as when it might open the door to harmful evidence). Finally, we note that this was a close case in terms of the penalty. The Commonwealth proved a single aggravating circumstance. Counsel’s task (at that phase) was to attempt to convince at least one member of the jury that there was at least one mitigating circumstance which should be accepted and weighed against the aggravator. We cannot simply assume, as the Commonwealth would have us do, that all of the jurors would have rejected any proffered mitigator merely because they rejected other mitigators which were very briefly argued.</p>

The fact that appellant was satisfied with his counsel at the sentencing hearing colloquy in no way proves that trial counsel’s investigation and performance satisfied Sixth Amendment standards. Appellant is not a lawyer, nor was he in a position to know whether his counsel had performed competently. The measure of effectiveness is not whether one’s client appeared satisfied at the time. A client is entitled to trust in the fact that his attorney will know what investigation to undertake, what leads to pursue, and what evidence to look for. It is one thing for a client to fail to cooperate when asked pertinent questions.

Nevertheless, we have little difficulty concluding that appellant has proved the performance prong of <em>Strickland </em>(arguable merit and lack of reasonable basis in Pennsylvania parlance). We recognize that the evidence presented by appellant at the evidentiary hearing was not so strong as the foregone “smoking gun” mitigation evidence at issue in <em>Williams </em>and, to a lesser extent, <em>Wiggins. </em>Nevertheless, appellant did prove that there were certain factors in his background which were easily discoverable and which could have been forwarded in mitigation had counsel undertaken even a minimal investigation.

In assessing prejudice, that single aggravating circumstance must be contrasted with the two mitigating circumstances actually presented as well as the mitigating circumstance that counsel should have pursued — that appellant had been abandoned by his mother at a young age, abused by his mother’s boyfriend at the age of 10, that his mother and father had a substance abuse problem and that he was institutionalized from the age of 12 until he was 15. Although we recognize that the unpursued evidence in this case is not the strongest, we further note that trial counsel’s presentation at the penalty phase included no affirmative evidence at all, but only a brief argument and a stipulation. Such a performance, which was not motivated by any strategic decision, left the jury with a dry assessment of appellant’s individual circumstances. In short, it is not just the failure to present evidence of appellant’s background which concerns us, but the fact that the failure occurred in a case where there was little effort to personalize appellant for the jury. Indeed, personalizing appellant’s background may have made one or more of the jurors more likely to accept the other mitigating circumstances which were pursued. We are satisfied that it is probable that at least one juror would have accepted at least one mitigating circumstance and found that it outweighed the Commonwealth’s single aggravating circumstance. Thus, had the jury heard testimony and been able to consider all of the mitigation evidence and argument together, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance and voted not to impose the death penalty. <em>See, e.g., Wiggins, </em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="187" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">539 U.S. at 536-37</a>, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="188" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">123 S.Ct. 2527</a>, 2543, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="189" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">156 L.Ed.2d 471</a>. Accordingly, we agree with appellant that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. As a result, appellant’s death sentence is vacated and we remand this matter to the trial court for a new penalty hearing.</p>
