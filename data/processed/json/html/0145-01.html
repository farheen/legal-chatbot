Drayton’s conviction was based almost exclusively on the testimony of two police officers as to the out-of-court statements of D.D. and an unidentified witness. Drayton filed a timely appeal.

When he arrived at the scene approximately three minutes later, Officer McCollum saw Drayton, who matched the dispatcher’s reported description of a “black female, red and black hair, black jeans, woman with a knife.” Officer McCollum told Drayton to drop the knife and approach him, and she complied. McCollum testified that Drayton was “irate,” “flapping her arms, talking real loud profanely,” and that he smelled alcohol on her breath. At that point, Officer McCollum placed her in handcuffs and put her in his patrol car. After conversing with Drayton regarding what had occurred, Officer McCollum crossed the street to speak with some of the bystanders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Officer Williams described Drayton as “belligerent” and “[i]ntoxicated, very irate, cussing, upset, going off.” Officer McCollum testified that Officer Williams arrived around the time that Officer McCollum was placing Drayton in the patrol car, and Officer Williams stated, “[W]e were trying to find out what was going on. It was kind of chaotic at the time.... Basically, I talked to witnesses to find out what was going on.” Several unidentified witnesses then called to Officer Williams, yelling, “There she is. You need to get her,” and “She had a knife. She’s the one right there.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Officer Williams was allowed to testify, over defense’s objection, that he then spoke with an unidentified female witness, and that the witness told him that Drayton “pulled a knife on her little boy, you need to get her.” The witness was never identified nor called to testify, and the officer’s testimony was admitted under the “excited utterance” exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

D.D. was “crying, very upset, very emotional, in a daze, stuttering.” Officer McCollum testified that D.D. told him that D.D. and his mother “had got into an argument over some money he was supposed to have gave to her. Apparently he didn’t give it to her and they got into an argument and she punched him in the face, and somehow they got into a scuffle. At that time, she produced a knife and stated ‘I’m going to stab you motherfucker if you don’t give me my motherfucking money.’ ” Officer McCollum testified that D.D. stated that “his mother had pulled a knife on him, and wanted him to give her some money, and thought that he had had some money of hers.” Both statements were admitted, over defense counsel’s objections, as excited utterances.</p>

The statement was witnessed by Ames while Drayton sat just outside the room where the statement was given. Ames testified that D.D. wrote in the statement that he had lied to the police on the day in question because he was angry with his mother for refusing to take him shopping for <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>clothing. According to D.D.’s statement, Drayton never pulled out a knife or threatened D.D. with a knife.</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[190,447,755,1497]]]'>Drayton testified that D.D. was angry with her because she would not take him shopping for clothes. She explained that she had a few drinks with her lunch, and that she had eaten an apple, which was why she was carrying a knife at the time of the incident. According to Drayton, she and D.D. had a minor physical altercation, during which she removed the knife from her pocket after it cut her through her jeans, throwing the knife to the ground. She denied ever brandishing the knife, or threatening her son with it. The trial court found Officers McCollum and Williams to be credible, basing its verdict entirely on their testimony regarding D.D.’s out-of-court statements. The trial court specifically discredited Drayton’s testimony and D.D.’s written statement, noting that Drayton was in the next room when the statement was taken, and that the statement “tracks the testimony” of Drayton. The trial court subsequently found Drayton guilty of simple assault and attempted possession of a prohibited weapon, sentencing her to 120 days’ incarceration on each count, to be served concurrently, and two years’ probation. This appeal followed.</p>

      <em>Standi </em>also addressed the definition of “police interrogation” under <em>Crawford, </em>specifically as it applies to “testimonial” statements. Noting that the term “police interrogation” is used throughout the <em>Crawford </em>opinion without indicating that it requires anything more than “questioning in a structured environment,” we held that “[n]either additional ‘formality’ nor an ‘adversarial setting,’ however slight, is required” to define “police interrogation.” <em><a href="/a2d/866/0799-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="866 A.2d 799" data-case-ids="9038674" data-case-paths="/a2d/866/0799-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/866/0799-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="866 A.2d 799" data-case-ids="9038674" data-case-paths="/a2d/866/0799-01">at 811-12</a>.

Therefore, D.D.’s statements were “testimonial” under <em>Crawford, </em>and, since D.D. was not available for cross-examination, their admission was plainly erroneous. <em>Johnson, supra, </em><a href="/us/520/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="520 U.S. 461" data-case-ids="11652245" data-case-paths="/us/520/0461-01">520 U.S. at 466-67</a>, <a href="/us/520/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="520 U.S. 461" data-case-ids="11652245" data-case-paths="/us/520/0461-01">117 S.Ct. 1544</a>.
