We find that the need to identify an unconscious victim, in order to facilitate investigation of the attack, can be an exigent circumstance justifying a warrantless search of the victim’s clothing. We specifically hold that the instant, warrantless search was justified when the police had no reason to believe that Appellee had committed a crime. As a result, we conclude that the suppression court erred as a matter of law in relying on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania’s decisions in <em>Commonwealth v.

The shooting victim, Ap-pellee, was already en route to Temple University Hospital.

The nurses asked the police officers if they knew the victim’s identity, which they did not. <em>Id. </em>Another officer testified that they decided to go through Appellee’s clothing in an attempt to identify him. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Police retrieved what initially appeared to be a wallet from the front pocket of Appel-lee’s pants. <em>Id. </em>However, the item turned out to be a large, clear, plastic bag containing three small, plastic bags with a white, chunky substance believed to be crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 7. A further search of Appel-lee’s clothes revealed a large bottle containing an orange liquid, a small bottle with one orange substance, and a small prescription bottle of Xanex with an address that was different from Appellee’s. Police also recovered $302 in cash. Ultimately, Appellee’s identification was found in his back pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.

In <em>Silo I, </em>when the police searched Silo’s clothing in the hospital, he was a suspect in the death of his mother. In the case at bar, the uncontradicted evidence indicates the police did not suspect Appellee had perpetrated any crime; on the contrary, Appellee was the victim of the reported shooting under investigation. Thus, the officers merely were attempting to ascertain the identity of the John Doe by the only immediate means possible, since Ap-pellee was unconscious with a gunshot wound to his mouth. It was only while attempting to identify Appellee, the victim <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>of a crime, that they found evidence of another crime.

The Commonwealth argues that the need to identify the victim is an exigent circumstance justifying the warrantless search. The Commonwealth contends that the officers were duty-bound to attempt to ascertain the identity of the John Doe. The Commonwealth claims that since the officer observed the contraband while performing his lawful duties, he was permitted to seize the contraband, rendering it admissible as evidence. Because Appellee was receiving medical care when his clothing was searched, it is undisputed the search cannot be justified as a medical emergency. Rather, the Commonwealth asserts the search was not investigative in nature, but performed solely to ascertain Appellee’s identity. We agree.</p>
