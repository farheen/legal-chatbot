    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[149,742,756,1497]]]'>The Association was unhappy with Article 38, Section 21 of the 2001 CBA, arguing that it gave the Commonwealth unfettered discretion to decide whether to provide employees with legal representation and indemnification, making the benefit almost illusory. The Association presented evidence that in 2002 over 1,500 lawsuits were filed against employees in the bargaining unit. Some of these suits included criminal charges that were dismissed; however, the requests for reimbursement of legal fees were denied by the Commonwealth because the 2001 CBA required acquittal after a full jury trial. The Association also presented two examples where two bargaining unit members each spent over $25,000 to defend civil complaints filed by inmates that were eventually settled or dismissed without trial. However, the employees were not reimbursed for their attorney fees. The Association proposed changes to Article 33, Section 21 of the 2001 CBA that would require the Commonwealth to provide legal representation to employees in any civil or criminal case, regardless of whether the conduct in the workplace was alleged to be malicious or negligent.</p>
    <p id="b411-8" data-blocks='[["BL_411.9",411,[950,260,755,1285]]]'>The Commonwealth opposed the Association’s proposed changes. The Chief Counsel for the Department of Corrections testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that the proposed changes were contrary to the regulations of the Executive Board, the agency responsible for determining when a Commonwealth employee’s expenses can be reimbursed. The Chief Counsel explained that “4 PA Code Section 39.1 simply prohibits Commonwealth lawyers from representing employees in criminal matters.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.) 6/14/05, at 7; R.R. 446a. This prohibition aims to avoid the conflict of interest presented by the Commonwealth prosecuting a defendant of alleged crimes and, at the same time, defending against those charges. Nevertheless, where a prosecution is found to be unfounded, the Commonwealth will pay the legal fees of a private attorney. The Chief Counsel testified that it was rare that a Commonwealth employee was not reimbursed for his legal expenses under 4 Pa.Code § 39.1.</p>

These were the only two cases where, in the Chief Counsel’s experience over the last seven years, attorney fees were denied. In the first case, the General Counsel disapproved Corrections Officer Kenneth Klaus’ request for reimbursement because the Commonwealth had a videotape of Klaus <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>striking an inmate in the face with his knee during a strip search.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the second case, involving an inmate’s allegations of sexual harassment against, <em>inter alia, </em>Corrections Officer Carlos Riera, the General Counsel disapproved Riera’s counsel fees because they were excessive. The Chief Counsel refuted the Association’s argument that Chapter 39 gave unfettered discretion to the Commonwealth. He explained that the General Counsel’s denial of indemnification and reimbursement for legal representation can be appealed to an administrative hearing. Thereafter, it is renewable by the Commonwealth Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The Commonwealth raised the issue in its post-hearing brief and stated again that Chapter 39 “prohibited” it from representing employees in criminal matters. R.R. 813a-814a. These arguments were made to advance the claim the Panel lacked authority to issue an award that would compel the Commonwealth to violate the law. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the Commonwealth’s appointed arbitrator dissented from Paragraph 18 of the award as being, <em>inter alia, </em>“contrary to law.” In sum, the issue of the Panel’s authority was raised, not waived, by the Commonwealth.</p>

The previous CBA had provided that the “Employer [Commonwealth] shall provide liability coverage and legal defense in civil suits as detailed in Title 4 PA Code Chapter 39 [Defense of Suits Against Commonwealth Employees] and Management Directives 205.6 and 630.2.” (Reproduced Record at 59a.) As for criminal cases, the Commonwealth was permitted under the CBA to provide an employee with counsel; if-it did not, then it was required to provide reasonable attorneys’ fees to be recovered later from the employee’s retirement account if the defense was ultimately un<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>successful.

The Association argued that Article 33, Section 21 of the previous CBA provided the Commonwealth with unfettered discretion in determining whether to provide employees with a contractual benefit. It presented evidence that in 2002, over 1,500 lawsuits were filed, including suits involving criminal charges that were dismissed as frivolous. It stated that requests for reimbursement of legal fees were routinely denied by the Commonwealth because the CBA required acquittal after a jury trial. The Association proposed changes to Article 33, Section 21 that would mandate the Commonwealth to provide legal representation to employees named in a civil complaint or reimburse counsel fees in defense of a criminal complaint when arising out of the job duties, as well as payment of civil judgments. The Commonwealth opposed the changes, stating that 4 Pa.Code § 39.1, adopted by the Executive Board,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> prohibited Commonwealth lawyers from representing employees in criminal matters.

Because exclusive authority is vested in the Executive Board, it holds that a “legislative enactment” would be needed to amend those two provisions of the Administrative Code to make expenses subject of bargaining.

The majority then goes on to state that because “expenses” are not “compensation,” they are not negotiable, can be reimbursed solely as determined by a public employer, and are not subject to collective bargaining.

What this ignores is that most public officials, including judges, are routinely sued for actions they undertake as part of carrying out their responsibilities — it comes with the job — it is a condition of employment.

By holding that counsel fees are not terms of employment, the majority removes them a subject from bargaining, meaning similar provisions contained in collective bargaining agreements throughout this Commonwealth are now illegal. Moreover, because a police officer or corrections officer’s defense is not subject to bargaining, under the majority’s reasoning, whether a corrections or police officer’s counsel fees are paid is now at the sufferance of the public employer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_11" id="ref_footnote_2_11">11</a>

The majority posits that the dissent is raising a "brand new issue” because the dissent relies on Section 805 of Act 195 for its position that the Commonwealth is required to carry out an award unless it requires a "legislative enactment.” I am a bit non plussed by that position, considering that the majority states the "Commonwealth’s issue on appeal [is] whether the [arbitration] award requires the Commonwealth to perform acts prohibited by law.” If the Commonwealth is required by Section 805 to implement any award not requiring a legislative enactment, this is not a "brand new issue,” but a direct answer to the issue raised. The majority, I respectfully suggest, is confusing what is an issue and what is a rationale.</p>

Such an interpretation would nullify, for all practical purposes, the "final and binding” provisions of section 805 for all awards regarding salaries or other compensation.</blockquote>

To mask that it is making the reimbursement of legal fees and other expenses totally at the sufferance of the Executive Board subjecting corrections officers and state troopers to financial ruin for meritless charges brought by criminals, the majority cites egregious examples for which the Employer would be responsible for counsel fees and payment of judgments. I agree with the majority that it would be unfortunate if the Commonwealth would have to pay fees in those circumstances. Much like we toss out coerced confessions that limit the ability to convict individuals to further the overriding good that the Constitution should be followed, the Commonwealth may have to pay those fees so that corrections officers and state troopers know that they can carry out their duties assured that their families will not be financially ruined by having to pay counsel fees.</p>
