The Plaintiff, who has the record title to three of the lots of land except for the effect of these tax liens, brings these two real actions to recover the property. The Plaintiff’s only title to the fourth lot, the Philip Winslow lot, had been acquired by virtue of a quitclaim deed, dated April 28, 1964, from the Town of Poland, similar to those given by the Town to the Defendants’ predecessors in title to the four lots.

One Selectman agreed that “technically” the Town Manager wasn’t “appointed” but it was “the understanding” that he should also serve in that capacity. Near the close of the trial after a great deal of evidence had been presented as to the informal manner in which the Tax Collector was appointed, the Justice inquired if the manner of the Town Manager’s appointment could not be stipulated and Defendants-Appellants’ counsel replied, “I can stipulate that the only provisions made are as brought out in the direct testimony and contained in the minutes.” From the abundance of direct testimony as to the manner in which the appointment <em>was </em>made and from the minutes an inference could properly be drawn that it was <em>not </em>made in writing.
