While admitting the representation of at least five such families in Delaware due process hearings, Appellants denied that their activities, even if amounting to the practice of law, constitute the <em>unauthorized </em>practice of law. They argued that section 1415(h)(1) of the IDEA permits the representations in which they have engaged and preempts any state-law proscription against the unauthorized practice of law that might otherwise apply. That section provides that any party to a due process hearing “shall be accorded .... the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities.” They also claimed that Delaware is alone among the fifty states in precluding non-lawyer representation in these circumstances.</p>

    <p id="b904-6" data-blocks='[["BL_904.6",904,[204,1608,755,631]]]'>Appellants’ principal argument is that the IDEA guarantees parents the right to have trained non-lawyers advocate on their behalf in due process hearings. They contend that the IDEA could hardly be clearer because it draws no distinction between counsel and “individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities.” Tó the extent that Delaware law conflicts with federal law, the argument runs, Delaware law is displaced and federal law governs.</p>

We do not share the parties’ vision of clarity. In our view, section 1415(h)(1) is ambiguous to the extent it appears to confer joint authority on lawyers and non-lawyers to accompany and advise parents and others affected by the operation of the due process hearings provided under the IDEA. That being said, however, case law as well as statutory history support the ODC’s interpretation.</p>

In that case, Appellant Arons sought an award of fees for her successful representation of parents in a due process hearing in New Jersey, where state law allows non-lawyers to represent parents in due process hearings. In affirming a decision of the United States District Court for New Jersey that held that the New Jersey regulation authorizing such fees permitted, payment of only legal fees and not those of lay advocates, the court of appeals rejected the statutory intent argument advanced by Appellants here.

Although the [IDEA] does give “[a]ny party to any hearing” the right to “present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses,” those functions are not designated to be performed by lay advocates. Furthermore, the statute does not use the word “represent” in subsection (d)(1), as would be expected if Congress intended to place expert and legal counsel on the same footing.</blockquote>

The Conference Report states that in administrative due process hearings a party is entitled to “the right to counsel and to be advised and accompanied by individuals with special knowledge, training or skills with respect to the problems of handicapped children.” S.Conf.Rep. No. 94-455, 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 27, 49 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1480, 1503. Senator Williams, in providing a detailed analysis of the legislation before the Senate on November 19, 1975, echoed those words verbatim. <em>See </em>121 Cong.Rec. 37416. This language confirms the clear distinction that Congress envisioned between the representational role of counsel and the advisory role of non-lawyers.</p>

Pursuant to these amendments, one of the safeguards required for agencies receiving federal funds under the IDEA is the adoption of procedures by the agency “that require the parent of a child with a disability, <em>or the attorney representing the child, </em>to provide notice” to the state or local educational agency of certain information in connection with a complaint. <a href="/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="20 U.S.C. § 1415">20 U.S.C. § 1415</a>(b)(6) and (7) (emphasis added). The word “attorney” is an indisputable reference to a member of the Bar and not a layperson, even if that layperson possesses “special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities.” Equally supportive of the ODC’s position is the fact that while the IDEA has been amended several times since <em>Arons </em>was decided, Congress has not attempted to overrule that judicial interpretation.</p>

Congress obviously knows how to provide such authority when it wishes to do so.

That letter was written in response to a request by the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Washington for a “legal analysis regarding the role of lay advocates in educational agency administrative hearings” conducted under the IDEA. The superintendent suggested that the IDEA’S language indicates that non-lawyers are not in fact authorized to engage in activities conventionally viewed as legal representation, such as examining and cross-examining witnesses. In its response, the Department of Education rejected the superintendent’s reading of the IDEA, concluding that notwithstanding the Senate Conference Report and the absence in section 1415(h)(1) of the term “represent,” lay advocates are permitted to represent parties at due process hearings and appeals under the IDEA.</p>

First, it reasoned that because no “bifurcation of function” is set forth in the statute between counsel on the one hand and individuals with special knowledge or training on the other, the permissible roles of the two must be the same. Second, the Department looked to the remarks of Congressman George Miller and Senator Alan Cranston, both of California. Congressman Miller, a member of the Subcommittee on Select Education which prepared the House bill, explained section 1415(h)(1) to his colleagues by observing that parents “will have the right to be accompanied by counsel or other qualified individuals who possess ‘special knowledge or training with respect to the education of handicapped children.’” 121 Cong.Rec. 25539 (1975). Senator Cranston noted that the “procedural requirements [of the IDEA] are consistent with the existing California statutory and master plan requirements on this subject,” which, at the time, permitted the lay representation of parties in California due process hearings. 121 Cong.Rec. 37419 (1975).

First, in concluding that the permissible roles of counsel and individuals <a id="p873" href="#p873" data-label="873" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*873</a>with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities must be the same, the Department overlooked the inherent and presumptive representational authority with which counsel are cloaked and non-lawyers are not.

Such an approach renders that aspect of the Department’s analysis questionable. <em>See generally Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em><a href="/us/447/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="447 U.S. 102" data-case-ids="6181683" data-case-paths="/us/447/0102-01">447 U.S. 102</a>, 118, <a href="/us/447/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="447 U.S. 102" data-case-ids="6181683" data-case-paths="/us/447/0102-01">100 S.Ct. 2051</a>, <a href="/us/447/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="447 U.S. 102" data-case-ids="6181683" data-case-paths="/us/447/0102-01">64 L.Ed.2d 766</a> (1980) (“[C]ontemporaneous remarks of a single legislator who sponsors a bill are not controlling in analyzing legislative history.”). Finally, the Department’s reliance upon the fact that lay representation had been authorized by Congress for certain other types of administrative proceedings is puzzling because, as previously noted, that factor actually supports the opposite conclusion — that Congress knew how to authorize lay representation when it wished to do so.</p>

It also concedes that some parents will forego their statutory right to contest changes to their child’s education plan because they cannot afford legal counsel and will opt not to proceed <em>pro se </em>due to the complexity of the hearings and the prospect of facing two sets of government lawyers. The ODC submits, however, that Appellants “grossly and unfairly” exaggerate the risk that Delaware will deprive children of that interest unless the children and their parents are allowed to be represented by lay advocates. In this regard, the ODC notes that Delaware’s Community Legal Aid Society has, on occasion, provided representation at IDEA due process hearings to parents and children whose cases satisfy the organization’s case acceptance criteria. The ODC further contends that the State of Delaware has a compelling interest in regulating the practice of law within its boundaries, and that this interest significantly outweighs any potential benefit that some individual parents and children may obtain through the services of lay advocates.</p>

      <a id="p874" href="#p874" data-label="874" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*874</a>We agree. A balancing of the <em>Mathews </em>factors suggests that procedural due process would not be violated by forbidding parents from having non-lawyer representation in hearings under the IDEA. While there is no question of the importance of the individual interests involved, it seems clear that parties to an IDEA hearing are already provided with substantial procedural safeguards. The hearings are conducted in a manner typical of contested, adversarial adjudicatory hearings, including the direct and cross-examination of witnesses and the required exchange of witness lists and documents in advance of the hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> While we recognize that Appellants possess some expertise in the area of the educational needs of disabled children, they admittedly lack the training and skills that lawyers are expected to exhibit in matters of evidence and procedure. Second, it seems logical that the third <em>Mathews </em>factor, <em>ie., </em>“governmental interest in fiscal and administrative efficiency,” would encompass this State’s exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law. It would also implicate the ODC’s argument that lay advocates are unregulated and, unlike members of the Bar, are not answerable to the disciplinary process that operates as an arm of this Court. This Court does not exercise its inherent authority to regulate the practice of law for the purpose of protecting the financial interests of the lawyer. Our role is to insure that the public will enjoy the representation of individuals who have been found to possess the necessary skills and training to represent others.</p>

But the record also reflects that Delaware’s Community Legal Aid Society has in the past provided representation at IDEA due process hearings to parents and children whose cases satisfy the organization’s case acceptance criteria. The record further reflects that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the district involved are required to provide information to parents regarding the availability of free or low-cost legal services which may be available. If it could be demonstrated that an unmet need exists and that the local bar could not adequately respond, this Court would consider the adoption of a rule allowing lay representation in a certain limited class of cases. <em>See, e.g., </em>Supr. Ct.R. 57 (permitting civil actions before Justice of the Peace Courts in which an artificial entity or public body is a party to be prosecuted and/or defended by an officer or employee of that artificial entity or public body, who need not be an attorney duly licensed to practice law in this State).

This Court has some difficulty understanding the applicability of this argument to the matter at hand. It is not alleged that forbidding parents from having non-lawyer assistance in hearings under the IDEA will deprive the Appellants of their due process rights, nor are the parents, whose rights are purportedly abridged, parties to this action. Appellants appear to be acting as surrogates in pressing the due process claim.
