Black’s Law Dictionary defines “enforce” as “to put into execution; to cause to take effect; to make effective; as, to enforce a writ, a judgment, or the collection of a debt or fine; to compel obedience to.” “Enforcement”, then, clearly refers to the several courses of action — such as acceleration and foreclosure — open to the payee of the note to compel the maker to fulfill his obligations under the note. The course of action pursued by appellee in the tax lien suit was at best a defense of the priority of its lien, not an enforcement of the lien itself. Thus, the legal fees incurred by appellee in the tax lien suit do not represent costs of enforcement of the note but rather represent the cost of maintaining the status quo.</p>

It could have, for example, demanded that appellants discharge the tax lien, and upon their failure to do so, appellee could have, itself, discharged the lien and <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>added the amount to the balance of appellants’ debt. Alternatively, appellee could have, perhaps, declared appellants to be in default in the performance of a covenant or undertaking under the deed of trust and demanded payment of the balance of the principal sum preparatory to calling upon the trustees to foreclose. Either of these actions would have amounted to enforcement of the note entitling appellee or the trustees to collect from appellants reasonable attorney’s fees. Appellee, however, chose to rely on the priority of its lien, which, of course, the parties by their stipulation recognized at the outset. The conclusion is therefore compelled that the attorney’s fee incurred by appellee in the tax lien litigation were not chargeable to the appellants under the terms of either the note or the deed of trust which secured it.</p>
