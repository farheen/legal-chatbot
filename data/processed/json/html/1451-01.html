On the death of either spouse the entire estate goes to the survivor, it can not ordinarily be partitionéd during their joint lives, it cannot be severed by the act of either, but it may be sold or mortgaged by properly executed instrument joined in by both husband and wife; the wife’s contract alone to pledge it being utterly worthless.
