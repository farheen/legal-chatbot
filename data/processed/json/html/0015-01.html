Claimant contends that the focus of the inquiry should not be on the difference between pre-injury and post-injury earnings, but rather pre-injury earnings and post-injury earning power. Claimant advocates that the Board should have applied a test that reflects the fact that, but for his work-related injury, he would have had concurrent employment. Claimant indicates that he had no power over the circumstances that prevented him from beginning to work for Leonard in July 2004. Rather, Claimant argues that the Board should not have penalized him for a delay in the commencement of his new position over which he had no control.</p>

As suggested above, Claimant argues that the Board erroneously recognized the communications between himself and Leonard to have resulted in Leonard offering him a job, rather than in him accepting the offer, thereby improperly substituting its judgment for that of the WCJ. The Board stated that “contract negotiations beyond Claimant’s control prevented Leonard from employing him on his intended July 25, 2004 start date.” (Board Opinion, p. 5).</p>
    <p id="b48-9" data-blocks='[["BL_48.9",48,[991,407,753,1127]]]'>Thus, the thrust of Claimant’s argument is that the relationship between himself and Leonard actually constituted an employment relationship at the time Claimant accepted the offer and that the date employment was to have begun was October 13, 2004, the date upon which Leonard requested that Claimant report for work. Claimant asserts that the Board erred in this respect, because it characterized Claimant’s decision to terminate his employment with Am Gard as a risk he himself assumed. We believe that the Board’s decision simply reflects its belief that neither offers nor acceptance of employment are key, but rather that the initiation of actual work for an employer is essential in order for a claimant’s status to constitute concurrent employment. With this potentially significant distinction in mind, we will proceed to address Claimant’s primary argument.</p>

The claimant in that case had worked full-time for R &amp; J Industries (R <em>&amp; </em>J) and several years later obtained part-time employment (twenty-five to forty hours per week) with Triangle Building Center (Triangle).

While Triangle initially agreed to that request, approximately two years later, Triangle filed a petition to review compensation benefits asserting that it had mistakenly agreed to include the claimant’s earnings from R &amp; J, based upon the fact that, at the time of the claimant’s original work injury, he had not actually been working for R &amp; J because of the temporary lay-off.</p>

There is no dispute that, if Claimant had not terminated his employment with Am Gard before he became disabled because of the surgery performed to correct his work-related injury, his average weekly wage calculation would have included those wages. The Board opined that, because his separation from Am Gard was not caused by his work injury, but rather because of his interest in obtaining a different, higher-paying position, Claimant is not entitled to have those former wages included in his average weekly wage calculation.</p>

Claimant also argues that this case is not similar to cases in which a claimant who is in a modified status resigns and consequently experiences a loss of earnings for reasons unrelated to a work injury, i.e., personal reasons. Rather, Claimant asserts, notwithstanding Leonard’s inability to have him begin work on the initial start date, his work injury is the only reason he did not have two jobs following the surgery for that injury.</p>

After returning to his pre-injury status, the claimant apparently was unable to fulfill his full responsibilities in that position. The claimant voluntarily left his employment and accepted a different, less stressful, but more highly compensated position with another employer.

We held in that case that the claimant’s decision to resign, not his original work injury, was the cause of his loss in wages, and thereby concluded that the claimant was not entitled to a reinstatement of his benefits. However, in <em>Home, </em>we hastened to point out that <em>Welsh </em>does not stand for the proposition that such a claimant could never seek reinstatement of benefits. Instead, a claimant needs only to satisfy the traditional burden associated with a reinstatement petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> (In <em>Welsh, </em>the Court noted that the claimant had not contacted his original employer to see if he could return to his modified position.)</p>

Hence, we remanded the case solely for the purpose of recalculation of wages for a discrete four-month period after the claimant obtained a treatment to correct problems associated with his work injury. With regard to the period following that treatment, we concluded that our holding in <em>Welsh </em>controlled and that benefits were precluded as any loss of earnings experienced by the claimant was the result of his voluntary decision to leave his prior employment.</p>
    <p id="b51-9" data-blocks='[["BL_51.9",51,[917,581,751,508]]]'>In the present case, as Employer properly notes, when Claimant resigned his position with Am Gard, that position no longer provided him with concurrent wages. The employment Leonard offered, which was the reason Claimant terminated his employment with Am Gard, did not occur before or at the time Claimant injured his foot. Hence, the Court cannot regard Leonard as a concurrent employer.</p>
    <p id="b51-10" data-blocks='[["BL_51.10",51,[917,1121,753,1234]]]'>Further, with regard to Claimant’s argument that the Board erred by essentially re-characterizing the nature of his work relationship with Leonard, we note that, unlike the facts in <em>Triangle, </em>Claimant established no work history that would substantiate his claim that he had concurrent employment with Leonard. In other words, whether Leonard did actually take the step of hiring Claimant or simply offered him a job, there is no basis upon which to conclude that this opportunity would provide a continuum of employment, such as that which Claimant had with Am Gard, sufficient to support a conclusion that the work and wages there could simply be substituted for the work history Claimant had at Am Gard. In fact, the circumstances relating to the contract dispute that delayed the start of his employment suggest that the consistency of employment Claimant experienced with Am Gard might be different from that which he might experience with Leonard.</p>

This Court relied on such factors in order to determine whether an employment relationship was on-going such that it supported a conclusion that an employee’s past earnings are sufficiently demonstrative of a pre-injury ability to earn wages from the allegedly concurrent employer.</p>
    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[195,1080,751,607]]]'>While the reality of Claimant’s consistent pre-injury concurrent employment is obvious, he terminated his position with that concurrent employer for reasons unrelated to his injury.

Although WCJ Torrey acknowledged that Employer had technically violated the Act by omitting Claimant’s time-of-injury concurrent employment, he also concluded that the omission was not significant in light of the fact that Claimant had no right to concurrent employment benefits. A WCJ considering a claim for penalties has sole discretion in deciding whether or not to award penalties for a violation of the Act. <em>See City of Philadelphia v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Andrews), </em><a href="/a2d/948/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="948 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="8243748" data-case-paths="/a2d/948/0221-01">948 A.2d 221</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). While Claimant argues that WCJ Vallely did not abuse her discretion in awarding penalties, our focus must remain on whether the Board erred in remanding her award for reconsideration in light of the Board’s March 22, 2007, decision on the merits and whether WCJ Torrey subsequently erred in declining to award penalties.</p>
    <p id="b52-7" data-blocks='[["BL_52.7",52,[994,619,752,757]]]'>We see no error in the Board’s decision to remand for reconsideration of the penalty issue. Because the Board reversed WCJ Vallely’s decision on the merits, and, consequently, concluded that Claimant was not entitled to the inclusion of concurrent wages in calculating his average weekly wage, the Board reasonably remanded the issue. As to WCJ Torrey’s decision not to award any penalty, we reiterate the notion that he had complete discretion to decide whether or not to award a penalty. <em>Andrews. </em>Claimant has not explained how WCJ Torrey’s decision in any way constitutes an abuse of that discretion.</p>
