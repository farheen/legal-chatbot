Since the prospect of an appeal and concomitant delay attends virtually every legal ruling made by a trial judge, it is capricious, at best, to grant a meritless motion merely to forestall the disgruntled party’s appeal. This case proves the point: the recusal order entered by the PCRA court led the Commonwealth to seek appellate review of the order, and the PCRA court certified that interlocutory appeal, thereby incurring the very delay President Judge Eby sought to prevent. Moreover, it is particularly capricious to invoke a concern with appellate delay as a reason to grant a meritless recusal motion. The denial of a recusal motion is not appealable as of right; thus, delay is not, in fact, inevitable even if the aggrieved party seeks to “pursue review.” Rather, delay will occur only if discretionary review is granted by an appellate court and a stay is issued.</p>

But, in analyzing that discretionary decision, I would be careful to distinguish between grants of recusal which are based upon the judge’s assessment of his ability to preside impartially (or the appearance of that prospect) and decisions — such as that at issue here— where the recusal was based upon some potential collateral consequence having nothing whatsoever to do with the jurist’s assessment of his impartiality. Review of a recusal based upon the judge’s determination that he is unable to preside fairly and impartially over a matter, or that ap<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>pearances are such that his impartiality may fairly be questioned, properly is deferential, since the jurist at issue is in the best position to assess the effect of the alleged disqualifying faetor(s). Indeed, in many instances, recusal properly occurs <em>sua sponte </em>for personal reasons which remain known only to the jurist.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[100,665,755,1482]]]'>On the other hand where, as here, a party’s recusal request is granted for reasons having nothing to do with the jurist’s alleged partiality, but instead for reasons deriving from a generic concern such as the appellate delay that may result if the aggrieved party appeals, there is no reason to defer to the self-disqualifying jurist’s determination at all. As has been noted above, appellate delay is a possibility anytime the trial court rules upon a contested issue because such rulings always leave one party aggrieved. If that generic prospect properly warrants recusal in one case, it necessarily warrants recusal in all cases. Since the generic concern with appellate delay is ever-present, the question of whether and when the prospect of avoiding the delay justifies granting a meritless re-cusal motion should not vary from case to case or judge to judge. It is a question which should be definitively answered by this Court, and its answer should apply equally in all similar cases. Therefore, I would hold as a matter of law that the ever-present prospect that the losing party may seek an interlocutory appeal is not a proper ground upon which to grant a mer-itless motion for recusal.</p>

R.Crim.P. 903(C) as justifying the PCRA judge’s recusal decision. But, the only “interest of justice” cited by the PCRA judge was the prospect of appellate delay, a prospect which inheres in every contested decision. The interests of justice are not served by converting the party which should lose a motion on the merits into the prevailing party, merely in an attempt to appease that party and prevent it from seeking appellate review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

It is notable in this regard that appellee candidly does not attempt to defend the recu-sal decision on the grounds cited by the PCRA court or the lead opinion, but instead renews her merits-based recusal argument. I would reject that argument on the basis of the opinion below.</p>
