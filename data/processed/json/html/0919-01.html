Carefully explaining to the youths that they were not arresting them, the officers requested that they accompany them to the Bangor Police Station and there submit to questioning. Without complaint or protest the youg men readily acceded to the request. At the Police Station Detective Thurston took the defendant into an office.

Clark took over in place of Detective Thurston. Without re-advising defendant of his “Miranda” rights or himself asking any questions of defendant, Lt. Clark proceeded to have a police stenographer listen to and record defendant’s repetition of his oral admission. It was then transcribed into a typed statement. When this was submitted to defendant to read and sign, defendant told Lt. Clark that he was unable to read. Lt. Clark then read the written statement to defendant, and defendant signed it.

Defendant claims, second, that the written statement ultimately taken by Lt. Clark was vitiated as to its “voluntariness” because Lt.

The law recognizes that a defendant may effect a waiver in fact by conduct other than the use of words expressly signifying a waiver. Here, the record reveals that by the totality of his conduct in the circumstances defendant objectively manifested a waiver. As the Illinois Supreme Court has observed:</p>

Clark replaced Detective Thurston, he undertook no independent interrogation of defendant prior to defendant’s repetition, for recording and transcription purposes, of the statement defendant had previously given orally to Detective Thurston. Moreover, Lt. Clark’s arrival in the interrogation room was practically simultaneous with Detective Thurston’s departure, and the substitution of officers occurred not more than approximately twenty minutes after defendant had already been fully informed of his constitutional rights by Detective Thurston. There was, in short, sufficient continuity to justify a conclusion by the presiding Justice that, fundamentally, a single unitary transaction was involved, and Lt. Clark’s substitution for Detective Thurston produced nothing essentially new to require a re-affirmation of the “Miranda” warnings.</p>
