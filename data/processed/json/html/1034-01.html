Approximately five minutes later, a third man, later identified as Burkett, arrived at the comer and engaged in conversation with the other two men for several minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Burkett then walked across the street toward Officer Riddick carrying two clear plastic bags. <em>Id. </em>at 15.

Such a claim must be presented to the trial court while it exercises jurisdiction over a matter since “[ajppellate review of a weight claim is a review of the exercise of discretion, not of the underlying question of whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.” <em>Commonwealth v. Widmer, </em><a href="/pa/560/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="560 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="95754" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0308-01">560 Pa. 308</a>, <a href="/a2d/744/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="744 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="11491051,95754" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/0745-01,/pa/560/0308-01">744 A.2d 745</a>, 753 (2000) (citation omitted). Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 607 ensures the timely presentation, and preservation, of weight claims by requiring that “[a] claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence <em>shall </em>be raised with the trial judge in a motion for a new trial: (1) orally, on the record, at any time before sentencing; (2) by written motion at any time before sentencing; or (3) in a post-sentence motion.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 607(A) (emphasis added). Burkett did not avail himself of any of the prescribed methods of presenting his weight claim to the trial court and, therefore, that claim has been waived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Pa.R.A.P. 2101, 2119. In our view, this claim is also little more than an attempt by Burkett to recast his weight of the evidence claim, which we have already determined is waived, in terms of sufficiency of the evidence. As explained above, it was within the province of the trial court, as the trier of fact, to pass upon Officer Riddick’s credibility and decide whether to believe all, part or none of his testimony. <em>Nicotra. </em>The trial court obviously credited the officer’s testimony and we decline Burkett’s invitation to review that determination.</p>

Officer Riddick observed Burkett, in a known drug-trafficking area, carrying and inspecting two plastic bags that resembled the type of packaging commonly used for illegal narcotics. Riddick then watched Burkett stash one of the bags into some shrubbery. Minutes later, Officer Ritchie searched the shrubbery and discovered a plastic bag containing 7.63 grams of crack cocaine divided into thirty-seven smaller bags. Viewing the above evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, we find that the evidence was sufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Burkett illegally possessed a controlled substance.</p>
