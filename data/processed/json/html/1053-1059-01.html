We also directed the trial court to determine whether Mr. Mims was “voluntarily impoverished”' within the meaning of Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law § 12-201(b)(2) (1992) and <em>John O. v.

The husband again appeals, contending that the trial court should have held evidentiary hearings on both the child support guidelines and the voluntary impoverishment issues. The husband also argues that the trial court erred in calculating his child support obligations, and erred by ordering the sale of real property located in Maryland (the marital residence).</p>

Therefore, we again remand the case with direction that the trial court make the specific findings and determinations that are required under Maryland law. Moreover, it would appear, in light of Mr. Mims’s contention that he has not been able to obtain substitute employment, that the trial court should receive evidence on the issue of voluntary impoverishment.</p>
