The bar patrons in this case were the victims of a robbery and murder that occurred when they parked their car in a public lot behind the bar. Although the bar management was aware of crime in the area, they encouraged prospective patrons to come, noting “free parking directly behind” the bar. Nevertheless, plaintiffs failed to produce facts sufficient to create an inference that the bar owner controlled the parking lot or was otherwise responsible for its patrons’ exposure to criminal conduct in the area. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the complaint upon the bar owner’s motion for summary judgment.</p>

    <p id="b451-16" data-blocks='[["BL_451.18",451,[911,350,753,655]]]'>This case involves the December 1999 robbery and murder that occurred in a parking lot near the Bottlecaps Bar and Restaurant (Bottlecaps). At approximately 10:00 p.m. on December 18, 1999, Stephanie Krueck and Denise Rhudy entered a public parking lot owned by the Wilmington Parking Authority (WPA) located at Eighth and Orange Streets,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> just behind Bottlecaps. Earlier that day they had heard a radio advertisement for a band they were interested in seeing perform at Bottlecaps that night.</p>
    <p id="b451-17" data-blocks='[["BL_451.19",451,[910,1030,754,606]]]'>Rhudy and Krueck did not reach Bottle-caps that evening. When Rhudy parked her car in the Orange Street Lot, an assailant approached the car and robbed the two women at gunpoint. When Rhudy told the assailant she did not have any money, the robber shot her twice. Rhudy died in the parking lot from wounds inflicted by the gun shots. The assailant also attempted to shoot Krueck, but the bullet passed through her coat, leaving Krueck physically unharmed.</p>
    <p id="b451-18" data-blocks='[["BL_451.20",451,[908,1661,754,598]]]'>Krueck and Rhudy’s estate brought actions in the Superior Court claiming that Bottlecaps was civilly liable for wrongful death as a result of the robbery and murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> According to Krueck, she and Rhu-dy decided to park in the Orange Street Lot because the Bottlecaps radio advertisement mentioned that parking behind the bar was available.

Bottlecaps did not own or have pos-sessory rights to the Lot. Nor did it have any express agreement with WPA to use the Lot. The WPA made the Lot available, on a nonexclusive basis, to downtown merchants and patrons for free parking after 8:00 p.m. on weekdays and all day on the weekends. Bottlecaps indirectly benefit-ted from the availability of free parking in the Lot, however. Because the public streets directly in front of and behind Bottlecaps typically could accommodate parking for only Bottlecaps’ employees, the Orange Street Lot offered off-street parking for the majority of Bottlecaps’ patrons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Bottlecaps frequently ran radio advertisements mentioning that “there’s plenty of free parking directly behind Bottlecaps.”</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[209,1287,753,612]]]'>Bottlecaps also assumed some minor responsibilities for the Lot. The WPA encountered extensive litter on the Lot following weekends and assumed Bottlecaps patrons were responsible. The WPA threatened to discontinue after-hours parking unless Bottlecaps remedied the problem. Thereafter and in response, when Bottlecaps hosted large outdoor events, it required the bar employees to pick up trash around the Lot before completing their shift.</p>

Crime increasingly had become a problem in the area. Bottlecaps’ employees often had their cars broken into. On the Orange Street Lot, bar patrons frequently encountered aggressive panhandlers, and some patrons had been robbed. A Bottlecaps patron was robbed on the Lot the night before the shooting at issue in this case, and the management was aware of this crime. In response to the crime in the area, Bottlecaps hired off-duty police officers for security during special events when management expected large crowds. Bottlecaps did not take any additional precautions for ordinary nights when an average turn-out was expected, however.</p>
    <p id="b452-8" data-blocks='[["BL_452.10",452,[1010,758,750,660]]]'>Reviewing the evidence upon Bottlecaps’ motion for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that the recited facts were insufficient to hold Bottlecaps civilly responsible for the wrongful death resulting from the December 18 robbery and murder on the Lot. The trial court reasoned that because Bottlecaps did not possess or control the Orange Street Lot, it did not owe a duty to warn or protect Rhudy and Krueek from crime on the Lot. The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>

The trial court erred, according to the plaintiffs, by inquiring only into whether or not Bottlecaps controlled the Orange Street Lot. Rhudy and Krueck argued that because Bottlecaps received an economic benefit from the location of the Lot and exploited that benefit by advertising free public access to the Lot for its patrons, the duty Bottlecaps owed its invitees extended beyond the bar property to encompass a duty to warn patrons about criminal activity on the adjacent premises.</p>

Because Bottlecaps did not anticipate a large crowd on December 18 and the plaintiffs have not produced evidence to contradict defendant’s assertion that the bar hosted an average size crowd on December 18, we do not address the plaintiffs’ assumption of duty argument.</p>
