They allege that the defendants — all NVIDIA directors and/or officers — either sold stock at a time when they knew material, non-public information about the company and/or are culpable for failing to prevent accounting irregularities that caused the company to restate its financial statements for the period during which the stock sales took place. The plaintiffs seek relief for NVI-DIA for harm relating to this supposed malfeasance and nonfeasance.</p>

Having failed to heed the numerous admonitions by our judiciary for derivative plaintiffs to obtain books and records before filing a complaint, the plaintiffs have unsurprisingly submitted an amended complaint that lacks particularized facts compromising the impartiality of the NVIDIA board that would have acted on a demand. When the case most cries out for the pleading of real <em>facts </em>— e.g., about the board’s knowledge of the accounting <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>problems at the company or the company’s audit committee process — the complaint is at its most cursory, substituting conclusory allegations for concrete assertions of fact.</p>

Examples would include stopping shipments before the end of a quarter to prevent revenue from being too high and using a nearly-fictional returns reserve to manage expenses as needed.

Because the outside directors were allegedly indolent in the fulfillment of their duty to make sure that the company had in place a functioning system to guarantee compliance with legally mandated accounting standards, certain managers at NVIDIA caused the company to issue materially misleading financial statements. Adver-tently or not, the outside director-defendants benefited because of the failure of oversight, by being able to sell large amounts of stock into a market artificially inflated by the company’s false financials.</p>

First, their conduct has exposed NVIDIA itself to federal securities liability for misleading investors about its financial health, and has caused NVIDIA to incur substantial costs in responding to the suits and to the SEC’s investigation. Second, NVI-DIA’s credibility as an entity has allegedly been damaged, leading investors to be skeptical of its statements about its performance.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[174,1073,754,655]]]'>To remedy this injury, the plaintiffs seek a judgment holding the defendants responsible to, among other things: (1) repay or otherwise indemnify NVIDIA for any damages it must pay or costs it must incur as a result of the federal securities suits and the SEC investigation; (2) repay all salaries and other remuneration they received from NVIDIA during the time they were committing breaches of fiduciary duty; and (3) disgorge all profits they made from trades in NVIDIA stock during the Contested Period.</p>

In this regard, it is notable that the defendants range from purely outside directors to the CFO during the Contested Period. The complaint is entirely devoid of particularized allegations of fact demonstrating that the outside directors had actual or constructive notice of the accounting improprieties. Even as to defendant Huang, the only director-defendant who was a manager, the complaint lacks particularized allegations regarding his involvement in the process of preparing the company’s financial statements.</blockquote>

In particular, they argue that the entire premise of the plaintiffs’ complaint is “ludicrous” because the restatements that NVI-DIA filed for FY 2000 through 2002 had the ultimate effect of <em>increasing </em>the company’s net income by $1.3 million, although they admit that this resulted from an increase in FY 2000 results and decreases in 2001 and 2002 results. They contend, however, that the stock market’s reaction to the restatement is the most telling fact — and one that is also left out of the complaint — namely, that the market price of NVIDIA shares increased by nearly 17% the first trading day after the announcement.</p>

To show why, it is useful to remember that the second prong of <em>Aronson </em>permits a plaintiff suing a board that is structurally independent and presumptively capable of acting impartially on a demand to proceed with its lawsuit— <em>i.e., </em>a board that passes muster under <em>Aronson’s </em>first prong, which focuses on board disinterest and independence — if it pleads a claim for breach of fiduciary duty with particularity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

The conundrum for the law in this area is well understood. If the legal rule was that demand was excused whenever, by mere notice pleading, the plaintiffs could state a breach of fiduciary duty claim against a majority of the board, the demand requirement of the law would be weakened and the settlement value of so-called “strike suits” would greatly increase, to the perceived detriment of the best interests of stockholders as investors. But, if the demand excusal test is too stringent, then stockholders may suffer as a class because the deterrence effects of meritorious derivative suits on faithless conduct may be too weak. The second prong of <em>Aronson </em>therefore balances the conflicting policy interests at stake by articulating a safety valve that releases a suit for prosecution when the complaint meets a heightened pleading standard of particularity, because in these circumstances the threat of liability to the directors required to act on the demand is sufficiently substantial to cast a reasonable doubt over their impartiality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

Although insider sales are (rightly) policed by powerful forces — including the criminal laws — to prevent insiders from unfairly defrauding outsiders by trading on non-public information, it is unwise to formulate a common law rule that makes a director “interested” whenever a derivative plaintiff cursorily alleges that he made sales of company stock in the market at a time when he possessed material, non-public information.</p>

A director cannot act loyally towards the corporation unless she acts in the good faith belief that her actions are in the corporation’s best interest.

There might be situations when a director acts in subjective good faith and is yet not loyal <em>(e.g., </em>if the director is interested in a transaction subject to the entire fairness standard and cannot prove financial fairness), but there is no case in which a director can act in subjective bad faith towards the corporation and act loyally. The reason for the disloyally (the faithlessness) is irrelevant, the underlying motive (be it venal, familial, collegial, or nihilistic) for conscious action not in the corporation's best interest does not make it faithful, as opposed to faithless.</p>
      <p id="b552-13" data-blocks='[["BL_552.11",552,[1024,1807,718,748]]]'>The General Assembly could contribute usefully to ending the balkanization of the duty of loyalty by rewriting § 102(b)(7) to make clear that its subparts all illustrate conduct that is disloyal. For example, one cannot act loyally as a corporate director by causing the corporation to violate the positive laws it is obliged to obey. <em>See </em>8 <em>Del. C. </em>§ 102(b)(7)(ii). Many recent events have only emphasized the importance of that obvious component of the duty of loyalty. But it would add no substance to our law to iterate a "quartet” of fiduciary duties, expanded to include the duty of "legal fidelity," because that requirement is already a subsidiary element of the fundamental duty of loyalty. The so-called expanded "triad[]” created by <em>Cede II, </em>I respectfully submit, is of no greater utility.</p>

In other words, the plaintiffs have failed to avail themselves of a route to demand excusal that Chancellor Chandler suggested might exist in an oversight case, namely the pleading of particularized facts that support an inference that the directors "did possess knowledge of facts suggesting potential accounting improprieties ... and took no action to respond to them.” <em>Ash, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201370341" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="2000 WL 1370341">2000 WL 1370341</a>, at *15.</p>

Because of the inadequacy of the amended complaint, it can also be said confidently that there are no well-pled facts that support an inference that the independent directors failed to meet even the level of due care that <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>is the litmus test for liability, absent an exculpatory charter provision — gross negligence. If gross negligence means something other than negligence, pleading it successfully in a case like this requires the articulation of facts that suggest a wide disparity between the process the directors used to ensure the integrity of the company’s financial statements and that which would have been rational. No factual allegations of this kind are present in the complaint.</p>
      <p id="b554-7" data-blocks='[["BL_554.2",554,[231,1139,722,888]],["BL_554.3",554,[1034,689,718,715]]]'>I raise the subject of gross negligence with hesitation, but with a case-specific justification. As an analytical matter, it is perhaps possible for the common law of Delaware corporations to consider the imposition of a disgorgement remedy on independent directors when it is proven that: (1) the corporation did not have in place a rational process to guarantee the integrity of its financial statements <em>because </em>the independent directors breached their fiduciary duty through a cognizable failure of due care (t.e., gross negligence in the words of the key precedents); (2) as a result of this gross failure in due care, company insiders caused the company to release materially misleading financial statements that led market participants to value the company’s stock at an artificially high price; and (3) the independent directors, without knowledge of the actual status of the company's financial health and subjectively believing that the financial statements were materially complete and accurate, nonetheless sold shares and profited at the expense of public buyers, and caused the company to suffer injury. In those circumstances, would the provision of § 102(b)(7) barring exculpation for improper personal benefits potentially expose the independent directors to a remedy designed to strip them of benefits that would not have been achieved had they complied with their duty of care? Because the plaintiffs have not even pled a due care violation under a gross negligence standard, they have not shown that a majority of the NVIDIA board faces a real threat of liability even if a lesser standard applies and even if the logic of this example (which I raise but do not embrace or reject) has force.</p>
      <p id="b554-9" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[1033,1412,718,582]]]'>Buried in this footnote is an alternative legal policy issue, which is whether the <em>Care-mark </em>loyalty-based standard provides the only basis of liability for a lack of oversight claim, reducing a failure of care to a violation of expected director conduct subjecting the directors to social shame and potential unseating at the polls, but not to legal liability, irrespective of the existence of an exculpatory charter provision. That may be a debatable proposition, but, as I understand it, the well-thought out <em>Caremark </em>decision accurately reflects our law, strikes a sensible policy balance in this difficult area, and I adhere to it.</p>
