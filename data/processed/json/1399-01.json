        "text": "LenROOt, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\nThis is an appeal in a trade-mark opposition proceeding from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, affirming a decision of the examiner of trade-mark interferences, dismissing the opposition of appellant and adjudging appellee entitled to the registration for which it filed application on August 16, 1928.\nAppellee\u2019s mark consists of the notation \u201cFashion Bow,\u201d used upon men\u2019s youths\u2019, and boys\u2019 outer clothing, and upon ladies\u2019 misses\u2019, and girls\u2019 suits, coats, dresses, etc. Its application states that said mark has been used by it since August 3, 1928.\nThe opposition is based upon prior adoption and use by appellant of the notation \u201c Fashion Park \u201d as a trade-mark upon men\u2019s outer clothing, for which appellant has secui'ed the following three registrations: No. 130566, issued April 27, 1920; No. 131225, issued May 4, 1920, and No. 160277, issued October 17, 1922. Each of said registrations, in addition to the words \u201c'Fashion Park,\u201d have a representation of two men on horseback. The marks in said registration differ in minor respects, but the words \u201cFashion Park \u201d are the dominating feature of all of them.\nThe marks of the respective parties are used on identical goods, viz, men\u2019s outer clothing.\nThe question before us is whether the marks of the respective parties so closely resemble each other as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive purchasers, when appropriated to men\u2019s clothing.\nThe testimony shows that appellant has continuously used its mark upon men\u2019s outer clothing for more than 15 years, and for several years has been carrying on a very extensive national advertising campaign, using the words \u201cFashion Park\u201d therein as the leading feature of such advertising; that in said advertising campaign it expends approximately $500,000 annually.\nThe commissioner, in dismissing the opposition, relied upon the case of Franklin Knitting Mills, Inc. v. Kassmam, & Kessner, Inc., 56 App. D. C. 348, 13 F. (2d) 319, and the decision of this court in the case of Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Horowitz, 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 641, 35 F. (2d) 784, as controlling his decision.\nThe marks involved in the Franklin Knitting Mills case, supra, were \u201cFashion Knit\u201d and \u201cFashion Park,\u201d used upon hats and caps. The case of Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Horowitz, supra, involved the trade-mark \u201c Fashion Park,\u201d owned by the predecessor of the appellant here, and the trade-mark \u201c Washington Park,\u201d both marks being used upon men\u2019s outer clothing. In- both of said cases the marks were held not to be confusingly similar. However, in view of the differences between the marks \u201c Fashion Knit,\u201d \u201c Washington Park,\u201d and \u201cFashion Row,\u201d the mark here in issue, we do not think the decisions in the above cases are in anywise controlling of the question before us.\nA case more in point is that of Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Wetherby-Kayser Shoe Co., 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 794, 37 F. (2d) 437, which involved the said trade-mark \u201c Fashion Park,\u201d used upon men\u2019s outer clothing, and the mark \u201c Fashion Lane,\u201d used on men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and children\u2019s footwear, namely, shoes, slippers, etc. In the opinion in that case, this court, speaking through Presiding Judge Graham, said:\nIn -considering tliis matter [confusion or mistake] it will be borne in mind tbat tbe goods upon which the opposer uses its trade-marks are men\u2019s coats, vests, pants, and overcoats, and that the goods upon which the appellee applicant uses its mark are men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and children\u2019s footwear, such as shoes, and so forth. Whether these be considered goods of the same descriptive properties or not their similarity or lack of similarity is a very proper matter to be considered in determining whether such confusion or mistake in the mind of the public is liable to occur by the registration of the appellee\u2019s mark.\nWhile the court held in that case that the marks \u201c Fashion Park \u201d and \u201cFashion Lane \u201d were not so similar as to cause confusion, when applied to the goods upon which the respective marks were used, it is clear that had said marks been used upon identical goods, as in the case at bar, a different question would have been' presented.\nFor the reasons stated we do not think that any prior decision of this court is determinative of the issue in the case at bar.\nIn considering whether the marks here in issue are confusingly similar, an important fact to 'be considered is that the marks are used upon identical goods.\nThe words \u201c Fashion Park \u201d suggest to the mind a park frequented by people fashionably clothed. The words \u201c Fashion Row \u201d suggest to the mind a street or row frequented by people fashionably clothed.\nWe believe that one going into a store to purchase a suit of clothes, having read an advertisement of \u201c Fashion Park \u201d clothes, might easily think his memory was faulty as to the word \u201c Park \u201d in the advertisement and conclude that a suit bearing the trade-mark \u201c Fashion Row \u201d was manufactured by the same party whose advertisement he had read.\n. In our opinion, the marks \u201c Fashion Park \u201d and \u201c Fashion Row,\u201d used upon men\u2019s outer clothing, so nearly resemble each other as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive purchasers, and the commissioner erred in dismissing the opposition and granting the application of appellee.\nWe are, furthermore, of the opinion that appellee selected the mark \u201cFashion Row\u201d with the expectation of profiting by appellant\u2019s extensive advertising of its trade-mark \u201c Fashion Park.\u201d We say this because there were a multitude of words which appellee might have selected as a trade-mark as to which there would be no likelihood of confusion with appellant\u2019s mark. This fact, while not determinative of our conclusion, tends to confirm it. On this point we quote from the opinion in the case of Guggenheim v. Cantrell & Cochrane, Ltd., 56 App. D. C. 100, 10 F. (2d) 895, as follows:\nIn this court it has been repeatedly declared that there is neither legal nor moral excuse for even an approximate simulation of a well-known mark applied to goods of tlie same descriptive properties, and that, when an attempt to effect such simulation becomes apparent, the two marks' should not be examined with a microscope to detect minute differences but, on the contrary, should be viewed as a whole, as the general public would view them;-in other words, that the points of similarity are of greater importance than the points of difference.\nThe decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.",
