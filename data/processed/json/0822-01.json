        "text": "OPINION\nHERLIHY, Judge.\nWawa, Inc., has sought approval from New Castle County to convert its current convenience store at Tybouts Corner to a larger store and one which would also sell gasoline. To accomplish this change, it sought a variance from the New Castle County Board of Adjustment.\nThe Board denied Wawa\u2019s application. In doing so, it employed the standard pertinent to use variance requests, namely, that the applicant must show \u201cunnecessary hardship.\u201d Wawa\u2019s current store is a proper use for the zone in which it is located and the surface commercial zone would permit such a use. But the lot on which it sits is on or closely proximate to important water resources. As a result, current New Castle County ordinances relating to subsurface conditions prohibit the construction of new gasoline pumping and underground storage tanks any such area. A variance would, therefore, be needed.\nThe \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d standard employed to test \u201cuse\u201d variances is triggered when the proposed use is for a purpose contrary to zoning laws or regulations. While Wawa\u2019s current store is a proper use, the dispensing of petroleum products and the adjunct storage needed to do so otherwise would block Wawa\u2019s proposed use. It, however, points to the existence of two gasoline stations in current operation on other corners of the same Tybouts Corner intersection where its proposed gasoline station would be located. That fact, however, does not trigger the less stringent test for an area variance, which is a variance not proposing a usage otherwise prohibited. Those service stations are non-confirming uses.\nThe Board indicated its decision was the first one raising the issue of an above ground permitted use with a prohibition based on sub-surface circumstances prohibiting such use. The Court notes the issue as one novel to Delaware law.\nIt concludes, nevertheless, that the Board applied the appropriate standard by judging Wawa\u2019s application as one for a use variance. Its decision denying the application is supported by substantial evidence and is free of legal error. Its decision is AFFIRMED.\nProcedural History\nWawa, following the bureaucratic maze, first filed an application with the New Castle County Department of Land Use for approval of a minor land development plan seeking permission to renovate its current convenience store with a larger store with gasoline pumping facilities. In its letter of June 19, 2002, to Wawa, the Department denied the application stating the proposal was in substantial non-compliance with the New Castle County Unified Development Code (UDC). Wawa was instructed to address stated issues and submit a revised Exploratory Plan Application.\nAs required by UDC \u00a7 40.10.385, Wawa presented its revised application to the Resource Protection Area Technical Advisory Committee (RPATAC). On April 16, 2008, after reviewing the environmental impact assessment report and supplemental information and testimony, RPATAC recommended that the Board deny the variance. Wawa\u2019s proposed gasoline station is located in what is classified as a Water Resource Protection Area (WRPA). The UDC prohibits from such areas the type of facility Wawa proposed. RPATAC voted against a recommendation that it approve Wawa\u2019s application.\nWawa then applied for a public hearing before the Board of Adjustment on a vari-anee to a store and dispense fuel at its Tybouts Corner site which is in a WRPA. The Board voted to deny the requested variance, refusing to consider the application under a hybrid use-area variance standard as Wawa suggested. This timely appeal followed.\nFacts\nWawa owns and operated a chain of convenience stores. One such store is located on the southeast corner of Hamburg Road and South DuPont Parkway (just north of the Delaware Route 1 overpass) which it has operated there for years. This location, termed the Tybouts Corner site, does not now sell gasoline products. At this same intersection there are, however, two other convenience stores owned by Wawa competitors, each selling gasoline products. The site is also within 300 feet of a public water supply well operated by Artesian Water Company.\nWawa wishes to renovate its current convenience store at Tybouts Corner. The renovation would include the installation of underground petroleum storage tanks and gasoline dispensing facilities. The 7.55 acre parcel is located within three hundred (300) feet of a Type C wellhead area, which, under the UDC, is limited to twenty (20) percent impervious surface ration. Wawa\u2019s proposal would pave over or cover about 40% of the site.\nNew Castle County revised its zoning and subdivisions codes, the UDC, effective December 31,1997, prohibiting the storage of petroleum products in floodplains, flood-ways, riparian buffers and sinkholes but permitting storage in other water resource areas provided certain containment measures were met. Under the September 22, 1998, amendments, the UDC petroleum storage area prohibitions were expanded to include wellhead class A, class B, and class C, the Cockeysville Formation, recharge areas, steep slopes, critical nature areas, and wetlands. Replacement of existing underground petroleum storage tanks in protected areas was allowed if such upgrades were required by the State of Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). The December 14, 1999, UDC amendment further expanded the prohibition on petroleum storage tanks to include drainageways.\nAs noted earlier, Wawa submitted a proposed Minor Land Development Plan to the County Department of Land Use. That Department found Wawa\u2019s Plan to be unacceptable. It raised a number of questions and objections; one, notably, related to the property\u2019s location in the water resource area. The Department said that because of the property\u2019s location in a WRPA, Wawa would have to seek approval from RPATAC and a variance from the Board of Adjustment.\nWawa went to RPATAC. Its recommendation against allowing Wawa to expand its store and sell gasoline states:\nWaWa, Inc. (\u201cApplicant\u201d) seeks a recommendation from the Resource Protection Area Technical Advisory Committee (\u201cRPATAC\u201d) -that it is acceptable, from an environmental position, to exceed the 20% inpervious cover limitation imposed within a Water Resource Protection Area (\u201cWRPA\u201d), by Division 10.380 of the United Development Code (\u201cUDC\u201d) in order to develop the site with 42% impervious cover; and to site and dispense fuel in a WRPA (otherwise prohibited by Division 10.600 of the UDC).\nIn support of its application, WaWa, Inc. retained the services of Duffield Associates, a consultant in the geosciences. Duffield Associates submitted an environmental impact assessment report to this Committee, and additional testimony was provided by the consultant, Wen-die Stabler, attorney for applicant and the applicant. Applicant testified as to the lack of available sites at intersections within the County that are not constrained by zoning or WRPA issues. (Emphasis added).\n\u2021 \u2021 \u2021\nIn support of lifting the restriction, applicable on this property, that prohibits locating fuel tanks within the WRPA, applicant explained that many gasoline stations currently exist within WRPAs. Applicants facts show that 37 or 12% of gas stations in New Castle County are in WRPAs.\nThe committee asked the age of the 37 sites within WRPAs and the consensus answer was that most if not all had been remodeled and underground tanks upgraded in the past 10-12 years. The Committee recognized that this proposal, if approved, would be the first new stations since the adoption of the ordinance prohibiting sitting and dispensing fuel within the WRPA. Furthermore, a member of the Committee stated that, despite the extraordinary precautions proposed by applicant, the only fail safe scenario was not permitting the use within the WRPA. The fact was brought out that this was a Wellhead Protection Area, not a Recharge Protection Area, and the threat to a public water supply was real. Members of the Committee explained that there was a history of losing well fields to petroleum contamination in New Castle County and that it was intentional that they were prohibited from WRPAs and that no engineering option to mitigate the potential threat was provided in the UDC.\nIn the final analysis, the Committee acknowledged the thoroughness of the application and the extraordinary measures proposed to prevent, detect and contain leaks. It is the position of this Committee that an application .of this nature best be addressed as a text amendment through the public code amendment process. The votes are summarized below.\nThe next step for Wawa was the Board of Adjustment. The Board\u2019s April 20, 2004, decision says Wawa sought a use variance and that the Board was employing the unnecessary hardship test in its consideration of Wawa\u2019s application.\nThe Board noted that a gasoline station is allowed in the zoning district in which Wawa\u2019s Tybouts Corner property is located. But because of the UDC and the property\u2019s location in the WRPA, storage and sale of petroleum products are prohibited. The Board further noted that Wawa conceded its current convenience store makes a reasonable profit.\nIn its decision of April 20, 2004, the Board acknowledged the existence of other gasoline stations at the same intersection, albeit, however, non-conforming uses. It noted also that Wawa suggested its application \u201cdid not fall neatly into either the area or use variance categories.\u201d\nThe Board commented that representatives of the Artesian Water Company opposed Wawa\u2019s application.\nThe Board denied Wawa\u2019s application for a variance saying:\nThe requested relief is contrary to the public interest in safeguarding the water supply. The spirit of the zoning code would not be observed by granting the variance. The UDC does not provide an exception for gas stations with extraordinary safety measures in preventing discharge into the ground, only a blanket prohibition for new proposals. The intent of the Code to prevent further incursions into Water Resource Protection Areas would be thwarted by the request. While the UDC specifically permits nonconformities, it restricts further investments that would tent to make a nonconforming situation more permanent. UDC Division 40.08.000. Although the applicant believes that substantial justice requires the Board to allow the proposed use, since a number of other WRPAs are encumbered by nonconforming gas stations, the Board disagrees.\nIn addition to these criteria, the applicant must establish that a special condition or exceptional situation exists that result in an unnecessary hardship for the owner. The applicant did not argue that all permitted uses for the land were economically unfeasible, given the existing franchise on the site. The applicant could not argue that the need for the variance was due to a unique circumstance and not a general condition in the neighborhood. In fact, the applicant pointed to a neighboring gas station in the WRPA as a reason why the practice should be allowed on the subject property. The gas station would not alter the character of the locality, but meeting this one element is insufficient to pass the test.\nThe appeal to this Court followed.\nParties\u2019 Claims\nWawa claims that the Board erred in considering its application for a variance under the use variance standard of \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d rather than under the area variance standard of \u201cexceptional practical difficulty,\u201d or some hybrid standard. It contends that the Board never reached the merits of its case to establish that its proposed underground storage tank system would be at least as protective of the environment, if not more so, than underground storage systems already in place at the competing service stations at the Tybouts Corner location.\nThe Board responds that the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d standard is the appropriate standard contending Wawa requested a use variance and not an area variance or possibly a hybrid standard of the two standards. It adds that there is substantial evidence to support the denial of the variance.\nStandard of Review\nThis Court, on an appeal from the Board, is to determine whether its decision is supported by substantial evidence and conclusions of law are devoid of errors. Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the Board\u2019s conclusion. The Court does not weigh the evidence, determine questions of credibility, or make its own factual findings. It merely determines if the evidence is legally adequate to support the agency\u2019s factual findings.\nDiscussion\nA\nA variance application seeks permission to use property in a manner otherwise forbidden or restricted by applicable zoning regulations or laws. Relief can be classified as either use variance or area variance. An area variance is the relaxation of incidental limitations to a permitted use. Generally, it allows deviations from zoning restrictions relating to the use of the property itself, such as the height, size or extent of lot coverage, size of the buildings, placement of the building on the site or other restrictions relating to the physical characteristics of the site. A use variance permits, however, a particular piece of property to be used in a manner otherwise prohibited by applicable law or zoning regulation. A use variance is subjected to the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d test, while an area variance is subjected to the less burdensome \u201cexceptional practical difficulty\u201d test. Before a variance can be granted, the Board must find either an unnecessary hardship or exceptional practical difficulties or both.\nThe elements of the use variance standard of \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d one:\n(1) the land cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for the permissible use,\n(2) the need for the variance is due to unique circumstances and not general conditions in the neighborhood which reflect unreasonableness of the zoning itself, and\n(3) the use sought will not alter the essential character of the locality.\nThe test for area variances, \u201cexceptional practical difficulty,\u201d is less burdensome than the test for a use variance. It has these elements: (1) the nature of the zone in which the property is located, (2) the character of the immediate vicinity, (3) the uses in that vicinity, (4) whether, if the restrictions were removed, would there be a serious affect on neighborhood property and uses, and (5) if the restriction(s) were not removed, would there be a hardship on the owner to make normal improvements allowed for the use permitted in the zoning regulations for that property?\nB\nThe UDC sets forth conditions under which the Board is to hear and decide applications for variances. A variance may be granted where a denial will result in unnecessary hardship or exceptional practical difficulties to the owner of the property. In addition, a variance may be granted unless it would result in substantial detriment to the public good or is contrary to the intent and purpose of the UDC. The power to grant variances should be used sparingly and reserved for exceptional circumstances.\nC\nOn appeal, the Board first asserts that Wawa requested a use variance when it filed its request. The Court has reviewed the copy of the application form completed by Wawa. On page a-2 of the form, Wawa, indeed, checked the Use Variance box. This box is to be checked when the applicant wanted \u201cto use property for use other than that allowed by its zoning classification.... \u201d There is, however, no box titled Area Variance. The box that comes closest is titled Dimensional Variance. When checking this box, the applicant is to \u201cState size of variance being requested (example: variance from the required 6 foot side yard setback to construct [maintain] a dwelling 4.2 feet from the northerly property line).\u201d As Wawa was not requesting a variance in the dimensions of the property, this box was not applicable to its request. The other boxes to be checked, Special Use, Appeal from an Administrative Decision, Confirmation of a Non Conforming Use and Beneficial Use Appeal, were not applicable to the site in question. The Court does not find that Wawa\u2019s checking of the Use Variance box determinative as to whether Wawa requested a use variance or an area variance as there was no other applicable box.\nThe Board further contends that Wawa\u2019s counsel \u201cgrudgingly\u201d conceded that a use variance was appropriate. Wawa\u2019s counsel at the March 11, 2004 hearing stated:\nWe are here tonight on an application ah it\u2019s use variance. I suppose although I don\u2019t think the standard is technically applicable because it is a use permitted within the zoning district.\nThe Court does not find that counsel\u2019s use of the term \u201cuse variance\u201d indicated that Wawa applied for a use variance rather than an area variance, or that it is now prohibited from arguing on appeal that a hybrid standard should have been employed. The Board\u2019s very decision mentioned that Wawa contended its application did not fall \u201cneatly\u201d into either a use or area variance and that a hybrid standard should be applied.\nThe Board\u2019s decision, contrary to other arguments it now makes on appeal reveals several problems. One, there are errors of law. Two, its decision employs without saying so, a hybrid standard in denying Wawa\u2019s application.\nAs to the errors of law, the Board argues on appeal:\n[a]ny nonconforming gas station in a WRPA will face restrictions on alteration, extension and enlargement, as well as a loss of the nonconforming use if it discontinues for a six month period. UDC \u00a7\u00a7 40.08.120, 130. The grant of a variance, however, would allow a gas station to exist on the subject property in perpetuity, regardless of ownership.\nThis argument appears to mirror a statement in the Board\u2019s decision, \u201cWhile the UDC specifically permits nonconformities, it restricts further investments that would tend to make a nonconforming situation more permanent.\u201d\nThis is not a reason for the Board to deny the requested variance. The Board, being able to place conditions and restrictions on any variance it grants, could put reasonable conditions and restrictions on the Tybouts Corner site that would cause it to be treated in the same manner as the other convenience store sites in the area. The granting of the variance could easily be limited so that it would not exist in perpetuity, regardless of ownership.\nThe Board went too far in its rejection by saying \u201cThe requested relief is contrary to the public interest in safeguarding the water supply.\u201d The use variance tests do not include \u201cpublic interest,\u201d though they may need to. The Board overstepped its limited policy making role by saying this. Its overall policy is to enforce zoning rules and regulations as established by elected officials. But, of course, when it grants a use variance, it is making a very finite change in that broader zoning policy. This sentence from the Board\u2019s decision exceeds that limited role.\nThe sentence is also ironic because, in reviewing Wawa\u2019s proposal, RPATAC said, \u201cIt is the position of this Committee that an application of this nature best be addressed as a text amendment through the public code amendment process.\u201d That would be the UDC, County Council and the County Executive but not the Board.\nThe Board\u2019s pronouncement reveals that it, in fact, utilized a hybrid approach in rejecting Wawa\u2019s application. What it said borders on the \u201ccharacter of the immediate vicinity and affect on neighboring properties\u201d tests employed as part of judging an application for an area variance. The character of the vicinity and \u201cneighboring\u201d properties, however, in this case are all underground.\nThe surface zoning designation for the property on which Wawa\u2019s convenience store is located permits a gasoline station to be operated. But it is the subsurface water resource location which, without a variance, would prohibit such a use. Wawa\u2019s application, while mainly a use variance, is not easily pigeonholed into solely a use or an area variance as those terms and tests have been traditionally used and applied. Perhaps, unwittingly, by creating this hybrid zoning classification, the UDC has blurred the traditional lines between a use variance and an area variance.\nThe increasing complexity of zoning, primarily and traditionally aimed at surface land use, coupled with more recent heightened concerns about environmental matters, such as here with water resources, and soon with flood prevention and maybe air pollution, demands new tests. The meaning of public policy continues to evolve and becomes inclusive of more factors such as protection of water resources, flood prevention, and air quality.\nAs the record in this case shows, this is the first case of this kind. Wawa argued before RPATAC and the Board that there were other gasoline stations in WRPAs in other areas of the county. What is not clear from the record, however, is whether, as the Board thought, the stations in those areas are non-conforming uses such as the two stations across the road from Wawa\u2019s site. The breadth of the interrelationship between surface Use and regulated subsurface reflected in this record also highlights the need to employ other or additional tests and not be straight-jacketed by \u201csurface only\u201d tests.\nE\nWawa, as the party seeking to over turn the Board\u2019s decision, bears the burden of persuasion to show that the Board\u2019s decision was unreasonable and arbitrary. In meeting the burden of showing unnecessary hardship, it must appear:\n(1) That the property cannot yield a reasonable return when used for a permitted use; (2) that the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and (3) that the use authorized will not alter the essential character of the locality.\nEconomic hardship alone is not, in and of itself, sufficient to justify the granting of a variance. The fact that the site could be put to a more profitable use does not establish unnecessary hardship when less profitable alternatives are available within the zoning classification. Before a use variance can be granted, Wawa must also show, by monetary proof, that all uses permitted of the land under existing zoning are economically unfeasible.\nWawa did show that its plight was due to unique circumstances. Those would be its location in this WRPA site. That is the same WRPA where the two gasoline stations across the street are located. But they are non-conforming uses \u201cgrandfathered\u201d by the UDC.\nThe key element of the use variance unnecessary hardship test is that the proposed use will not alter the essential character of the locality. The UDC, however, now mixes the traditional zoning approach of trying to keep compatible surface uses with a newer concern for subsurface circumstances. Utilizing the character of the locality approach in its traditional way strongly suggests that regulatory agencies and the reviewing courts may need to expand their horizons of what it means in a mixed regulatory situation, as here, and how it is to be applied and reviewed.\nThis case shows why. With two gasoline stations already at the same intersection, which have been there for years, Wawa\u2019s service station would not alter the \u201cessential character\u201d of the surface area of the intersection of Hamburg Road and U.S. 13/DuPont Highway (Tybouts Corner).\nThere is even an arguable basis that adding a service station to this WRPA would not alter its \u201ccharacter\u201d. That is because of the two existing stations, either one or both of which presently create the same risk to the water resource as Wawa\u2019s service station would. The Board and RPATAC even observed that Wawa\u2019s station would represent less of such a risk due to the extraordinary safety precautions Wawa designed into its proposal; a level of protection likely greater than existing at either of the other two stations. But their presence is allowed under UDC grandfathering provisions. This undercuts Wawa\u2019s ai\u2019gument.\nThe danger to this, particular WRPA by Wawa\u2019s proposal, however, is probably not immediate. It would be unlike allowing a gasoline station to be built in the middle of a suburban development. In that situation the obvious and immediate incompatibility is palpable as is the alteration of the essential character of the community. The \u201ccharacter\u201d of the WRPA in this area would not be altered until and unless there was a leakage by Wawa\u2019s gasoline operations into the WRPA. The Board, therefore, expanded the character test without express acknowledgment but did so because of the UDC\u2019s regulatory mixture of surface and subsurface conditions and which, in turn, injected the factor of \u201crisk\u201d into \u201ccharacter.\u201d\nWhile the Board does not enjoy unlimited discretion, the amendment to the UDC, which for the first time prohibits Wawa\u2019s proposal (or anything like it), is very recent. The record here shows that (1) the proposed usage is new, to the subsurface, i.e., not non-conforming and (2) when the Board, in part predicated on RPATAC\u2019s decision, chose to protect this water resource, it had to draw a line. Based on the record and the Board\u2019s decision, the Court cannot say the decision was unreasonable or arbitrary.\nWawa also admits it is not able to meet another part of the unnecessary hardship test as it can not to prove all uses of the economically zoned property are economically unfeasible. It has successfully operated a convenience store without gasoline pumps on the site for many years. The Board, based on that undisputed record, was correct in denying Wawa a variance to install gasoline pumps under the unnecessary hardship standard for a use variance as the most applicable of the two variance standards.\nF\nWawa argues that it requested an area variance, not a use variance. As the facts before the Court do not exactly fit the description of a use variance, as discussed above, the Court will discuss the exceptional practical difficulties standard applied to applications for use variances.\nFor an area variance to be considered, the land must burdened, not the landowner personally. The land is burdened in the case before the Court.\nWhen reviewing an area variance request, the Board must look to \u201cwhether a literal interpretation of the zoning law results in exceptional practical difficulties of ownership.\u201d In addition, the Board is to consider:\nThe nature of the zone in which the property lies, the character of the immediate vicinity and the uses contained therein, whether, if the restriction upon the applicant\u2019s property were removed, such removal would seriously affect such neighboring property and uses; and whether, if the restriction is not removed, the restriction would create unnecessary hardship or exceptional practical difficulty for the owner in relation to his efforts to make normal improvements on the character of that use of the property which is a permitted use under the use provisions of the ordinance.\nIn its April 20, 2004 decision, the Board focused its attention on the WRPA and possible effects a leaking gasoline storage tank might have on the water wells. It did not consider the other convenience stores in the immediate area, the character of the area other than the wellheads, and the practical difficulty Wawa would meet in its attempt to make normal improvements to its site.\n\u201cEconomic benefit and/or hardship may constitute exceptional practical difficulty for purposes of an area variance where the change sought is \u2018minimal\u2019 \u201d The local zoning, Commercial Regional zoning district, permits convenience stores at Tybouts Corner. In addition to the Wawa store, there are two other convenience stores, both with gasoline pumps, in close proximity to the Wawa site. In the current marketplace, many convenience stores provide pumping facilities for their customers. Wawa\u2019s proposal will not change the character of the district. The change sought by Wawa is minimal.\nA legitimate exceptional practical difficulty may exist and the granting of a variance may be justified when there is the inability to improve one\u2019s business, or to stay competitive as a result of area limitations. The limitation at this site, the UDC prohibition against petroleum storage tanks in a Type C wellhead area, deals only with the physical characteristics of the site. This prohibition restricts Wawa\u2019s ability to improve its business and compete on an equal footing with two other area convenience stores. As there are at least two petroleum storage facilities in the immediate area, the character of the zoned district would not be changed by the proscribed use if the variance were granted. There is the question of whether the addition of petroleum storage tanks would change the subsurface of the area. The tanks would not necessarily change the nature of the area\u2019s wells. There is the possibility that they could, but not necessarily would, do so if one or more of the storage tanks sprung a leak.\nThe existing convenience stores with gasoline pumps are not required to close. These stores may replace the storage tanks only if all State and Federal regulations are met. Wawa wants to be treated as if it already had underground storage tanks in place. Wawa\u2019s request for a variance is not to change from one nonconforming use to another but from a conforming use to a nonconforming use. The proposed nonconforming use was not in existence at the time the UDC took effect even though the Wawa convenience store was open to the public.\nG\nThe purpose of the UDC is to specify the circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming land use is allowed to continue while restricting additional investments which would make the nonconforming use more permanent. The purpose of the UDC is to contain nonconforming uses by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and to restrict further investments that would tend to make nonconforming situations more permanent. \u201cThe perpetuation of noncompliance would substantially derogate the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance in question.\u201d Article 8 permits nonconforming situation resulting from the adoption of the UDC to continue but \u201crestricts further investments that would tend to make a nonconforming situation more permanent.\u201d The current version of the UDC prohibits the storage of petroleum products in the certain areas in the state. Tyb-outs Corner is one of the sites where such storage is prohibited.\nThe provisions in an ordinance for limiting nonconforming uses should be liberally construed. The protection of the public water supply, as embodied in the UDC, is a valid public interest. It is not enough that the public will realize a benefit, or avoid a detriment, if the vari-anee is granted. The Court holds that the use variance test of unnecessary hardship is the appropriate standard, even though not a neat fit, to be applied for a variance from the provisions of the petroleum storage provisions of the UDC. It seems to the Court that Wawa\u2019s sole reason for seeking the variance is to place it in a better competitive position with the two near-by convenience stores that offer gasoline pumps and thereby increase profits at the Tybouts Corner site. Economic competition may be a valid concern for an area variance.\n(Amended September 22, 1998, by Ordinance 98-080; amended December 14, 1999, by Ordinance 99-075).\nUDC \u00a7 40.10.600.\nThe addition of gasoline pumps would not change the character of the area and Wawa would perhaps suffer in its inability to improve its business. There is no information that the installation of the pumps would result in substantial damage to the public good. However, the fact that there might be substantial damage to the public good and the installation of the petroleum storage tanks would be contrary to the intent and purpose of the UDC, requires the finding that the granting of an area variance is inappropriate in the circumstances before the Court.\nConclusion\nThe Court finds that the Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary nor unreasonable, and that it was supported by legally substantial evidence. Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Adjustment of New Castle County is AFFIRMED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n. Minor land development.
