        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nPetitioner was arrested for and charged in a criminal information with drunk driving. The Department of Motor Vehicles held a hearing on whether or not petitioner\u2019s license should be suspended pending a determination by the court in the criminal proceedings. The arresting officer testified that he responded to an accident call and observed that petitioner\u2019s \u201ceyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred and there was a moderate odor of alcohol on his breath\u201d and \u201chis balance was slightly unsteady.\u201d The officer further testified that, according to the laboratory report in his possession, the result of a urinalysis of petitioner taken about two hours after the arrest was \u201cZero-two-one, ethyl alcohol.\u201d (R. 17.) The hearing officer did not himself examine this report.\nPetitioner testified that he had had two beers before this incident but was not drunk. Another witness corroborated petitioner\u2019s story. The hearing officer concluded that upon the testimony presented petitioner had been operating his auto under the influence of intoxicating liquor and ordered his license suspended \u201cpending the final disposition of charges pending in court.\u201d\nSubsequently, the Corporation Counsel nolled the criminal information against petitioner. Nevertheless, the Department proceeded against petitioner to revoke his license for operating his vehicle on the day of the incident in question so \u201cas to show flagrant disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d See Bungardeanu v. England, D.C.App., 219 A.2d 104, 107-108 (1966). The arresting officer had resigned from the force and did not appear at this second hearing and petitioner was this time represented by counsel. The hearing officer began this second hearing by reading \u201ca statement of facts that was brought out of that [the prior] hearing,\u201d which contained (1) the officer\u2019s observations of petitioner at the scene of the arrest and (2) the officer\u2019s description of the results of the urinalysis. After hearing testimony by petitioner and argument by his counsel, the hearing officer revoked for six months petitioner\u2019s driving permit upon the basis of the officer\u2019s testimony at the prior hearing and the urinalysis (R. 36, 38) .\nIn reviewing the record we note that the hearing officer never examined the laboratory report of the urinalysis about which the police officer testified that it had been \u201czero-two-one, ethyl alcohol,\u201d nor does the record contain this report. We do not know whether the witness meant by his testimony that petitioner\u2019s urine contained .021 or 0.21 ethyl alcohol. There is a critical difference for the purposes of this case between these alternative interpretations because under Traffic and Motor Vehicle Regulations then in effect a showing of .21 ethyl alcohol constitutes prima facie proof that petitioner was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Corporation Counsel urges that petitioner cannot challenge on this appeal the officer\u2019s testimony since his counsel failed to complain at the revocation hearing of the police officer\u2019s prior testimony. However, petitioner\u2019s counsel did not have the transcript of the testimony and the hearing officer unequivocally advised him that the urinalysis had showed .21 ethyl alcohol (R. 34, 36, 37).\nWe are of opinion that the police officer\u2019s testimony concerning the urinalysis should not have been accorded any probative weight. Since the hearing officer expressly relied upon this particular testimony in reaching his decision (R. 36, 38) , we are constrained to reverse respondent\u2019s order and remand the case for a new hearing at which the relevant evidence should be properly presented. Braniff Airways, Inc. v. C.A.B., 126 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 412, 379 F.2d 453, 466 (1967). See Dietrich v. Tarleton, 473 F.2d 177, 179 (D.C.Cir. 1972).\nSo ordered.\n. A pedestrian had walked into the side of appellant\u2019s car and required medical attention. A citation was later issued against the pedestrian.\n. The transcript of the first or \u201csuspension\u201d hearing was not prepared until well after the second or \u201crevocation\u201d hearing was concluded.\n. The Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles affirmed the order of revocation.\n. See Burgardeanu v. England, supra at 108-109. See Respondent's Brief, p. 7 n. 2.\n.We note the following colloquy between petitioner and the hearing officer at the first hearing (R. 22):\nRESPONDENT: . . . I\u2019m trying to tell you the truth as far as I know how. I\u2019m telling you the truth.\nHEARING OFFICER: Well, you had a .21 urinalysis Mr. Reap, you\u2019re telling me you had only two beers.
