Thomas Cotroneo v. The Alpine Country Club, No. 90-554-Appeal (Order, entered October 18, 1991) and S. Thomas Cotroneo v. The Alpine Investment Company, No. 91-41-Appeal (Order, entered October 18, 1991). Most recently the plaintiff challenges his expulsion from the Alpine Country Club after hearing before the Board of Directors of said club.\nA justice of the Superior Court denied plaintiffs request for injunctive relief. The plaintiff appeals from this judgment. We are of the opinion that the trial justice was correct in declining to interfere with the internal affairs of a voluntary association, since due process in accordance with the rules and bylaws of that association was accorded to the plaintiff. See Hebert v. Ventetuolo, 480 A.2d 403 (R.I.1984); Bartley v. Augusta Country Club, 254 Ga. 144, 326 S.E.2d 442 (1985).\nConsequently, the plaintiffs appeal is denied and dismissed. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nLEDERBERG, J., did not participate.",
