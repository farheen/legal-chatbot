        "text": "WASHINGTON, Associate Judge:\nThis case tests the limits of a trial court\u2019s authority to reserve to itself the power to direct the placement and treatment of juveniles once those juveniles have been committed to the District of Columbia Department of Human Services (DHS) or another such agency. Appellant, the District of Columbia, contends that the trial court lacks statutory jurisdiction to direct administrative agencies where to place and how to treat juveniles, who have been adjudicated delinquent and placed in the custody of that agency. We agree with the District of Columbia that in juvenile delinquency proceedings, as distinct from abuse and neglect cases, the court no longer has the statutory authority to direct the placement or future treatment of juveniles who have been committed to a public agency, such as DHS. Therefore, we vacate the trial court\u2019s order to the extent that it directs the placement and treatment of P.S. and remand the case to the trial court for any farther actions consistent with this opinion.\nOn October 10, 2001, P.S. was charged with robbery, unauthorized use of a vehicle and receiving stolen property. P.S. was adjudicated delinquent after pleading guilty to unauthorized use of a vehicle and receiving stolen property on January 29, 2002. On July 26, 2002, the trial court presided over a disposition hearing for P.S. The court placed P.S. in the custody of DHS pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2320(c)(2) (2001) and then instructed DHS to put P.S. in the Pines Residential Treatment Center (hereinafter the \u201cPines\u201d), a treatment facility that could keep him until age twenty-one. Additionally, in a supplemental order, the court made various directives to DHS regarding P.S.\u2019s treatment.\nThe District\u2019s main contention is that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority when it issued a supplemental order requiring DHS to: 1) place P.S. in a particular treatment facility; 2) obtain permission from the court before transferring P.S. to another facility; and 3) provide specific treatment modalities for P.S. According to the District, the provisions in the supplemental order that involve the exercise of post-dispositional judicial authority include the following paragraphs:\n3. The Respondent shall remain in secure detention at the Oak Hill Youth Center until such time as space is available for the Respondent at the Pines Residential Treatment Center, Crawford Campus (hereinafter \u201cthe Pines\u201d). DHS shall make all necessary arrangements for the Respondent\u2019s placement in the Pines facility, and provide for, inter alia, placement therein as soon as a space becomes available;\n4. In no event shall Respondent\u2019s placement in the Pines, or any other therapeutic residential treatment facility occur more than 30 days after the date of this Order;\n6. This Court reserves jurisdiction over this matter to, inter alia, review and approve of any therapeutic residential treatment facility, transitional and or independent living program, or other placement for the Respondent. The Respondent may not be placed in any therapeutic residential treatment facility, transitional and or independent living program, or other location without the prior approval of this Court;\n7. Any therapeutic residential treatment facility, and subsequent transitional and or independent living program shall, inter alia, provide the Respondent with the services recommended in the: Psychiatric Evaluation, dated May 29, 2002, by Floyd B. Galler, M.D., L.F.A.P.A., Staff Psychiatrist, and the Psychological Evaluation, dated May 23, 2002, by Celeste Showers Sulc, Psychology Intern, any other existing or subsequent physical, mental health, and/or educational evaluations including but not limited to: individual therapy; include in-patient substance abuse treatment; antidepressant medication (as indicated after assessment at the Pines); a special education program or GED program; and vocational training;\n8. This Court reserves jurisdiction over this matter to, inter alia, determine when and whether the Respondent should be released from the Pines, or any other therapeutic treatment facility, to live with a family member, placed in foster care, placed in a Group Home, transitional and/or independent living program, or any other placement is appropriate;\n9.DHS shall provide the Respondent with any and all services recommended by the Pines, or any other therapeutic residential treatment facility, and any physical, mental health, or other evaluation to ensure Respondent\u2019s continued care and rehabilitation.\nWe have held that in exercising its dispositional authority in delinquency cases, the court must act pursuant to \u201cspecifically granted authority.\u201d In re J.M.W., 411 A.2d 345, 348 (D.C.1980). D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2320 (2001) provides the authority for trial judges to issue dispositions in neglect and delinquency cases, and it is the statute that the District of Columbia relies upon to support its contention that the above cited provisions of the supplemental order are unlawful. Subsection (a) of this statute describes the extent of the trial court\u2019s authority in neglect cases, while subsection (c) describes that authority in delinquency cases. Subsection (c) permits Family Court judges handling delinquency matters to exercise most of the options available in subsection (a). According to \u00a7 16-2320, if a trial court finds that a child is delinquent or in need of supervision, it may enter a disposition that: 1) permits the child to stay with his or her parents subject to conditions set by the court for the rehabilitation of the juvenile, pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(a)(1); 2) place the child under protective supervision, pursuant to \u00a7 16-2320(a)(2); 3) place the child in a private organization or facility that is authorized to care for the child, pursuant to \u00a7 16-2320(a)(3)(B); 4) place the child in the care of relatives, pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(a)(3)(C); 5) commit the child to an appropriate facility for medical, psychiatric, or other treatment, pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(a)(4); 6) \u201ctransfer ... legal custody to a public agency for the care of delinquent children,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(c)(2); and 7) place the child on probation, pursuant to \u00a7 16-2320(c)(3). Although the authority to make certain dispositions is similar in delinquency and neglect cases, a judge in a neglect proceeding has broader authority than a judge in a delinquency proceeding because \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(a)(5), permits a judge in a neglect case to \u201cmake such other dispositions ... as the [court] deems to be in the best interest of the child [and to] order any public agency of the District of Columbia to provide any service the [court] determines is needed.\u201d There is no analogous provision applicable to delinquency cases.\nIn paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 the trial court is directing either the placement or the treatment of P.S. The District argues that Family Court judges handling delinquency matters no longer have authority to make placement and treatment decisions after custody of the delinquent is transferred to the public agency, pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(c)(2). When the legislature amended \u00a7 16-2320 in 1993, \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5), which previously applied to judges in both neglect and delinquency cases, became applicable only to judges in neglect cases. By limiting \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5) to neglect cases, the legislature did two things: 1) it removed the broad authority of the court to make dispositions that are not specifically listed in the statute and 2) it specifically removed the court\u2019s authority to order a public agency to provide specific services in juvenile delinquency cases. Because we recognize that the legislature made a clear distinction between the court\u2019s authority in neglect cases and delinquency cases by expressly limiting the authority of judges in delinquency cases, appellee must prove that the statute specifically gives judges in delinquency cases the authority to make decisions for the placement and treatment of juveniles when the child has been transferred to the custody of an agency, such as DHS. Appellee contends that: 1) despite the 1993 amendments Family Court judges in delinquency matters retain broad authority to make dispositions that are in the best interest of the child and 2) that, in any event, the statute provides trial judges in delinquency cases with specifically granted authority to make placement and treatment decisions.\nAppellee principally relies on pre-1993 cases to support his contention that Family Court judges handling delinquency matters have the general authority to make whatever dispositions are in the best interest of the child. However, as we have already discussed, prior to 1993 judges handling juvenile delinquency cases had the same broad authority to direct the placement and treatment of juveniles as did judges in neglect cases. However, they no longer have that specifically delineated authority. Thus, our decisions prior to 1993 that recognized that the trial court in delinquency matters could exercise such broad authority pursuant to \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5) are no longer applicable to the circumstances presented here.\nAlternatively, appellee argues that Family Court judges handling delinquency matters have specifically granted authority to direct the placement and treatment of juveniles in delinquency cases pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) & 16-2322(a)(4). D.C.Code \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(a)(4) provides that the trial court may order the \u201c[cjommitment of the child for medical, psychiatric or other treatment at an appropriate facility on an in-patient basis if, at the disposi-tional hearing ... the [court] finds that confinement is necessary to the treatment of the child.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2322(a)(4) provides that \u201c[u]nless the order sets a minimum period for commitment of the child, or specifies that release is permitted only by order of the [Family Court], the department, agency, or institution may release the child at any time that it appears the purpose of the disposition order has been achieved.\u201d\nAppellee\u2019s contention that \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) provides statutory authority for trial courts to order a public agency to place a delinquent juvenile in a particular facility is not supported by a plain reading of the statute and is inconsistent with our prior case law. While it is true that a trial judge has the authority to directly commit a child to an appropriate facility for \u201cmedical, psychiatric or other treatment,\u201d nothing in the statute suggests that \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) should be read in conjunction with \u00a7 16-2320(c)(2), which authorizes the court to transfer custody of a delinquent child to a public agency. D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) does not specifically grant trial judges the authority to order a public agency to commit a child for \u201cmedical, psychiatric or other treatment.\u201d Further, in our cases construing \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4), we have previously interpreted this provision as giving trial judges the authority to commit a child directly to a treatment facility. See In re C.W.M., 407 A.2d 617 (D.C.1979) and In re Myrick, 624 A.2d 1222 (D.C.1993). Therefore, there is no basis for interpreting \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) as permitting the court to order a public agency to place a delinquent in a particular facility.\nThis court has referred to the application of \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) in delinquency matters in just two cases, In re C.W.M., and In re Myrick. The issue in In re C.W.M. was whether a juvenile, who was charged with a criminal offense, could plead insanity as a defense. The trial court ruled that a juvenile could not use insanity as a defense, and this court upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling based on the conclusion that the juvenile system adequately protects juveniles with mental illnesses. The court pointed to \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) as an example of the court\u2019s ability to ensure that juveniles who have been found guilty of committing crimes, and who have mental illness, receive treatment. The court stated that \u201c[i]f, after the fact-finding hearing, the child is adjudicated a delinquent and it is determined also that he is mentally ill, the [Family Court] may as provided in D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4), order commitment to an appropriate facility for medical, psychiatric, or other treatment, or direct, pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 2321(b), the appropriate authority to initiate civil commitment proceedings.\u201d C.W.M., 407 A.2d at 624, n. 16. Nothing in C.W.M. suggests that the court was interpreting \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) in conjunction with \u00a7 16\u20142320(c)(2).\nIn In re Myrick, the issue was whether the District of Columbia was obligated to pay for the treatment of a nonresident in a treatment facility outside the District of Columbia if the individual had been previously civilly committed by the District. 624 A.2d at 1223. While the situation in Myrick was unrelated to a delinquent child, the court used the authority of the court to place delinquent juveniles in treatment facilities as an analogy to support its conclusion that the court had the authority to order treatment outside the District under the Ervin Act. The court interpreted \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) as authorizing the court to \u201corder DHS to place a juvenile delinquent in a specific program outside the District of Columbia.\u201d Id. at 1229. However, the issue in Myrick is not the jurisdiction of the court under \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4), since this case is not related to either a criminal matter or a juvenile case, and while the court mentions the application of \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) in dicta, it is not precedent for the present case. Therefore, neither of the above mentioned cases convinces this court that \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) should be read in conjunction with \u00a7 16-2320(c)(2), and because the trial court committed P.S. to DHS as opposed to committing him directly to a treatment facility, \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4) is inapplicable to the present case.\nAs for D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2322(a)(4), this provision gives the trial court the authority to decide whether a juvenile, who has been adjudicated delinquent, may be released from the custody of a public agency, such as DHS, if the court retains this authority in the commitment order. The purpose of this statute is to give trial judges input into deciding when the child should be released into the community. See In re C.L.M., 766 A.2d 992, 996 (D.C.2001). Appellee contends, however, that some of the additional powers the judge retained in the supplemental order in this case \u201cmerely reflect the trial court\u2019s reservation of\u2019 this veto power. For instance, appellee states in his brief that:\n[a] judge\u2019s retention of \u201cveto power\u201d over release brings with it the right to review the juvenile\u2019s progress, and the agency\u2019s plans, at the time that release is proposed. Thus, the trial court did nothing radical, or beyond the scope of her authority, when she stated in paragraph 6 of the Supplemental Disposition Order: \u201cThis court reserves jurisdiction over this matter to, inter alia, review and approve of any therapeutic residential treatment facility, transitional and or independent living program, or other placement for the Respondent. The Respondent may not be placed in any therapeutic residential treatment facility, transitional and or independent living program, or other location without the prior approval of this Court.\u201d\nNothing in D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2322(a)(4), however supports the broad authority reserved by the judge in paragraph 6 to veto transfer of a committed youth from one facility to another. Under this statute, Family Court judges handling delinquency matters may only retain veto power over a decision made by DHS to release the juvenile back to the community.\nWhile the trial judge still has the responsibility of crafting a disposition that is in the best interest of the child, the trial court must act within the constraints of the legal authority conferred by the statute, and the statute no longer confers upon the judge the authority to make placement and treatment decisions for delinquent juveniles, who have been committed to a public agency. For the foregoing reasons, paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 contain provisions that are beyond the statutory authority of a juvenile court judge, and we remand the case to the trial court to revise the order in a manner consistent with this opinion.\nSo ordered.\n.The District did not object during the disposition hearing to the provisions of the trial court order, and it is a fundamental principle of normal appellant review that matters not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. However, representations have been made that there are over thirty pending cases invoking judicial orders similar to the one complained of in this \"lead case\u201d now before us and that the trial court has been apprised of and rejected the District\u2019s contentions. We therefore deem this to be an \"exceptional situation\u201d in which we will deviate from the usual rule. See District of Columbia v. Helen Dwight Reid Educ. Found., 766 A.2d 28, 33, n. 3 (D.C.2001); see also Bell v. United States, 806 A.2d 228, 232 (D.C.2002).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2801 (2001).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3215 (2001).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3232 (2001).\n. P.S. was age seventeen at that time.\n. The District also contends that the trial court erred by giving DHS a goal, preparing P.S. for independent living, that differs from the agency's stated goal of rehabilitation. While the District is correct that rehabilitation is the goal for a public agency in delinquency cases, this court will not address this issue because the trial court did not direct DHS to perform any action pursuant to this goal.\n. Appellees also rely on \u00a7 16-2320(c) that states that Family Court judges handling delinquency matters \"may make any of the following dispositions which will be in the best interest of the child.\u201d Under this provision, the court\u2019s authority to act in the best interest of the child, however, is limited by the dispositions that are listed in the subsections of \u00a7 16-2320(c), as opposed to the broad authority that applies to \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5).\n. In In re J.J., 431 A.2d 587 (D.C.1981), this court held that \u201cthe designation of a particular placement in a commitment order is within the judicial function, as defined by statute. D.C.Code 1978 Supp., \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5)(i)\u201d, id. at 591 at n. 9, and \"[a]s long as provision of the particular services is within the agency\u2019s legal authority, the Family [Court] may, by virtue of D.C.Code 1978 Supp., \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5)(i), order the agency to provide those services in its initial disposition order.\u201d Id. at 591. In In re J.A.G., 443 A.2d 13 (D.C.1982) this court held that \u2018\u2018[w]hen the trial court committed J.A.G. to the custody of DHS, on June 8, 1979, it specifically ordered that J.A.G. be placed at Highland Hospital. In doing so, the court properly acted within its scope of authority; the Family [Court] of the Superior Court does have the power to designate a particular placement as a part of its initial disposition order. See D.C.Code 1973, \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(c)(1); D.C.Code 1978 Supp., \u00a7 16-2320(a)(5); In re J.J., 431 A.2d 587, 591 (D.D.App.1981).\u201d Id. at 15.\n.The Myrick court cites to In re A.A.I., 483 A.2d 1205, 1209 (D.C.1984), In re J.A.G., 443 A.2d 13, 15 (D.C.1982), and In re C.W.M., 407 A.2d 617, 624 n. 16 (D.C.1979). However, none of these cases support this interpretation of \u00a7 16-2320(a)(4).\n. In this case, the court did retain this veto authority.\n. Additionally, this court addressed the authority the court has to make decisions for the rehabilitation of the child after commitment in In re J.M.W., 411 A.2d 345, 349 (D.C.1980) and In re J.A.G., 443 A.2d at 16. In J.M.W., this court held that \"while the court is specifically granted authority to modify or revoke a dispositional order placing a juvenile on probation, the court is without statutory power to intervene after commitment.\u201d Id. at 348; see also In re J.A.G. 443 A.2d at 16 (\"once a juvenile is committed to the custody of DHS, the Family [Court] 'relinquishe[s] its authority to determine the appropriate measures needed to insure rehabilitation.\u201d \u2019) (quoting In re J.M.W. 411 A.2d at 349); see also In re C.L.M., 766 A.2d 992, 997 (D.C.2001); In re A.A.I., 483 A.2d 1205, 1208 (D.C.1984). Even though the trial judges in the above mentioned cases attempted to make decisions for a juvenile who had been adjudicated delinquent after the commitment to an agency, whereas in this case the court attempted to issue a supplemental order, in which it retained jurisdiction within the commitment order, the same principle applies in this case as articulated in J.M.W. and J.A.G. that upon commitment to an administrative agency, the court relinquishes authority to make all decisions pertaining to the child\u2019s rehabilitation.\n. We do not mean to suggest by this opinion that the trial court has no authority to direct and supervise a juvenile's treatment regimen. Under \u00a7 16 \u2014 2320(c)(3), the trial court always has the option of placing a child on probation if it believes that probation is in the best interest of the child and the community. If a child is placed on probation, the court may ensure through its probationary authority that the child receives the treatment the court deems is necessary.",
