        "text": "PRYOR, Senior Judge:\nThis consolidated appeal follows a bench trial interpreting a Partnership Agreement and Guaranty between appellants and the appellee. Appellants in No. 97-CV-1691, collectively referred to as the \u201cGuarantors,\u201d allege trial court error interpreting then-guaranty agreement with appellee and awarding attorney\u2019s fees in addition to damages. Appellants in No. 97-CV-1692, collectively referred to as \u201cJBG,\u201d \u201cJBG Partnership,\u201d or \u201cPartnership,\u201d allege trial court error interpreting their partnership agreement with appellee and awarding attorneys fees beyond the agreement\u2019s contracted maximum liability of $10 million. We affirm the court\u2019s interpretation of the guaranty and partnership agreement, with the exception of the award of attorneys fees against JBG, which we vacate.\nI.\nAppellants and the appellee, Union Station Venture Corporation No. P-5, entered a joint venture agreement to develop the former Woodward & Lothrop warehouse near Union Station (the \u201cVenture\u201d). Union Station Venture Corporation, hereinafter \u201cOHIO,\u201d is a District of Columbia corporation owned by the pension fund for Ohio State\u2019s mox-e than 300,000 public employees. On June 9, 1989, the parties memorialized the terms of their venture in a Partnership Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). Among other things, the Agreement provided that OHIO was to contribute $65 million, receive a sixty percent interest in the Venture, and earn a ten percent monthly return on its investment. The JBG Partnership invested $10, secured a $750,000 managing contract, and obtained a forty percent interest in the Venture. The Agreement further provided that in certain circumstances, JBG would be hable to OHIO for losses it incurred, up to a maximum of $10 million. A separate guaranty agreement (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d) was also executed holding JBG\u2019s individual investors, the Guarantors, personally accountable for certain JBG obligations.\nIn 1998, after a change in the District\u2019s real estate market, JBG stopped paying OHIO\u2019S ten percent monthly return. Additionally, OHIO\u2019S \u201cCapital Account,\u201d which kept track of its Venture finances, revealed a deficit approaching $30 million. In light of these unfavorable factors, on May 12, 1993, OHIO elected to terminate the Venture pursuant to \u00b621 of the Agreement \u2014 the interpretation of which is now at the center of this appeal.\nParagraph 21 contains a buy/sell provision which, once executed, dissolves the Venture. Under its terms, an offering party sets a \u201cventure price\u201d that when applied to a formula set forth in the Agreement, yields two figures; the \u201cofferor\u2019s net venture price\u201d and the \u201cofferee\u2019s net venture price.\u201d These figures, as determined by the Agreement\u2019s formula, represent the amount the buying party must pay for the seller\u2019s interest in the Venture. The non-offering party then has ninety days to elect to either buy the offeror\u2019s Venture interest (for the offeror\u2019s net venture price), or sell its own (for the offeree\u2019s net venture price). If no election is made within the ninety-day period, the right to select reverts to the offeror. Paragraph 21(D) also states, in part, that: \u201c[JBG] understands and agrees that, under certain circumstances, the Net Venture Price applicable to [JBG] may be less than zero (0) and require a reimbursement from [JBG], as seller, to OHIO, as buyer.\u201d\nAs the offering party, OHIO\u2019S May 12, 1993 notice to JBG set $40.9 million as the venture price. The parties agree that as the buyer, JBG owed OHIO the offeror\u2019s net venture price plus, pursuant to the above quoted language in \u00b6 21(D), approximately $8 .5 million to replenish the deficit in OHIO\u2019S Capital Account. The parties further agree that as the seller, JBG\u2019s net venture price for its interest in the Venture was zero ($0.). A disagreement arose, however, over whether JBG, as the seller, was still liable under the above quoted language of \u00b6 21(D) for the $8.5 million reimbursement of OHIO\u2019S Capital Account. Ninety days after OHIO\u2019S May 12th notice, JBG made no election to buy or sell. OHIO, therefore, elected to purchase JBG\u2019s interest and set October 12, 1993 as the closing date. At closing, JBG transferred its Venture interest to OHIO, but refused to pay the $8.5 million reimbursement. According to JBG, its \u201creimbursement\u201d obligation as a seller under \u00b6 21(D) was \u201coblique and indefinite\u201d and, therefore, it had no duty to replenish OHIO\u2019S Capital Account. Litigation ensued.\nA seven-day bench trial commenced in Superior Court; voluminous documentary evidence and witness testimony were admitted, and extensive post-trial briefs were submitted by the parties. At issue was not only the correct interpretation of JBG\u2019s reimbursement obligation as the seller, but also whether the Guarantors were liable under the Guaranty agreement for JBG\u2019s reimbursement liability, if any. On March 11, 1997, a twenty-one page Memorandum, Opinion and Order was issued by the court. The court concluded that JBG, as the seller, was liable under \u00b6 21(D) for the reimbursement, and that the Guarantors were personally liable under the Guaranty as well. Accordingly, the court awarded OHIO $8,513,006 .94 in damages. See note 1, supra. Following additional briefing by the parties, on June 18, 1997, the court awarded OHIO an additional $1,928,066.40 in attorney\u2019s fees under \u00b6 30(D) of the Agreement and Section 2(h) of the Guaranty. JBG and the Guarantors appealed.\nOn appeal, JBG contends the trial court incorrectly interpreted \u00b6 21(D) of the Agreement as creating an enforceable obligation to reimburse OHIO\u2019S Capital Account where it was the seller in a buy/sell. JBG also argues the award of attorney\u2019s fees above and beyond its maximum $10 million in contractual liability was erroneous. Similarly, the Guarantors contest the trial court\u2019s imposition of liability for JBG\u2019s reimbursement under the Guaranty, as well as the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\nII.\nInterpreting the Agreement\nWhere a contract\u2019s language is \u201cclear and definite,\u201d we adhere to the \u201cobjective law\u201d of contracts, Minmar Builders, Inc. v. Beltway Excavators, Inc., 246 A.2d 784, 786 (D.C.1968), and interpret the contract as a matter of law. 1901 Wyoming Ave. Coop. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 345 A.2d 456, 461 n. 8 (D.C. 1975).\nConversely, an \u201cobjective interpretation\u201d of an ambiguous contract may require evidence of the parties\u2019 intent regarding the meaning of term(s), thus presenting a question of fact. Howard Univ. v. Best, 484 A.2d 958, 966-67 (D.C.1984) (citations omitted). This factual determination takes into account how a \u201creasonable person\u201d in the parties\u2019 position would interpret the ambiguous language. Id. at 967 n. 2 (citations omitted). The court may consider extrinsic evidence (either explicitly or implicitly) in its analysis. Waverly Taylor, Inc. v. Polinger, 583 A.2d 179, 182 (D.C.1990) (citation omitted).\nOn appeal, we review de novo the question of whether a contract is ambiguous. Sacks v. Rothberg, 569 A.2d 150, 155 (D.C.1990) (citing Dodek v. CF 16 Corp., 537 A.2d 1086 (D.C.1988)). We do so because it is a question of law. If we deem a contract provision ambiguous, our review becomes limited and we reverse only if the court\u2019s interpretation is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Waverly Taylor, Inc., supra, 583 A.2d at 182 (citing D.C.Code \u00a7 17-305(a) (1989)).\nIn the instant case, we review de novo whether \u00b6 21(D) is ambiguous from \u201cthe language itself, giving that language its plain meaning, without reference to any rules of construction.\u201d Sacks, supra, 569 A.2d at 154 (citing Kass v. William Norwitz Co., 509 F.Supp. 618, 625 (D.D.C.1980)). The relevant language states: \u201c[JBG] understands and agrees that, under certain circumstances, the Net Venture Price applicable to [JBG] may be less than zero (0) and require a reimbursement from [JBG], as seller, to OHIO, as buyer.\u201d As JBG contends, the meaning of \u201creimbursement\u201d and the circumstances that trigger it are neither clear nor definite. Stated otherwise, the reimbursement provision is ambiguous. Having so concluded, we turn now to review the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00b6 21(D)\u2019s reimbursement provision under the \u201cplainly wrong\u201d standard. Waverly, supra, 583 A.2d at 182.\nTo interpret \u00b6 21(D), the trial court focused on the parties\u2019 intent as demonstrated by their negotiating history. Specifically, the court considered a December 13, 1988 letter from JBG and concluded that the document \u201ccategorically disposes of any notion that JBG did not understand that [OHIO] was proposing that in a buy/sell, if JBG was the seller, it might be obligated to repay [OHIO\u2019s] capital accounts to the $10 million limit.\u201d From there, the court reviewed documents and witness testimony regarding the negotiations, and concluded that JBG had \u201cattempted to negotiate such a potential liability out of the Agreement, but failed to do so .\u201d The court thus concluded, \u201c[t]he signed Agreement imposes [ ] liability upon [JBG].\u201d\nReviewing the documentary and testimonial evidence presented to the trial court, we find ample evidence supporting the court\u2019s decision that the parties intended JBG would be liable for reimbursement \u2014 even as the seller in a buy/sell. JBG\u2019s primary contentions, that \u00b6 21(D) is unenforceable as a matter of law because it is \u201coblique and indefinite,\u201d and that \u00b6 21(D) is \u201cat war\u201d with the other provisions in the agreement, are unpersuasive. As stated supra, the trial court may properly consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 negotiating history to reach an objective interpretation of an ambiguous provision\u2019s meaning. Waverly Taylor, Inc., supra, 583 A.2d at 182; Howard Univ., supra, 484 A.2d at 966-67. The judge could rationally find that a reasonable person in the parties\u2019 position at signing would have understood \u00b6 21(D) to impose liability upon JBG as the seller in a buy/sell arrangement. See id. at 967 n. 2. Accordingly, there being ample evidence supporting the court\u2019s conclusion in the record \u2014 certainly more than necessary to uphold under the \u201cplainly wrong\u201d standard\u2014 we affirm the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00b6 21(D) and the imposition of reimbursement liability upon JBG.\nIII.\nInterpreting the Guaranty\nLike JBG, the Guarantors argue we should review de novo the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the Guaranty. As discussed supra, we first review de novo whether the Guaranty agreement was ambiguous and, if we conclude it is, our review of the trial court\u2019s conclusion is limited. Waverly Taylor, Inc., supra, 583 A.2d at 182; Sacks, supra, 569 A.2d at 154.\nThe first page of the Guaranty contains a lengthy definition of the Guarantors \u201cobligations.\u201d Whether JBG\u2019s liability under \u00b6 21(D) is a guaranteed \u201cobligation\u201d under the terms of the Guaranty is disputed. The Guarantors contend the plain language of the Guaranty itself demonstrates no such liability. The appellee, however, argues persuasively that \u00b6 21(D) cannot logically be excluded from the Guarantor\u2019s obligations because it is explicitly referenced within the controlling definition. We agree. Reviewing the Guaranty de novo for ambiguity, we find the question of whether the Guarantors\u2019 obligation included the \u00b6 21(D) reimbursement to be unclear. Thus, the Guaranty\u2019s definition is ambiguous, and again we must consider whether the court\u2019s interpretation was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d\nReturning to the parties\u2019 negotiating history, we find ample evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that the parties intended the Guaranty to cover \u00b6 21(D). The Guarantor\u2019s prior attorney even admitted in deposition that if JBG was liable for $10 million as the seller in a buy/sell (as is the ease), \u201cthen there would be personal liability by the individual guarantor[s] under the guaranty\u201d as well. As summarized by the court \u201c[i]n the end ... [the Guarantors] were forced to accept the risk involved because it became apparent that for Ohio failure to obtain $10 million downside protection, and to have that protection individually guaranteed, was a de-albreaker.\u201d Finding sufficient evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guaranty, we affirm.\nIY.\nAttorney\u2019s Fees\nTurning finally to attorney\u2019s fees,' we are faced with clear and precise language in two separate contracts (the Partnership Agreement and the Guaranty) which, at first glance, appears to conflict. The relevant contract language is as follows.\nParagraph 30(D) of the Partnership Agreement provides \u201cexcept as otherwise provided herein\u201d the prevailing party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Paragraph 30(P) of the Agreement, however, provides \u201cNotwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,\u201d JBG\u2019s liability is capped at $10 million. Thus, under the most reasonable reading of the Agreement, JBG\u2019s liability \u2014 including any award of attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 is limited to $10 million.\nThe issue is complicated, however, by conflicting language in the Guaranty. Section 2(h) of the Guaranty provides that any award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Guaranty are recoverable \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d Thus, under the clear and unambiguous language of the Guaranty, the Guarantors\u2019 liability for attorney\u2019s fees is not limited.\nAppellants argue, both before the trial court and on appeal, that \u00b630^)\u20198 express cap on liability \u2014 including attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 is controlling. Appellee relies upon the language in the Guaranty to support its argument for fees in excess of the $10 million reimbursement provision. The trial court, finding the Agreement and Guaranty to be \u201ccoextensive,\u201d concluded that attorney\u2019s fees are generally above and beyond any award of damages and, relying on the Guaranty\u2019s language, awarded fees in addition to the $8.5 million reimbursement obligation.\nBecause we find the relevant contract language susceptible to only one meaning, our review is not limited. Howard Univ., supra, 484 A.2d at 966-67. We observe that while the Agreement is between OHIO and JBG, the Guaranty is between OHIO and the Guarantors. Thus, from the clear and unambiguous language of both contracts, any award of attorney\u2019s fees against JBG is limited to $10 million pursuant to the Agreement, but, pursuant to the Guaranty, any award of attorney\u2019s fees against the Guarantors is \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d Accordingly, we vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees against JBG to the extent it makes the full award against the partnership exceed $10 million and affirm the award of fees in the full amount against the Guarantors. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed in all respects except that the award of attorney\u2019s fees against JBG Partnership is vacated.\nSo ordered.\n. JBG\u2019s actual liability was calculated as its maximum contractual obligation for OHIO\u2019S loss, $10 million, less $1,486,993 .04 already paid, for a net liability of $8,513,006.94.\n. In their brief, the Guarantors argue that the court\u2019s reliance on this testimony was erroneous since their attorney also testified 1121(D) did not impose reimbursement liability upon JBG as a seller in a buy/sell. To the contrary, having found \u00b6 21(D) did apply to JBG, the admission by appellant\u2019s former counsel that if this was the court\u2019s holding, then the imposition of liability against the Guarantors must follow, was all the more valuable.",

        "text": "SCHWELB, Associate Judge,\nconcurring:\nI join the judgment and opinion of the court. I add a few words, however, regarding the question whether the cap in the Agreement on JBG\u2019s liability applies to counsel fees.\nParagraph 31(P) of the Agreement provides that \u201cNotwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein subjects PARTNER to personal liability to OHIO in excess of ... TEN MILLION DOLLARS less [certain cash contributions by PARTNER].\u201d The language of this paragraph, as the court points out, is unqualified.\nThe trial judge was fully aware of this provision. He concluded, however, that\nthe cap contained in the Agreement relates specifically to the requirements of the Agreement itself and not to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Typically, an attorneys\u2019 fees provision would not be included in any calculation of amounts owed under a contract. If the attorneys\u2019 fees were meant to be limited in any manner, the parties would have so stated in the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of the Agreement and the Guaranty.\nIn my opinion, the judge\u2019s view is not at all unreasonable. The parties have cited no authority, however, and I am aware of none, to support the proposition that an otherwise absolute cap should be construed as excluding counsel fees. No testimony was offered as to the practice in the business community or as to any negotiations relating to paragraph 31(P). I find the issue to be a very close one, but I am not prepared to say that my colleagues are wrong in their reading of the Agreement as a whole.",
