        "text": "OPINION\nLEDERBERG, Justice.\nRichard L. Brigham, Jr. (defendant) appealed to the Supreme Court from a judgment of conviction on two counts of first-degree sexual assault. The defendant was sentenced to thirty years on each count, to be served concurrently. On direct appeal the defendant challenged the admission of the testimony of the victim\u2019s sister under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and also contested the legality of the sentence imposed. We affirm the conviction. A brief recitation of the pertinent facts follows.\nAnn Ames, aged twenty-one at the time of trial, testified that she had endured sexual assaults by defendant, her stepfather, for approximately six years from the time she was ten or eleven years old until 1986, when she was sixteen years old. In 1986 Ann\u2019s mother learned about the assaults, and confronted her husband with the allegations. The defendant admitted the offenses. The three family members had a meeting at which Ann agreed to work things out rather than subject her mother to a divorce. According to Ann\u2019s testimony, at this 1986 meeting defendant apologized to her and assured her that he would never assault her again and did not. After staying with a friend for about a week, she moved back with her mother and stepfather in the hope that she could achieve a normal life. Ann did not report the abuse in 1986, but did so in November 1989 in a report to the Smithfield police.\nAfter investigation, defendant was indicted on March 2, 1990, on five counts relating to the sexual assault of his two stepdaughters, Ann and Betty Ames. After trial commenced, the trial justice entered judgment of acquittal on two counts relating to defendant\u2019s conduct towards Betty and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island (state) dismissed the charge alleging abominable and detestable crimes against nature upon Ann. At the conclusion of all the evidence the jury returned a guilty verdict on the remaining two counts relating to first-degree sexual assault upon Ann. After a two-day sentencing hearing, the trial justice sentenced defendant to thirty years on each count of first-degree sexual assault, the terms to be served concurrently. The defendant filed a timely appeal, raising two issues.\nThe defendant challenged the admission of Betty Ames\u2019s testimony into evidence. During trial, the state conceded that charges against defendant for his abuse of Betty were barred by the statute of limitations. Nevertheless, at trial Betty testified to a three-year history of sexual abuse similar to that experienced by her older sister, Ann. According to defendant, Betty\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of her was inadmissible under Rule 404(b) because the testimony amounted to evidence of prior misconduct or \u201cother bad acts.\u201d The trial justice, however, admitted Betty\u2019s testimony under Rule 404(b), determining that her testimony was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to establish the elements of the state\u2019s prima facie case against defendant. We agree.\nAs a general rule, in the prosecution of a specific crime, evidence of past, unconnected, uncharged criminal behavior is not admissible to prove a defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crime charged. State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1193 (R.I.1988). The basis for excluding such evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d is the belief that \u201c \u2018the potential for creating prejudice in the minds of the jurors outweighs its probative value.\u2019 \u201d State v. Brown, 626 A.2d 228, 238 (R.I.1993). However, the probative value has been found to outweigh the prejudicial effect when the evidence of other bad acts is introduced to establish \u201c \u2018guilty knowledge, intent, motive, design, plan, scheme, system, or the like.\u2019\u201d State v. Tobin, 602 A.2d 528, 531 (R.I.1992).\nIn State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 382 A.2d 526 (1978), this court considered the use of evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d in cases involving sexual offenses. In Jalette we held for the first time that evidence of other, not too remote, sexual offenses committed against the victim of the crime charged or with persons other than the victim may be admitted if the evidence is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d and not merely cumulative. Id. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533. Accord State v. Messa, 542 A.2d 1071 (R.I.1988). Subsequently, in State v. Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176 (R.I.1983), we were confronted for the first time with the admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s similar sexual conduct with young children living in the same household where such similar sexual conduct was not named in the indictment. In Pignolet we held that evidence of such sexual conduct is admissible under Rule 404(b) if the trial court finds the uncharged conduct is \u201cclosely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts\u201d and is relevant, material and highly probative of the defendant\u2019s lecherous conduct toward the children over whom the defendant exercised control, supervision and discipline. Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 181-82. Accord State v. Cardoza, 465 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I.1983). Admission of this testimony, however, is not indiscriminate. As we noted in Jalette and Pignolet, in addition to establishing a close relationship between the evidence of other bad acts and the crime charged, the state must establish that such evidence is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the state to meet its burden of proof. Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182; Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533. Furthermore, the trial justice must instruct the jury as to the proper use of the offered testimony. 119 R.I. at 627-28, 382 A.2d at 533-34.\nIn the case before us, defendant did not allege that Betty\u2019s testimony was not closely related to the acts charged against defendant. The defendant also candidly admitted that the limiting instruction given by the trial justice was appropriate. The defendant alleged, however, that the state had failed to establish that Betty\u2019s testimony was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to prove a prima fa-cie ease against defendant.\nIn ruling the evidence admissible, the trial justice found the testimony probative of two outstanding issues underlying both counts of first-degree sexual-assault charges. As to count 1, the trial justice, while recognizing its limited relevance, found Betty\u2019s testimony probative of a plan or scheme by defendant to assault his stepdaughters prior to their thirteenth birthdays. More importantly, the trial justice found Betty\u2019s testimony highly relevant in regard to count 2 and the issue of psychological coercion.\nAccording to defendant, it was erroneous for the trial justice to admit this testimony because, unlike the \u201crun-of-the-mill child molestation case\u201d where the testimony may be reasonably necessary, it was not necessary in the instant case in which defendant actually admitted that sexual acts took place. In addition, defendant attacked the trial justice\u2019s determination that the testimony was highly relevant on the issue of psychological coercion. According to defendant, Ann\u2019s own testimony regarding an escalating course of sexual conduct spanning several years was sufficient to prove psychological coercion. Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, Betty\u2019s testimony was not necessary to prove the prima facie case but was merely cumulative. We disagree.\nThe defendant was charged under G.L.1956 (1981 Reenactment) \u00a7 11-37-2, as amended by P.L.1981, ch. 119, \u00a7 1, with engaging in sexual penetration with another person using \u201cforce or coercion.\u201d During opening statements, defense counsel in effect promoted a defense of consent by explicitly directing the jury to pay attention, inter alia, to the state\u2019s proof regarding defendant\u2019s coercion of Ann. Thus, because defendant raised the defense of consent, \u201cit becomes part of the state\u2019s burden to negate consent in order to prove that the sexual assault was committed with force or coercion.\u201d State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 13 (R.I.1993). \u201cIn any prosecution * * * the state must establish that the defendant committed the act that constitutes the crime.\u201d State v. Pule, 453 A.2d 1095, 1098 (R.I.1982). Thus, \u201cregardless of \u2018how conclusive the evidence on any essential element of the offense may appear, the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury precludes a court from assuming that such fact has been proved.\u2019 \u201d Id.\nThe state\u2019s theory in the instant case was that defendant used his position as disciplinarian and head of the household to psychologically coerce Ann into the sexual acts. Betty\u2019s testimony, in addition to detailing incidents of abuse similar to that experienced by her sister, described defendant\u2019s relationship with his stepdaughters and verified defendant\u2019s position as disciplinarian and head of the household. For example, Betty testified that defendant began to assert his interest in her when she turned to him for assistance with her homework. In addition, Betty identified defendant as being primarily in charge of disciplining her and her sister as they were growing up. Betty also described how her fear of her stepfather led her to believe she had no choice but to comply with his advances. Betty\u2019s testimony therefore was highly relevant and probative of the degree of control, supervision, and discipline defendant exercised over his stepdaughters, see Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 181-82, but was the testimony \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to prove the state\u2019s prima facie case? See Tobin, 602 A.2d at 532.\nIn determining whether evidence is necessary to establish the state\u2019s prima facie case, \u201cthe test we must apply is what appeared to be reasonably necessary to the trial justice at the time [the testimony is offered].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182. At the time the trial justice admitted Betty\u2019s testimony, the burden was on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used force or coercion to commit the assaults. Beyond representations by defense counsel during a side-bar conference that defendant might not be testifying, defendant gave no indication of what evidence, if any, would be introduced to counter a claim of psychological coercion. At that point, Ann\u2019s testimony was the sole source establishing coercion, and her testimony was impeached in part by her admission that she resented defendant for marrying her mother. Betty\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, affirmed defendant\u2019s position of authority and revealed that, prior to her mother\u2019s marrying defendant, she loved defendant and thought \u201che was the greatest thing in the world.\u201d Given these factors, it was not erroneous for the trial justice to conclude that Betty\u2019s testimony was reasonably necessary to establish that defendant used psychological coercion in sexually assaulting Ann. Therefore, coupled with the proper limiting instruction, Betty\u2019s testimony was properly admitted under Rule 404(b). See Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182.\nWe now turn to defendant\u2019s contention that the trial justice committed prejudicial error in imposing the thirty-year sentences. On direct appeal, defendant alleges that the sentence he received was unlawful because the trial justice considered improper criteria in imposing the sentence. In particular, according to defendant, his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, as well as his right to due process, were violated when the trial justice considered, inter alia, defendant\u2019s decision to stand trial as a factor in determining defendant\u2019s level of remorse for his crimes.\nIt is well settled that, in the absence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d this court will not consider the legality or propriety of a sentence on direct appeal. State v. Trepanier, 600 A.2d 1311, 1315 (R.I.1991). Rather, \u201c[t]his court has unequivocally held that the appropriate procedure * * * is to seek revision of the sentence in Superior Court pursuant to Rule 35\u201d of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. State v. Baptista, 632 A.2d 343, 345 (R.I.1993). In the instant case, the defendant did not file a Rule 35 motion, seeking correction of sentence in Superior Court. Thus, because the issue raised does not amount to an extraordinary circumstance, the absence of a determination pursuant to a Rule 35 motion precludes this court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence. The statutory 120-day period in which to seek Superi- or Court review of the sentence commences on the date of this opinion should the defendant choose to file such a motion. 632 A.2d at 345.\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated herein, the defendant\u2019s appeal with regard to his judgment of conviction is denied and dismissed and the judgment of conviction is affirmed. The defendant\u2019s appeal from his sentence is denied without prejudice.\n. This is a fictitious name.\n. This is a fictitious name.\n. Count 1 charged defendant with \"sexual penetration, to wit, digital penetration, with [Ann Ames], a person under the age of thirteen * * in violation of [G.L.1956 (1981 Reenactment)] \u00a7 11-37-2 [as amended by P.L.1981, ch. 119, \u00a7 1].\u201d During opening statements, defense counsel admitted to the jury that defendant had sexual contact with Ann in the form of digital penetration but denied that this contact occurred prior to Ann\u2019s thirteenth birthday.\nBetty, in testimony similar to Ann\u2019s, alleged that defendant first touched her when she was ten or eleven years old. Therefore, the trial justice reasoned that Betty's testimony was probative of whether defendant assaulted Ann prior to her thirteenth birthday as alleged in count 1 of the indictment.",
