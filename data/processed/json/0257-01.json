        "text": "KRAMER, Associate Judge:\nAppellant, the father of the minor child A.R., challenges the decision of the trial court awarding custody of A.R. to his maternal aunt, C.N., arguing that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear a motion for custody brought by a non-parent, that it failed to apply the presumption in favor of parental custody, and that it made no finding that he was unfit to parent his son. We remand for a rehearing on the question of custody in which the provisions of the subsequently enacted Safe and Stable Homes for Children and Youth Amendment Act, see D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-831.01-13 (2008 Supp.), shall be applied.\nI. Jurisdiction\nIn the original proceeding addressing C.N.\u2019s complaint for custody, the trial court based its jurisdiction on D.C.Code \u00a7 11-1101(4) (2001), providing, in pertinent part, that the Family Court \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction of actions seeking custody of minor children.\u201d The basis for the court\u2019s decision to award custody to the maternal aunt was set out by the trial court in a carefully written twenty-page order dated March 7, 2005, in which the court took into account a number of factors that must be considered in making a child custody decision in the context of a divorce proceeding, which the court appears to have viewed as analogous. See D.C.Code \u00a7 16-914(a)(3) (2001). We have previously held, however, that D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 11-1101(4) and 16-914(a)(3) \u201ccontemplate an award of custody only as between parents who are parties to [a] divorce proceeding.\u201d T.S. v. M.C.S., 747 A.2d 159, 163 (D.C.2000). See also W.D. v.C.S.M., 906 A.2d 317, 318 (D.C.2006) (\u201c[T]he trial court exceeded its authority in awarding permanent custody of [a] child to unrelated third parties in [a] domestic relations case.\u201d) Accordingly, when the trial court issued its March 7, 2005, order, there was no statutory provision in effect that gave it jurisdiction to hear C.N.\u2019s complaint for custody.\nIn response to what the Council of the District of Columbia viewed as the \u201csubstantial uncertainty\u201d created by W.D. v.C.S.M. about whether \u201cpersons other than parents [could] seek custody of a child when in the child\u2019s best interest,\u201d the Council enacted the Safe and Stable Homes for Children and Youth Amendment Act of 2007, which became effective on September 20, 2007: See D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-831.01-.13 (2008 Supp.). This Act established a \u201crebuttable presumption ... that custody with the parent is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d Id. \u00a7 16-831.05(a). Nonetheless, it also gave standing to file a custody action to a third party \u201cwith whom a child has established a strong emotional tie\u201d and \u201cwho has assumed parental responsibilities.\u201d Council Report at 4. It chose the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard for determining whether custody to a third party should be awarded. See D.C.Code \u00a7 16-831.05, -831.08 (2008 Supp.).\nThe Act did not, however, include language addressing the question of whether this law should be applied retroactively, and we conclude that we need not address that issue either, particularly since we recognize that there is some tension in our case law regarding retroactive application of statutes by an appellate court. At oral argument, both sides agreed that given the lapse of time and the absence of a record informing us of whether the requirements of the D.C.Code \u00a7 16-831.02(a)(l)(2008 Supp.) have been met, we cannot know if A.R. should remain in C.N.\u2019s custody. Accordingly, we must remand this matter for a hearing conducted pursuant to the new statute at which the trial court can determine whether the prerequisites of the statute have been satisfied and whether continued custody with C.N. 'remains in A.R.\u2019s best interest.\nII. CSOSA Document\nK.R. also contends that the trial court erred by not admitting a document from the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency into evidence. The document in question is a Client Status Report from a domestic violence prevention training program in which K.R. participated, detailing his participation, motivation, and overall adjustment as a result of the training. K.R. contends that this document should have been admitted under the public record exception to the hearsay rule. To support this argument, K.R. cites Goldsberry v. United States, 598 A.2d 376 (D.C.1991), which describes the requirements of the public records exception.\nFor hearsay evidence to be admitted as a public record, \u201cthe party proffering the record must prove that the facts stated in the document are within the personal knowledge and observation of the recording official and that the document is prepared pursuant to a duty imposed by law or implied by the nature of the office.\u201d Id. at 378 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In Goldsberry, the hearsay evidence in question consisted of Superior Court docket entries, and the testimony to establish personal knowledge of the documents\u2019 preparation came from a Superior Court employee who served as a calendar coordinator. Id. at 377. The offering witness must be \u201cable to identify the record as authentic and as made in the ordinary course of business.\u201d Id. at 379 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The personal knowledge of the Superior Court calendar coordinator was sufficient because he \u201cidentified the docket entries as official court records and testified that they appeared to have been made in conformity with normal courtroom procedures.\u201d Id. In' this case, K.R. himself served as the offering witness. He had no personal knowledge and could not testify about whether the document was authentic or made in the ordinary course of business. Thus, the trial court properly excluded the evidence as hearsay.\nIII. Conclusion\nThe case is remanded for the trial court to determine whether jurisdiction is proper under D.C.Code \u00a7 16-831.02 (2008 Supp.) and, if so, to make a custody determination consistent with the standards set forth in D.C.Code \u00a7 16-881.01-13 (2008 Supp.).\nSo ordered.\n. We note that unlike the situation in W.D. v.C.S.M., where the persons obtaining custody were not relatives of the child, A.R.'s aunt clearly is a relative, putting her in a somewhat stronger position. Nonetheless, she is not a parent.\n. See Council of the District of Columbia Committee on Human Services, Report on Bill 17-41, The \"Safe and Stable Homes for Children and Youth Act of 2007,\u201d at 1-2 (2007) (hereafter, \"Council Report\u201d).\n. This was limited by the fact that the third party is required to show that at least one of the following conditions is met:\n(A) The parent who is or has been the primary caretaker of the child within the past 3 years consents to the complaint or motion for custody by the third party;\n(B) The party has:\n(i) Lived in the same household as the child for at last 4 of the 6 months immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or motion for custody, or, if the child is under the age of 6 months, for at least half of the child\u2019s live; and\n(ii) Primarily assumed the duties and obligations for which a parent is legally responsible, including the child with food, clothing, shelter, education, financial support, and other care to meet the child's needs; or\n(C)The third party is living with the child and some exceptional circumstance exists such that relief under this chapter is necessary to prevent harm to the child; provided that the complaint or motion shall specify in detail why the relief is necessary to prevent harm to the child.\nD.C.Code \u00a7 16-831.02(a)(1) (2008 Supp.)\n.

Barry, 588 A.2d 1147, 1154 (D.C.1991) (\"[A]n appellate court must \u2018apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Bradley v.
