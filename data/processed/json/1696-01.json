When- it appears that the members of the Court are permanently and evenly divided in opinion as to whether an order should be affirmed or reversed, and there is no prospect of - an immediate change in the personnel of the Court, the order should be affirmed. Therefore it is considered, ordered and adjudged by the Court under the authority of State ex rel. Hampton v. McClung, 47 Fla. 224, 34 So. R. 51, that the order of the circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed.\nTerrell, C. J. and Whitfield, Ellis, Strum, Brown and Buford, J. J., concur.",
