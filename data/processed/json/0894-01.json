        "text": "Letter Opinion\nDear Counsel:\nThis is the Court\u2019s decision on the above-referenced traffic matter. Trial took place on January 8, 2000 and after the receipt of testimony and evidence the Court reserved decision.\nThe relevant facts presented at trial indicated the following. Michael Tussie, the State\u2019s only fact witness, was traveling, northbound on 1-95 on March 5, 1997 around 7:30 a.m. and was involved in a traffic accident with the defendant. He testified he was struck in the rear by the defendant and both parties pulled over to the side of the road. The defendant asked him, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Mr. Tussie testified he thereafter went to the hospital \u201cto get checked out.\u201d The speed limit posted on northbound 1-95 was 55 miles per hour, with four (4) lanes, and Tussie testified that he was in the \u201csecond to the left lane.\u201d He testified traffic stopped and defendant hit him in the rear of his motor vehicle. Tussie also testified the weather conditions were \u201cfair\u201d and that he \u201cdid not believe it was raining.\u201d He testified that at the time of the incident in March, there was \u201cno snow\u201d and the accident occurred in New Castle County.\nOn cross-examination Tussie testified that there were \u201ccars in front\u201d of him and \u201cin back\u201d of him. He testified that he braked because the cars in front of him began to brake. He further testified further he saw defendant\u2019s car in his rear view mirror and at 30 miles per hour, after braking, he was hit by the defendant.\nThe defense presented its case in chief. Mr. Clay testified he was traveling to work at approximately 8:00 a.m. at the I-495/T-95 split. He testified that he saw a motor vehicle backing up near the median at I-495 split and the car in front of him suddenly stopped. He testified that he was travelling 30 miles per hour in the right lane.\nThe defendant is charged in the Information with one count of violating 21 Del.C. \u00a7 4123(a) in that he did:\n... on or about the 5th day of March, 1999, in the County of New Castle, State of Delaware, did drive a motor vehicle upon a public roadway known as 1-95 north bound and did follow another vehicle more closely than reasonable and prudent, failing to have due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.\nThe State has the burden of proving each and every element of these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. 11 Del.C. \u00a7 301. Clearly, the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cdid follow another vehicle more closely than reasonable and prudent\u201d and \u201cfailed to have due regard for the speed of such vehicle and traffic upon and the condition of the highway.\u201d 21 Del.C. \u00a7 4123(a).\nThe Court finds the State has proven the instant charge beyond a reasonable doubt. 11 Del. C. \u00a7 301. The Court bases its decision on the facts outlined in the record. See, Rufus Jones v. State of Delaware, Del.Super., Cr. A. No. N94-08-1659AC, 1995 WL 562128, Silverman, J. (August 23, 1995). The Court, therefore, fines the defendant Fifty Dollars ($50.00) plus 18% to the Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund, One Dollar ($ 1.00) to the Video fee, and Court costs and orders that said fine be paid to the Clerk of Court within 30 days.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nJohn K. Welch,\nAssociate Judge.",
