        "text": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThis case came before a panel of the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 24, 1994, pursuant to an order directing Thomas R. Walek, M.D. (defendant), to show cause why the issues raised in his appeal should not be summarily decided. The defendant appeals from a Superior Court order granting the petition of Frank N. Gustafson & Sons, Inc. (plaintiff), to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien. That order entered judgment in the amount of $51,976.87 plus statutory prejudgment interest in favor of the plaintiff.\nAfter reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and after considering the arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and the issues will be summarily decided.\nThe plaintiff had entered into an agreement with Gate Professional Partners (Gate) for the construction of a condominium project called the Gate Medical Center. Frank N. Gustafson & Sons, Inc. v. Walek, 599 A.2d 730, 731 (R.I.1990). Before plaintiff was paid for its services, the title to medical-office space was transferred by Gate to defendant. Id. This court reversed the Superior Court\u2019s previous dismissal of plaintiffs mechanics\u2019 lien petition and remanded the case to allow plaintiff to comply with procedural requirements. Id. at 733-34. Upon remand, proper citation was issued and served on defendant, thus perfecting the notice requirements of G.L.1956 (1984 Reenactment) \u00a7\u00a7 34-28-14 and 34-28-15. Thereafter, the case proceeded to trial and resulted in a judgment for plaintiff in the amount of the contract price reduced by amounts already paid and amounts disallowed on evidentiary grounds. In this appeal, defendant argued that plaintiff was not entitled to the full contract price because that amount included a profit margin for plaintiff.\nThe defendant also raised several issues on the procedural requirements of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. Specifically, defendant alleged that plaintiff failed to prove that defendant received the Notice of Intention by certified or registered mail, that service of the citation was effectuated on defendant, and that the notice of the petition was made by publication. After reviewing the record, we conclude that defendant\u2019s allegations of procedural deficiencies are without merit. A copy of the Notice of Intention was attached to the petition, the proof of service of the citation was contained in the file, and a copy of the notice by publication was appended to the inner front cover of the Superior Court file.\nIn respect to defendant\u2019s challenge to the enforcement of the mechanics\u2019 lien, we note the relevant statute, \u00a7 34-28-l(a):\n\u201cWhenever any building * * * or other improvement shall be constructed * * * such building * * * is hereby made liable and shall stand subject to liens for all the work done by any person in the construction * * * and for the materials used in the construction * * * which have been furnished by any person.\u201d\nThe defendant maintained that this statute limits plaintiffs recovery only to costs, and contended that profits cannot be subject to a mechanics\u2019 lien. The defendant cited as error the trial justice\u2019s inclusion of a sum representing profit in the judgment that was entered. We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in holding that, under the mechanics\u2019 lien statute, plaintiff was entitled to recover the full contract price, including the amount that represented a profit. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that similarly situated contractors and parties specified in \u00a7 34-28-l(a) would be entitled to the reasonable value of their work, including a profit. \u201cOrdinarily, reasonable value is the cost to the subcontractors of the labor and materials supplied by them, with a fair profit added thereto.\u201d 53 Am.Jur.2d Mechanics\u2019 Liens \u00a7 245 at 766 (1970). In Tilcon Gammino, Inc. v. Commercial Associates, 570 A.2d 1102 (R.I.1990), this court affirmed the enforcement of a mechanics\u2019 lien that sought recovery for labor, equipment, and materials on a cost-plus basis, id. at 1104-05, and in that case we concluded that the amount that was awarded was \u201ccorrect,\u201d \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d id. at 1103, 1106.\nAccordingly, we hold that the contract sum, which included a profit, was reasonable and proper under the mechanics\u2019 lien statute.\nConsequently, we deny and dismiss the appeal. The order appealed from is affirmed, and the papers in the case are remitted to the Superior Court.\nJustice SHEA did not participate.",
