We have previously considered a similar petition, David Wilkins v. Joseph Ponte, Director Wyatt Detention Center, 94-40-M.P., wherein we concluded that this court\u2019s jurisdiction may not be expanded so as to determine the propriety of prisoner transfers authorized by the officials of another state. The same principle is applicable here.\nAccordingly, the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.\nWEISBERGER, Acting C.J., did not participate.",
