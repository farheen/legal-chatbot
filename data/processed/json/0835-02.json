Contrary to LaDew\u2019s contentions, after review of the record in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling, we determine that the record supports the court\u2019s finding of a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel by LaDew, State v. Walls, 501 A.2d 803, 805 (Me.1985), and that the court did not abuse its discretion by revoking LaDew\u2019s probation and ordering that he be incarcerated. 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1206(7-A) (Supp.1987); State v. Oliver, 247 A.2d 122, 123-24 (Me.1968).\nThe entry is: Judgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.",
