The State, however, has filed a confession of error acknowledging that the Superior Court justice in this case erred in failing to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal \u201cin contravention of R.I. General Laws \u00a7 10-9.1-6(b)(2009) and this Court\u2019s postconviction relief doctrine.\u201d After reviewing the record on appeal, we conclude that the confession of error should be accepted. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s appeal is sustained; the Superior Court order denying the application for postconviction relief is vacated; and the papers in the case are ordered remanded to the Superior Court so that the applicant may be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal.",
