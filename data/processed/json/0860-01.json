        "text": "FERREN, Associate Judge:\nPetitioner, John F. Downs, appeals the Police and Firefighters Retirement and Relief Board\u2019s determination that he is not eligible for benefits under the Police and Firefighters Retirement and Disability Act as a disabled surviving son of a deceased Secret Service Agent. Originally a qualifying recipient whose benefits were properly terminated upon his marriage, Downs petitioned the Board to restore his benefits after his divorce. The Board concluded that petitioner\u2019s marriage permanently disqualified him from benefits and that his divorce did not restore his eligibility. The issue on appeal is whether the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language was reasonable. We conclude that it was and thus find no error in the Board\u2019s decision not to resume Downs\u2019 benefits after his divorce. We therefore affirm.\nI.\nPetitioner was born on July 4, 1944, the son of a member of the United States Secret Service. In 1960, Downs suffered a spinal cord injury which left him a permanent quadriplegic. After his father\u2019s death in July 1978, Downs petitioned the Board for an annuity benefit under D.C.Code \u00a7 4-622 (1994 Repl.), which provides certain surviving children of deceased police officers, firefighters, and United States Secret Service Agents with annuity benefits.\nThe Board found Downs eligible for benefits because he qualified under D.C.Code \u00a7 4 \u2014 607(5) (A) (iii) 7 which defines eligible child survivors to include \u201csuch unmarried child[ren] regardless of age, who, because of physical or mental disability incurred before the age of 18, [are] incapable of self-support.\u201d Downs received an annual annuity between 1978 and 1982 after the Board found him eligible.\nDowns married in 1982. The Board, in response, terminated his benefits in March 1983 pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 4-622(e)(2)(B), which provides that an eligible child\u2019s annuity \u201cterminate[s]\u201d when the child marries. Downs did not contest the Board\u2019s ruling. Downs remained married from October 1982 through November 1993.\nOn November 15, 1993, the District Court of Marshall County, Kansas, granted the Downses a divorce. John Downs thereafter petitioned the Board to resume his annuity, arguing that his divorce restored his eligibility under \u00a7 4-607(5)(A)(iii) as a physically disabled child incapable of self-support. The Board, by order dated April 11, 1994, concluded that Downs was not eligible to receive survivor benefits, interpreting \u00a7 4-622(e)(2) to mean that an annuity is terminated once an eligible child marries, and that it is not reestablished upon a later divorce. Downs has appealed the Board\u2019s ruling.\nII.\nThe statutory provision at the heart of this controversy is D.C.Code \u00a7 4-622(e), which sets forth a list of conditions that disqualify an otherwise eligible child from receiving an annuity. Section 4-622(e)(2) provides:\nThe annuity of any child under this section ... shall terminate upon whichever of the following occurs first:\n(A) The child becomes 18 years of age or, if over 18 years of age and incapable of self-support, becomes capable of self-support;\n(B) The child marries; or\n(C) The child dies.\nSection 4-622(e)(l) similarly provides that the annuity of a widow or widower shall also be terminated by remarriage before the age 60. That provision, however, in contrast with \u00a7 4 \u2014 622(e)(2), restores a remarried widow\u2019s or widower\u2019s annuity \u201cif such remarriage is later terminated by death, annulment, or divorce.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 4 \u2014 622(e)(1).\nThe Board interprets \u00a7 4-622(e)(2) as setting forth conditions that permanently terminate the annuity provided to eligible children under the statute. The Board, in particular, interprets \u00a7 4-622(e)(2)(B) to mean that when an otherwise eligible child marries, his or her annuity permanently ends even if the child later becomes divorced. Downs, who seeks resumption of his benefits as a disabled child survivor under \u00a7 4-607(5)(A)(iii), maintains that \u00a7 4 \u2014 622(e)(2)(B) should be interpreted to mean that an eligible child\u2019s annuity benefits should be suspended for the period of the marriage and resumed upon termination of the marriage.\nWe defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or regulations it is responsible for enforcing as long as the interpretation is not plainly wrong or inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent. See Fort Chaplin Park Associates v. District of Columbia Rental Housing Comm\u2019n, 649 A.2d 1076, 1080 (D.C. 1994); Tesfamariam v. District of Columbia Dept. of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, 645 A.2d 1105, 1108 (D.C.1994). We are concerned here with the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Disability Act, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 4-601 to -634 (1994 Repl.), the statute under which it operates.\nThere appeal\u2019s to be neither case law or legislative history relevant to interpreting D.C.Code \u00a7 4-622. We conclude, nonetheless, that the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4-622(e)(2)(B) is reasonable. The court favors interpretations consistent with the plain language of a statute. See J. Parreco & Son v. Rental Housing Comm\u2019n, 567 A.2d 43, 45 (D.C.1989); Peoples Drug Stores v. District of Columbia, 470 A.2d 751, 753 (D.C. 1983) (en banc). As the Board noted in its April 11, 1994 order, the plain language of the statute states that an annuity shall \u201cterminate,\u201d not be suspended, whenever any of the enumerated events \u2014 such as the child\u2019s marriage, or the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday if the child is capable of self-support \u2014 takes place. D.C.Code \u00a7 4-622(e)(2). Section 4-622(e)(2), moreover, contrasts with \u00a7 4-622(e)(1), which specifically resumes the annuity of a remarried widow or widower whose remarriage later ends through death, annulment, or divorce. Finally, \u00a7 4-607, under which Downs seeks to requalify for an annuity as a disabled child survivor, contains no language upon which Downs may rely.\nThe Board, moreover, offers a reasonable public policy rationale supporting its interpretation that \u00a7 4-622 benefits terminate upon marriage. The Board concludes that \u00a7 4M522(e)(2) reflects the view that a child remains a dependent of a deceased parental uniformed officer until one of the listed events occurs. At that point, however, the chain of dependency between child and parent is presumed to be broken, permanently disqualifying the child from the parent\u2019s annuity benefits. Insofar as the listed events, such as a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, marriage, or death, are traditionally viewed as severing the bonds of dependence between child and parent, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the public policy underlying \u00a7 4-622(e)(2) comports with the statutory language and\u2019 is reasonable- \u2014 especially in light of case law construing similar statutes. Cf. Fiola v. Sullivan, 922 F.2d 526, 527 (9th Cir.1990) (concluding that Secretary\u2019s interpretation of Social Security Act to terminate child insurance benefits permanently upon marriage not so irrational as to deny equal protection); McMahon v. Califano, 605 F.2d 49, 53 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 444 U.S. 847, 100 S.Ct. 93, 62 L.Ed.2d 60 (1979) (upholding as reasonable Secretary\u2019s interpretation of Social Security Act to terminate child insurance benefits permanently upon marriage); Gloss v. Railroad Retirement Board, 114 U.S.App. D.C. 177, 179, 313 F.2d 568, 570 (D.C.Cir. 1962) (upholding Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s interpretation of Railroad Retirement Act to terminate -widow\u2019s annuity permanently upon remarriage despite subsequent annulment of marriage); Nott v. Flemming, 272 F.2d 380, 382 (2d Cir.1959) (upholding trial court\u2019s interpretation of Social Security Act to terminate widow\u2019s benefits permanently upon remarriage despite subsequent annulment of marriage). The Board was free to view appellant\u2019s marriage, for purposes of his eligibility under \u00a7 4-622(e)(2), as an irrevocable threshold that, once crossed, severed the bond entitling him to a \u00a7 4-622 annuity.\nAffirmed.\n. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"terminate\u201d as \"to bring to an ending or cessation in time, sequence or continuity\u201d and \"to end formally and definitely.\" See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2359 (3rd ed. 1986) (emphasis added).\n. D.C.Code \u00a7 4-607(5)(A)(iii) defines \"child\u201d for purposes of the statute to include \"such unmarried child regardless of age who, because of physical or mental disability incurred before the age of 18, is incapable of self-support.\u201d While \u00a7 4-607 sets forth the initial qualifying conditions for a child annuity, \u00a7 4 \u2014 622(e)(2) sets forth the disqualifying conditions.",
