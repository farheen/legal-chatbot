        "text": "OPINION BY\nLAZARUS, J.:\n\u00b6 1 Henry Willis appeals his judgment of sentence imposed on August 28, 2008 after a jury found him guilty of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and criminal use of a communications facility. Willis received concurrent sentences of 7 \\ to 15 years and 1 to 2 years in prison, respectively.\n\u00b6 2 Willis claims that he is entitled to: (1) an arrest of judgment because the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of disproving entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) a new trial as a result of the trial court\u2019s error in instructing the jury. We affirm.\n\u00b6 3 The trial court, in its opinion dated November 14, 2008, sets forth the salient facts as follows:\nIn early January 2006, [Philadelphia Police] Officer [Graziano] Iezzi, a deputized member of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) local task force, began to investigate [Willis] for possible involvement in the sale of narcotics. [Willis] became a target for investigation when a federal prisoner named Howard Jones provided [Willis\u2019] name to federal authorities as part of a proffer with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office. Under the supervision and direction of Officer Iezzi, a confidential informant known as \u201cPockets\u201d placed several phone calls to [Willis] between January 11 and March 22, 2006. During these phone calls, \u201cPockets\u201d arranged three separate purchases of crack cocaine from [Willis] at 12th and Filbert Streets in Philadelphia on February 3rd, February 15th and March 22nd. [Willis] was arrested before completing the third sale.\nTrial Court Opinion, 11/14/08, at 2.\n\u00b6 4 At trial, Willis asserted the defense of entrapment, claiming that the government, through the actions of its informant Howard Jones, entrapped him into committing crimes he otherwise would not have committed.\n\u00b6 5 The defense of entrapment is set forth in 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 313:\n(a) GeneRal Rule.' \u2014 -A public law enforcement official or a person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting such offense by either:\n(1) making knowingly false representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is not prohibited; or\n(2) employing methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.\n(b) B\u00fcRDEn of Proof. \u2014 Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person prosecuted for an offense shall be acquitted if he proves by a preponderance of evidence that his conduct occurred in response to an entrapment.\n(c) EXCEPTION. \u2014 The defense afforded by this section is unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is based on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 313.\n\u00b6 6 Willis first argues that he is entitled to an arrest of judgment due to the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to \u201cdisprove\u201d entrapment. Prior to 1972, when the new Crimes Code was enacted, the law employed a \u201csubjective\u201d test to determine whether a defendant had been entrapped. The focus was on the defendant\u2019s predisposition to committing the crime, rather than the conduct of law enforcement. Commonwealth v. Jensch, 348 Pa.Super. 142, 501 A.2d 687, 688 (1985). As such, the burden fell on the Commonwealth to disprove entrapment (or lack of intent) beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. However, upon the enactment of 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 313 as part of the 1972 Crimes Code, the burden, along with the nature of the test to determine entrapment, shifted. Id. The focus of the fact-finder\u2019s inquiry became the conduct of the police and the burden shifted to defendants to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they had been entrapped. Commonwealth v. Jones, 242 Pa.Super. 303, 363 A.2d 1281, 1285 (1976); see also 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 313(b). Thus, Willis\u2019 first argument, that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proof, is misplaced and must fail.\n\u00b6 7 Willis also claims that he is entitled to a new trial as a result of erroneous jury instructions by the trial court. Specifically, he complains of the following portion of the jury charge:\nIf somebody who is not a police officer engages in conduct beyond that requested by or expressly or impliedly authorized by the police, then that may not be considered on the issue of entrapment.\nN.T., 7/10/08, at 126.\n\u00b6 8 Willis asserts that this part of the charge was not supported by any testimony presented at trial and had the prejudicial effect of \u201cemasculating\u201d his entrapment defense. Brief of Appellant at 37.\n\u00b6 9 The defense of entrapment, as defined in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is based upon an objective standard intended to deter overreaching on the part of law enforcement and those individuals acting in cooperation with law enforcement, such as confidential informants. However, the government may only be held accountable for the acts of a third party if those acts were taken at the request or direction of law enforcement. See Commonwealth v. Lindenmuth, 381 Pa.Super. 398, 554 A.2d 62, 65-66 (1989); Commonwealth v. Manley, 252 Pa.Super. 77, 380 A.2d 1290, 1294 (1977).\n\u00b6 10 In this case, the crux of Willis\u2019 defense is the alleged conduct of Howard \u201cWing Ding\u201d Jones, a lifelong friend of Willis\u2019 who was, at the time, in federal custody and attempting to secure leniency by providing information to the authorities. According to Willis, \u201cWing Ding\u201d repeatedly pressured him to engage in the sale of illegal narcotics to another informant named \u201cPockets.\u201d Willis testified that \u201cWing Ding\u201d called him from prison 25 to 30 times between January 11 and March 22, 2006. N.T., 7/9/08, at 147. Willis testified that he only acceded to his old friend\u2019s request because he believed \u201cWing Ding\u201d was prone to violence, even from behind prison walls, and thus feared for the safety of his wife and family if he did not cooperate. N.T., 7/9/08, at 143-44. Willis argues that \u201cWing Ding\u201d engaged in this harassing behavior in his capacity as a government informant; that the authorities knew or should have known about the allegedly harassing phone calls, yet did nothing to stop them; and, as a result, the conduct must be attributed to the government.\n\u00b6 11 In contrast to Willis\u2019 version of events, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Police Officer Joseph Ferd-man, who at the time of these events was a Philadelphia Housing Police Officer on loan to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Officer Ferdman testified that he was in the room at the time \u201cWing Ding\u201d made his proffer to the federal authorities. N.T., 7/8/08, at 34-36. He stated that \u2018Wing Ding\u201d called Willis at the behest of the authorities to set in motion the transaction between Willis and \u201cPockets.\u201d Id. He also testified that, as an investigator assigned to the case, he would have been aware of any phone calls made by Wing Ding\u201d in connection with the investigation and that, to his knowledge, only one call was made. Id., at 36.\n\u00b6 12 The conflicting testimony regarding the number of calls made by \u201cWing Ding\u201d at the behest or acquiescence of the government created a genuine issue of fact for the jury. The standard jury instructions do not contain a specific instruction regarding the responsibility of law enforcement for actions of cooperators taken independent of the direction or control of authorities. See Pa. SSJI \u00a7 8.313. Accordingly, the trial court crafted its own instruction reflecting its understanding of the applicable law, namely Lindenmuth and Manley, supra. Trial Court Opinion, 11/14/08, at 5.\n\u00b6 13 The nature of a court\u2019s instructions to the jury is \u201cwithin the discretion of the court, so long as the court accurately instructs the jury on the appropriate legal principles involved.\u201d Commonwealth v. Kim, 888 A.2d 847, 852 (Pa.Super.2005) (quoting Commonwealth v. Hartey, 424 Pa.Super. 29, 621 A.2d 1023, 1028 (1993)). This Court\u2019s main concern is \u201cthat the charge clearly, adequately, and accurately presents the law to the jury for its consideration.\u201d Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Collins, 810 A.2d 698, 701 (Pa.Super.2002)). The jury charge must be reviewed \u201cnot in isolated portions but as a whole to ascertain whether it fairly conveys the required legal principles at issue.\u201d Commonwealth v. McClendon, 874 A.2d 1223, 1232 (Pa.Super.2005).\n\u00b6 14 After a thorough review of the trial court\u2019s entire jury charge, this Court is satisfied that the jury was provided with a comprehensive and accurate presentation of the law as it applied to this case. The specific portion of the charge complained of by Willis was entirely appropriate given the key issue in this case, which was whether law enforcement was responsible for the alleged conduct of \u201cWing Ding.\u201d\n\u00b6 15 Judgment of sentence affirmed.",
