At the oral argument counsel for Ronzio, Inc. did not appear, although court records indicate that he had been notified.\nAfter hearing oral argument by counsel for Richard Gurian and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The promissory note was clear and unambiguous on its face. The matter sought to be raised by the defendant in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s claim was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.\nConsequently, the defendant\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed. The summary judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff is affirmed.\nFAY, C.J., and MURRAY, J., did not participate.",
