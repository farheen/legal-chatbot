        "text": "KING, Senior Judge:\nLincoln Hockey, LLC, d/b/a Washington Capitals, petitions for review of the District of Columbia Department of Employment Services\u2019 (DOES) award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Jamie Huscroft, a former player in the Capitals\u2019 professional hockey organization. Huscroft was injured while playing in a regular-season game for the Portland Pirates, a Capitals minor-league affiliate. He filed a claim for unemployment benefits under the District of Columbia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA), and DOES granted his claim. The Capitals contend that DOES erred in finding that Huscroft\u2019s claim came within the jurisdiction of the WCA and in declining to limit Huscroft\u2019s award according to the work life expectancy of a professional hockey player. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nI.\nHuscroft was signed by the Capitals in 1999 to a two-year, \u201ctwo way\u201d contract to play professional hockey. Under this \u201ctwo way\u201d contract, Huscroft could be assigned to play for the Capitals in the National Hockey League (NHL) or for its minor league affiliate, the Portland Pirates, which competes in the American Hockey League (AHL). The Capitals play then-home games in the District of Columbia, while the Pirates play their home games in Portland, Maine. During the 1999-2000 hockey season, Huseroft played in thirty to forty games for the Pirates and in seven games for the Capitals. Huseroft was with the Capitals during the 2000 NHL playoffs, but he did not dress for the games. On October 18, 2000, four games into the second year of his contract, Hus-eroft suffered a career-ending head injury in a Pirates game played in Quebec, Canada. He was thirty-three at the time of the injury, making him one of the oldest players in the AHL.\nAfter the 2000-2001 season ended, when his contract expired, Huseroft filed a claim under the WCA, D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1501 et seq. (2001), seeking temporary total disability benefits from May 1, 2001, to July 31, 2001, and temporary partial disability benefits from August 1, 2001, \u201cto the present and continuing.\u201d On September 7, 2007, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a Compensation Order finding that an employer/employee relationship existed, that Huscroft\u2019s injury was causally related to the accident in the October 2000 hockey game, and that Huseroft was entitled to temporary total disability benefits from May 1, 2001, to July 31, 2001, and temporary partial disability payments from August 1, 2001, to the completion of his work-life expectancy.\nOn the Capitals\u2019 petition for review, the Compensation Review Board (CRB) reversed and remanded the ALJ\u2019s Order on the ground that substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the claim came within the jurisdiction of the WCA. The CRB specifically observed that the WCA covers injuries occurring outside the District of Columbia only \u201cif, at the time of the injury or death, the employment is localized principally in the District of Columbia.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1503(a)(2) (2001). The CRB remanded, concluding that \u201ca determination is required as to the nature of Respondent\u2019s employment relationship with the District at the time of his injury, and whether that relationship constitutes a set of substantial and legitimate contacts with the District more significant here than elsewhere.\u201d\nOn remand, the ALJ considered anew the jurisdictional issue, and on February 29, 2008, it issued a Compensation Order on Remand, again finding that the claim came within the jurisdiction of the WCA. The ALJ found that the Capitals\u2019 principal business was playing professional hockey games, that their arena was located in the District of Columbia, that Huseroft was hired principally to play in NHL games, and that ultimately, his participation in AHL games was \u201cancillary to preparing for NHL games\u201d for the Capitals. The ALJ also rejected an argument that D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1508(3)(W) mandated Hus-croft\u2019s award be limited by his work-life expectancy as a professional athlete. The ALJ awarded temporary total disability benefits from May to July of 2001 and temporary partial disability benefits from August of 2001 \u201cto the present and continuing.\u201d\nOn June 10, 2008, the CRB reversed and remanded a second time. The CRB concluded that under the WCA, an award of temporary partial disability benefits may not be of an indefinite duration but must be limited to not more than five years, citing D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1508(5). The CRB also remanded for renewed findings of fact with respect to the causal relationship between the injury and the disability. The CRB, however, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determinations with respect to jurisdiction and work-life expectancy. On August 8, 2008, the ALJ made renewed findings on the causal relationship and limited Huscroft\u2019s award to five years, pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1508(5). On October 31, 2008, the CRB affirmed the compensation award. While the Capitals did not re-argue the issues of jurisdiction and work-life expectancy before the CRB, they preserved them right to petition this court for review of those claims, and they timely filed their petition with this court. We have evaluated their claims under our well-established standards of agency review, and conclude that the compensation award should be affirmed.\nII.\nWe may not disturb a DOES compensation award unless \u201cit is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d Children\u2019s Nat\u2019l Med. Ctr. v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 992 A.2d 403, 405 (D.C.2010). We will uphold the agency\u2019s decision provided that \u201c(1) the agency made findings of fact on each contested material factual issue, (2) substantial evidence supports each finding, and (3) the agency\u2019s conclusions of law flow rationally from its findings of fact.\u201d Georgetown Univ. v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 971 A.2d 909, 915 (D.C.2009). We will defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers, unless that interpretation \u201cis unreasonable or in contravention of the language\u201d of the statute. Watergate East Comm. Against Hotel Conversion v. District of Columbia Zoning Comm\u2019n, 953 A.2d 1036, 1043 (D.C.2008). \u201cIndeed, we must sustain the agency\u2019s interpretation even if a petitioner advances another reasonable interpretation of the statute or if we might have been persuaded by the alternate interpretation had we been construing the statute in the first instance.\u201d Mushroom Transp. v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 761 A.2d 840, 844 (D.C.2000) (citation omitted).\nBecause Huscroft\u2019s injury was incurred outside the District, the WCA only covers his claim if at the time of the injury, his employment was \u201clocalized principally in the District of Columbia.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1503(a)(2) (2001). In Hughes v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 498 A.2d 567 (D.C.1985), this court approved the agency\u2019s consideration of the following factors in considering whether a claimant\u2019s employment was \u201clocalized principally\u201d in the District:\n1) The place(s) of the employee\u2019s business office(s) or faeility(ies) at which or from which the employee performs the principal service(s) for which he was hired; or\n2) If there is no such office or facility at which the employee works, the employee\u2019s residence, the place where the contract is made and the place of performance; or\n3) If neither (1) nor (2) is applicable, the employee\u2019s base of operations.\nId. at 569. In Petrilli v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 509 A.2d 629 (D.C.1986), we concluded that \u201cemployment principally localized in the District\u201d means \u201ca claimant\u2019s employment relationship with this jurisdiction must have contacts more substantial here than in any other place.\u201d Id. at 633.\nIn analyzing Huscroft\u2019s claim, DOES relied upon our decision in Pro-Football, Inc. v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 588 A.2d 275 (D.C.1991). In that case, fourteen former Washington Redskins players filed claims for unemployment compensation based on football-related injuries. Id. at 276. The record showed that while the claimants played more games in the District \u2014 at RFK stadium \u2014 than in any other jurisdiction, the team\u2019s practice facility was in Virginia, which meant that \u201cthe amount of time spent by each player in Virginia substantially exceeded] the amount spent in the District.\u201d Id. at 277. Nevertheless, we affirmed the compensation award based on the agency\u2019s findings that the Redskins are a business whose purpose is to make money and \u201cthe principal service for which [the players were] hired was to play in regularly scheduled NFL football games,\u201d the plurality of which took place in the District. Id. at 278. As for the practices in Virginia, we sustained the agency\u2019s finding that \u201ca professional athlete\u2019s practice is merely preparatory to the game.\u201d Id. at 279. Thus, under the first prong of the Hughes test, we held the agency could reasonably conclude that the players\u2019 employment was principally localized in the District.\nIn the present case, the ALJ similarly found that the principal duty for which Huscroft was hired was to play in regularly scheduled NHL games for the Capitals. Despite the fact that Huscroft actually spent more time in Portland than in the District, the ALJ found his activities with the Portland Pirates, including playing in AHL games, were \u201cancillary to preparing for NHL games.\u201d In support of this finding, the ALJ cited the testimony of Frank Provenzano, the Assistant General Manager for the Capitals at the time. Provenza-no, who negotiated Huscroft\u2019s contract, testified that Huscroft was a good defensive hockey player, one who could step in and provide a veteran presence for the Capitals at the NHL level. Further, while Provenzano hoped Huscroft could also provide a winning environment for the Portland Pirates, he indicated that he \u201cwanted a winning environment at the affiliate to obtain a winning environment at the ... NHL level.\u201d Indeed, Provenzano testified at the hearing that the AHL is \u201cprimarily a development league for the [NHL].\u201d\nFurther, the record shows that even when Huscroft was playing for the Pirates, the Capitals maintained complete control over his activities. His paycheck came directly from the Capitals, he could be called up to the NHL at any time at the Capitals\u2019 discretion, and the Capitals \u201ccontrolled all on[-]ice hockey operations\u201d of the Pirates, including \u201cthe full roster, coaches and trainers.\u201d All of this evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Huscroft\u2019s \u201cparticipation in AHL games served as the functional equivalent of preparatory practice for NHL games.\u201d\nThe CRB concluded the ALJ\u2019s findings on the jurisdiction of the WCA were supported by substantial evidence in the record and resulted from a reasonable application of appropriate legal principles. We agree. The fact that the Capitals signed Huscroft to contribute to the achievement of their business objective of winning hockey games in the District shows that under the first prong of the Hughes test, Hus-croft \u201cperformed] the principal services for which he was hired\u201d in the District. Hughes, 498 A.2d at 569. Further, the fact that the Capitals, and not the Pirates, controlled all aspects of Huscroft\u2019s employment, shows that Huscroft\u2019s employment relationship had \u201ccontacts more substantial here than in any other place.\u201d Petrilli, 509 A.2d at 633. The CRB\u2019s affirmance of the compensation award is reasonable under either articulation.\nThe Capitals contend that instead of Pro-Football, Huscroft\u2019s case should be controlled by our holding in Furtick v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 921 A.2d 787 (D.C.2007). In that case, we concluded that the jurisdiction of the WCA did not reach the claim of an employee who was injured while working in the Republic of Georgia for an international agency whose main office was located in the District. Id. at 788, 795. In that case, however, the employer\u2019s \u201cbusiness was internationally oriented and apparently geared toward staffing projects in other parts of the world,\u201d and \u201c[i]ts relationship with the District was a matter of convenience.\u201d Id. at 794. By contrast, the Capitals\u2019 business is locally oriented and its relationship to the District no mere matter of convenience: its principal purpose, as the ALJ found, is to play hockey games, more of which it plays in the District than in any other jurisdiction. Whereas Fur-tick\u2019s employment contract contemplated performance of his employer\u2019s business objectives in entirely international settings, Huscroft\u2019s contract contemplated ultimate performance in the District, where the Capitals\u2019 NHL activities were centralized. The ALJ and the CRB could reasonably find, and did find, Furtick distinguishable. We are satisfied that the agency\u2019s determination is reasonable and not in contravention of the language of the statute. Watergate, 953 A.2d at 1043. Accordingly, we do not disturb it.\nIII.\nWe also find no merit in the Capitals\u2019 other challenge to the compensation award. The Capitals contend that at the time of the accident, Huscroft was either at or near the end of his professional hockey career, and that DOES was required to limit Huscroft\u2019s award according to his work-life expectancy as a professional athlete, pursuant to \u00a7 32-1508(3)(W) of the WCA. That subsection provides:\nThe compensation and remuneration payable to a professional athlete claimant pursuant to subparagraph (V)(ii) of this paragraph shall be determined by referring to the date of the claimant\u2019s disability and a date that is not later than the date on which the claimant\u2019s employment as a professional athlete would have ended, as determined pursuant to \u00a7 32-1501(17C), if the disability for which he or she seeks compensation and remuneration pursuant to subpara-graph (V)(ii) of this paragraph had not occurred.\nD.C.Code \u00a7 32-1508(3)(W) (2001). This subsection, however, applies only to claimants seeking compensation pursuant to \u00a7 32-1508(3)(V)(ii), which involves \u201cdisabilities partial in character but permanent in quality.\u201d It is therefore inapplicable to Huscroft, who obtained compensation under \u00a7 32-1508(5), the subsection dealing with his \u201ctemporary partial disability.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 32-1508(5), temporary partial disability awards are limited to a period not exceeding five years, a limitation the agency properly applied to Huscroft\u2019s award.\nThe presence of more specific limiting language in \u00a7 32-1508(3)(W), and the absence of that same language in \u00a7 32-1508(5), persuades us the legislature chose to limit professional athletes\u2019 awards for \u201cpermanent partial\u201d disabilities based on the end of their careers as professional athletes, and that it did not choose to enact the same limitations on athletes\u2019 awards for \u201ctemporary partial\u201d disabilities. See Odemns v. District of Columbia, 930 A.2d 137, 141 (D.C.2007) (courts presume legislature acts purposely when it includes specific language in one section of statute and excludes it from another section). Since by the plain language of \u00a7 82-1508(5), the agency was not required to limit Hus-croft\u2019s claim according to his work-life expectancy as a professional athlete, we need not address the Capitals\u2019 claim further. See BSA 77 P Street LLC v. Hawkins, 983 A.2d 988, 995 (D.C.2009) (if meaning of statute is plain from its face, we must give effect to that plain meaning).\nAccordingly, the Order awarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits is\nAffirmed.\n. Huscroft filed a brief as intervenor, in support of the compensation award. DOES filed a statement in lieu of brief, stating that it would stand on the decisions below and any arguments Huscroft might make.\n. Because the employer does not contest DOES\u2019s finding that Huscroft\u2019s disability was causally related to this injury, we need not address the details of the injury here.\n. We sustained the agency's determination with respect to ten of the fourteen claimants. We remanded for further findings with respect to the remaining four, who, the record showed, had never actually appeared in a regular season game at RFK Stadium. Pro-Football, Inc., supra, 588 A.2d at 279.\n. We have held that it was not necessary to require an employee to work a \"majority\" of hours in the District in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the WCA, holding instead that performing the principal service for which he or she was hired for a plurality of hours in the District is sufficient. Shipkey v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Employment Servs., 955 A.2d 718, 727 (D.C.2008).\n. The Capitals argue that under D.C.Code \u00a7 32-1501(17C) the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation is required to enact rules regarding work-life expectancy for professional athletes in each professional sports franchise in the District, and that thus far that Office has failed to do so. This, the Capitals\u2019 argue, frustrates the purpose of \u00a7 32-1508(3)(W), which clearly contemplates limitations to a professional athlete's compensation award based on the end of his or her career under certain circumstances. While we understand the Capitals\u2019 concern as it relates to other cases where the provision relating to work-life expectancy is applicable, that concern is not implicated here.",
