        "text": "Rich, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\nThis appeal is from a decision of the Patent Office Board of Appeals affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 1-24 and 40 of appellants\u2019 application serial No. 195,430, filed May 17,1962, entitled \u201cCatalyst and Conversion of Organic Compounds in the Presence Thereof.\u201d No claim has been allowed.\nThe invention is a catalyst composition and its method of preparation. Claims 1 and 18 are illustrative:\n1. A catalytic composition, comprising a finely divided crystalline aluminosili-cate having a silica ito alumina mole ratio in excess of 3 distributed throughout and held suspended in a matrix therefor, wherein the negative electrovalence of the silica and alumina of said aluminosilicate is balanced by ions of at least one member .Selected from- the group consisting of metals below sodium in the electromotive series, calcium, ammonium, hydrogen and combinations of such ions with one another.\n18. A method for preparing a catalytic composition which comprises intimately admixing an alkali metal aluminosilicate having a silica to alumina mole ratio in excess of 3 in finely divided form with a binder therefor and base exchanging the resulting composite with a .solution containing ions of at least one member selected from the group consisting of metals below sodium in the electromotive series, calcium, ammonium, hydrogen and combinations of such ions with one another to replace at least about 70 per cent of the original alkali metal ion content of said aluminosilicate and to reduce the exchangeable alkali metal content of the resulting base exchanged composite to less than 3 per cent by weight.\nThe references relied on are:\nPlank et al-.. 3,140, 249 July 7, 1964\nRabo et al--- 3,130,006 Apr. 21,1964\nPlank et al., a patent issued to appellants about two years after the filing date of the application at bar, also claims a catalyst composition and a process of preparing and using it. Its claims are used as the basis for a double patenting rejection. It is not a prior are reference. While many claims are relied on, claims 16 and 17 are of chief interest:\n16. A catalytic composition comprising an inorganic oxide matrix having distributed therein a finely divided crystalline aluminosilicate, which alumino-silicate is obtained by: (1) crystallization from a reaction mixture whose composition expressed in terms of oxide mole ratios falls within the following ranges: and (2) subsequent base exchange of the resulting crystallized product\nSi02/Al203_From 3 to 5\nNa^O/Sith- From 1.2 to 1.5\nH20/Na20_ From 35 to 60\nsubstantially free of sodium ions, said composition having an overall sodium content of less than about 1 weight percent.\n17. The process which comprises preparing a reaction mixture whose composition expressed in terms of oxide mole ratios falls within the following ranges:\nSiCVAl203_From 3 to 5\nNa20/Si02_ From 1.2 to 1.5\nH20/Na20_ From 35 to 60\nbase exchanging the product which crystallizes from said mixture until said product is substantiaUy free of sodium ions, combining the base-exchanged material, in finely divided form, with a porous inorganic oxide, the latter serving as a matrix for the former and the resultant composite having an overall sodium content less than about 1 weight percent and utilizing the composition so obtained as a catalyst in the conversion of hydrocarbons.\nRabo et al., cited to show prior art, discloses an aluminosilicate compound prepared \u201cby ion-exchanging a substantial portion of the metal cations of a crystalline zeolitic metal aluminosilicate having a Si02/Al203 ratio of greater than about 3.0, with protons or more preferably with ammonium cations, followed by thermal treatment at temperatures of between 850\u00b0C, and 600\u00b0C., and preferably at temperatures of between 475\u00b0C. and 600\u00b0C.\u201d The process is further described:\nThe process by whicb the novel materials of this invention are produced may he called \u201cdeeationization.\u201d The deeationized molecular sieve alumino-silicates produced thereby, having at least some of their aluminum atoms unbalanced by cationic substituents and yet having unimpaired crystalline configuration have, in addition to the adsorbent properties of all molecular sieves, further use as hydrocarbon conversion catalysts. Among the hydrocarbon converting processes which may be catalyzed by the novel compositions of this invention are cracking or hydrocracking processes.\nThe examiner rejected all of appellants\u2019 claims on the claims in the Plank et al., patent in view of Rabo et al. He explained:\nThe Plank et al. patent claims a similar catalyst composition * \u215c * together with a dilutent; the crystalline zeolite may contain metals from the group IIA IIIB and IVA of the Periodic Table. While the said claims do not specify that the crystalline zeolite is of the V type, having a ratio of silica to alumina greater than 3, such insertion in the patent claims does not entitle the applicants to an additional patent, since the art knew at the time this application was filed that the use of the X type of crystalline zeolite in that composition of the patent claims produces a catalyst composite having improved properties, such as being more steam resistant, greater resistance to abrasion has greater adsorption and better catalyst properties as taught by Rabo et al. \u215c \u2021 *.\nIn other words, he felt that the limitation of the claims in the application to crystalline zeolite with a silica-to-alumina ratio \u201cin excess of 3\u201d (Y-type) created no more than \u201ca colorable distinction\u201d from the claims in the patent.\nAppellants\u2019 assignee filed a terminal disclaimer. The examiner, however, was of the opinion that the double patenting rejection could not thus be obviated. He said:\nThe Examiner in reply wishes to state that in spite of the filing of a disclaimer limiting the period of the patent term to that of the Plank et al. patent, to merely specify in the patent claims that the crystalline zeolite is of the X type with its known advantages as shown in the Rabo et al. patent is merely a colorable difference from the patent claims, and does not entitle appellants to another patent for the same invention. []\nThe board agreed with the examiner\u2019s rejection:\n* * * in -view of the advantageous properties taught by Rabo et al. * * * it would be obvious to one skilled in this art to select as the aluminosilicate component of the catalytic composition of the Plank et al. patent the so-called \u201cY\u201d type with the expectation of obtaining the advantageous results urged by appellants to support a separate patent.\nThe board also thought the disclaimer ineffective to obviate the rejection. It was unmoved by appellants\u2019 citation of In re Robeson, 51 CCPA 1271, 331 F. 2d 610, 141 USPQ 485 (1964) and In re Kaye, 51 CCPA 1465, 332 F. 2d 816, 141 USPQ 829 (1964):\n* * * the factual situation herein is entirely different from that presented in the cited decisions in that the claims herein differ in scope only from those of the patent. The relationship is genus-to-species rather than the species-to-speeies relation presented in the cited decisions.\nSince the board wrote its opinion herein, we have decided that the terminal disclaimer is efficacious to obviate double patenting rejections in the genus-species situations. In re Jentoft, 55 CCPA 1026, 392 F. 2d 633, 157 USPQ 363 (1968); In re Braithwaite, 54 CCPA 1589, 379 F. 2d 594, 154 USPQ 29 (1967); In re Braithwaite, 54 CCPA 1604, 379 F. 2d 606, 154 USPQ 38 (1967). The present effect of the disclaimer is to limit the inquiry to whether the same invention is twice claimed. In re Boylan, 55 CCPA 1041, 392 F. 2d 1017, 157 USPQ 370 (1968); In re Eckel, CCPA 1068, 393 F. 2d 848, 157 USPQ 415 (1968). We look only to see whether the differences between the patented claims and those applied for are sham or real, semantic or actual. In re Eckel, supra; In re Wright, 55 CCPA 1106, 393 F. 2d 1001, 157 USPQ 519 (1968). The board\u2019s opinion undertook no such analysis and therefore cannot stand on its own rationale.\nThe solicitor, however, presented an alternative rationale at oral argument. He stipulated, in effect, that claims 16 and 17 of the patent cover aluminosilicates in which the silica to alumina ratio is 3 or less. The application claims, he argues, cover aluminosili-cates with ratios above about 3. He urges that the patent and application therefore claim the \u201csame invention,\u201d i.e., aluminosilicates with a silica to alumina ratio of about 3.\nThis is no more than the \u201coverlap\u201d argument we repudiated in the Braithwaite cases. The mere fact that claims in part delimit a common area will not prevent efficiacious use of a terminal disclaimer to obviate a double-patenting rejection.\nThe decision of the board is reversed,\nWorley, C. J., concurs in the result.\nConsisting of Lidoff, Behrens and Mangan, Examiners-in-Chief, opinion by Lidoff.\nAssignee, Soeony Mobil Oil Company, Inc., which is also assignee of the instant application.\nAssignee, Union Carbide Corporation.\nThe disclaimer, pursuant to 35 USC 253, 2nd para., disclaimed that part of the term of any patent maturing from the application on appeal after July 7, 1981, which is the expiration date of Plank et al. patent No. 3,140,249, commonly owned.\nThe examiner\u2019s use of the terms \u201ccolorable distinction\u201d and \u201ccolorable difference\u201d shows how unsatisfactory the word \u201ccolorable\u201d is as a means of communicating a clear idea of the ground of rejection. The examiner says the \u201csame Invention\u201d Is being claimed as Is claimed in the patent. What then does he Intend by the term \u201ccolorable\u201d? Does he mean there Is no difference or distinction or does he mean that the difference\u2014 the use of Y-type zeolite \u2014 is obvious 1 If he does not intend the latter meaning, then why does he rely on Rabo et al? It does not take a reference to show that there Is no difference. It may take one to show that where there Is a difference, the difference is not such as to render the claimed invention as a whole unobvious. See In re Eckel, 55 CCPA 1068, 393 F. 2d 848, 157 USPQ 415, for further observations on \u201ccolorable.\u201d This field of law will progress toward clarity with greater alacrity if the use of the word is abandoned and rejections are stated in less ambiguous terms.\nArguably \u201cinherent\u201d in one of the board\u2019s comments. The solicitor\u2019s brief supported the board. However, by oral argument, he thought it better, in view of our recent cases, not to pursue the \u201cissues\u201d briefed.\nClaims 16 and 17 of the patent define the catalyst in terms of starting materials. The silica to alumina ratio of the product, according to the solicitor\u2019s argument, is 2.5 \u00b1 0.5.",
