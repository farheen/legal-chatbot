Contrary to his first contention, it was not obvious error to allow the prosecutor to refer to the defendant as \u201ca convicted thief\u201d during argument, because the evidence showed that the defendant had been convicted for the theft offense of receiving stolen property, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 351, 359. See State v. Hinds, 485 A.2d 231, 237 (Me.1984). Nor was it obvious error to allow the defendant, at the prosecutor\u2019s request, to stand next to a witness before the jury. The comparison was relevant and not unduly prejudicial. M.R.Evid. 403; see State v. Johnson 472 A.2d 1367, 1372 (Me.1984).\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.",
