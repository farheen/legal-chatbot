        "text": "GLASSMAN, Justice.\nThe Maine Unemployment Insurance Commission (Commission) appeals from a Superior Court, Kennebec County, judgment reversing the Commission\u2019s decision that the plaintiff, Walter Snell, left his employment voluntarily within the meaning of 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1193(1)(A) (Supp. 1983-1984). We reverse the judgment of the Superior Court and affirm the decision of the Commission.\nI.\nSnell was employed as a full-time courier for Ad-Media Company in Augusta on September 4, 1979. He was required to furnish his own car to carry out his duties and in addition to an hourly wage, he was compensated for the travel mileage accrued during working hours. On December 31, 1982, Ad-Media reduced Snell\u2019s working hours to three days a week. Snell, continued his employment until January 21, 1983, when his car became inoperable. Thereafter, he did not return to work.\nA deputy Commissioner, finding that Snell left his employment voluntarily without good cause attributable to his employment, 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1193(1)(A), temporarily disqualified him from receiving compensation. The appeal tribunal confirmed the deputy\u2019s decision, and Snell appealed to the Commission. Snell contended that the economic impact of reduced hours and pay and car problems compelled him to \u201cinvoluntarily leave his job with good cause attributable to his employment.\u201d The Commission affirmed the decision of the appeal tribunal. The Superior Court, without opinion, reversed the Commission\u2019s decision. The Commission now seeks review of that reversal.\nII.\nIn reviewing a decision of the Commission, we examine the record to determine whether competent evidence exists to support the Commission\u2019s findings, giving proper deference to its fact-finding role, and whether controlling law has been correctly applied. Brousseau v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 470 A.2d 327, 329 (Me.1984); Dubois v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 150 Me. 494, 114 A.2d 359 (Me.1955).\nThe Commission found, inter alia, that Snell\u2019s employment contract was conditioned upon Snell\u2019s \u201chaving a dependable car for the performances of his services\u201d; that as the result of trouble with his car in late 1982, he \u201cbecame undependable for certain deadline jobs handled by the employer\u201d causing the employer to reduce Snell\u2019s hours to part-time; that the \u201cemployer\u2019s actions are reasonable in this situation\u201d; and that Snell\u2019s \u201cautomobile problems are personal and not related to his employment conditions.\u201d\nWe have previously defined \u201cvoluntary\u201d in the context of 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1193(1)(A) as \u201cfreely making an affirmative choice\u201d to leave work. Brousseau, 470 A.2d at 330; see Toothaker v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 217 A.2d 203, 206 (Me.1966) (separation by act of employer by discharge or layoff involuntary, by will of employee, voluntary). Snell did not claim that his act of leaving work was not a freely made affirmative choice but that it was motivated by the economic pressures of his circumstances. The sole issue then becomes did he have \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1193(1)(A) to leave his job. Snell had the burden to establish that good cause did, in fact, exist. Good cause must be measured against a standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances. Kilmartin v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 446 A.2d 412, 414 (Me.1982). Snell\u2019s contention is that the expense of providing a car as required by his employment and the reduction of work hours directly attributable to bis past unreliability in providing a car, should constitute good cause within the meaning of section 1193(1)(A). We cannot agree.\nSnell undertook and continued employment with Ad-Media fully aware of the nature of the work, the level of compensation, and the requirement he provide his own car. The Commission\u2019s finding that the reduction of his hours was directly attributable to his unreliability for certain jobs handled by his employer owing to disrepair of his car was supported by the evidence. Although we have held that a substantial pay reduction may constitute good cause attributable to employment for leaving one\u2019s job, we have done so only in the context of a unilateral reduction by an employer following an employee\u2019s return to work after a layoff. Boucher v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 464 A.2d 171 (Me.1983). Snell\u2019s contract of employment required he furnish his own car. The claimed personal economic inability to meet this condition after January 21, 1983, does not constitute good cause attributable to his employment for thereafter voluntarily leaving his job. The record supported the Commission\u2019s finding that Snell\u2019s automobile problems were personal and not related to his employment conditions. See Kilmartin v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 446 A.2d 412 (Me.1982) (employee\u2019s inability to afford expense for required business trip and reduction of wages as result of transfer not good cause within meaning of section 1193(1)(A)); Toothaker v. Maine Employment Security Commission, 217 A.2d 203 (Me.1966) (employee\u2019s cost of travel in relation to pay not good cause).\nNo matter how compelling the personal reasons for Snell\u2019s failure to appear for work, we hold that the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by credible evidence and are conclusive, and the Commission did not misapply the law in its decision that Snell had voluntarily left his employment without good cause attributable to such employment.\nThe entry is:\nJudgment reversed; remanded for entry of judgment by the Superior Court affirming the decision of the Maine Unemployment Insurance Commission.\nAll concurring.\n. 26 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1193(1)(A) provides in pertinent part:\nAn individual shall be disqualified for benefits ... [f]or the week in which he left his regular employment voluntarily without good cause attributable to such employment, or to a claimant who has voluntarily removed himself from the labor market where presently employed to an area where employment opportunity is less frequent, if so found by the deputy, and disqualification shall continue until claimant has earned 4 times his weekly benefit amount in employment by an employer; provided no disqualification shall be imposed if the individual establishes that he left employment in good faith and accepted new employment on a permanent full-time basis and he became separated from the new employment for good cause attributable to employment with the new employing unit.",
