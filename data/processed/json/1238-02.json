        "text": "ORDER\nThis case came before a three member panel of the Supreme Court on December 20, 1994, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and to show cause why the issues raised in this petition for a writ of certiorari should not be summarily decided.\nPetitioner Bradford Sampson (Sampson), a state employee, accepted a lump sum commutation in the amount of $12,500 minus $1,875 in attorney fees from the State of Rhode Island. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court approved the settlement on December 15, 1993. Sampson subsequently resigned from State employment accepting an accidental disability pension. Sampson was informed by the Employee\u2019s Retirement Board (the board) that his monthly accidental disability payments would be offset by the full lump sum amount. An appeal to the board followed. Following a hearing, the board denied the appeal reaffirming its prior decision. Sampson now seeks issuance of a writ of certiorari. He contends that the board contravened the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court order by offsetting the lump sum amount instead of a weekly amount and failed to interpret G.L. 1956 (1990 Reenactment) \u00a7 36-10-81 correctly.\nSection 36-10-31 clearly requires that the Board offset disability payments by any amounts beneficiaries receive as workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In the present ease, the board found that Sampson received a lump sum benefit from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. They therefore correctly concluded that this amount must be subtracted from the accidental disability pension. However, we believe that \u00a7 36-10-31 does require the board to subtract the attorney fees Sampson incurred from the amount it sets off against Sampson\u2019s accidental disability pension.\nAdditionally, we believe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s Order in no way issues directives to the board or even implies that the board should offset weekly amounts as opposed to the commuted lump-sum amount.\nConsequently, after hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda that the parties submitted, this court concludes that cause has not been shown. Sampson\u2019s petition is denied in part and granted to the extent noted above. The decision of the board is modified to comply with our decision.\nLEDERBERG, J., did not participate in the decision.",
