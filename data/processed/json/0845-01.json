        "text": "WITHAM, J.\nI. Introduction\nBefore this Court is Plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Having considered the briefs of both parties it appears attorney\u2019s fees are appropriate in the case; however, the amount of these fees will not be calculated until all remaining issues in this case are resolved.\nII. Background\nBriefly, the facts of this case are as follows. The Village of Cannon Mill, L.L.C., (Plaintiff or Village) is the owner of a planned residential development known as The Village of Cannon Mill. On January 13,1998, the Delaware Agricultural Land Foundations Preservation Foundation (Defendant), a state agency, approved an application by Farm Lands, L.P., the owner of an adjacent tract of land, creating an agricultural preservation district under title 3, section 6501 of the Delaware Code. As a consequence, any new development would be required to observe a fifty-foot setback. The Village filed suit seeking either declaratory judgment that it is not subject to the setback, or compensation for the unconstitutional taking of its property as a result of having to abide by the setback. In two prior decisions this Court granted summary judgment in favor of the State ruling that the Village had did not have a vested right to either compensation or a declaration that it was not subject to the setback. The Plaintiff appealed this Court\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court determined that the \u201cpermit plus\u201d standard does not control in all situations. The Supreme Court explained that it is unfair to apply the \u201cpermit plus\u201d rule in cases, such as the one presented by the Plaintiff, where the permitting process is complex and multi-lev-eled. Therefore, the Supreme Court concluded \u201cthat the good faith pursuit by the Village of all steps to secure necessary permits for its development precluded, as a matter of law, it being characterized as a \u2018new subdivision\u2019 subject to the fifty-foot setback requirement.\u201d The Supreme Court further held that \u201cBecause it is not subject to the setback requirement, the Village suffered no \u2018taking\u2019 subject to a claim of inverse condemnation.\u201d Additionally, the Supreme Court explained \u201cIn view of our determination that the Village was not a \u2018new subdivision,\u2019 and thus had acquired vested property development rights prior to the establishment of the preservation district, we find it unnecessary to address the claim of unfair process and notice.\u201d The Supreme Court then reversed the two decisions by this Court and remanded the matter to this Court for entry of judgment in favor of the Village declaring that the preservation set back in title 3, section 910(a)(2) of the Delaware Code does not apply to the planned development. On October 24, 2002, this Court entered an Order in favor of the Plaintiff that the preservation setback does not apply to the planned development. Subsequently, by letter, Plaintiffs attorney presented three unresolved issues: (1) interim damages for the time that the Plaintiff could not utilize its property; (2) request that this Court amend its final Order to reflect that the entirety of the Agricultural Preservation Act is inapplicable to the Plaintiffs development; and (3) Plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party. This Order is only concerned with the issue of attorney\u2019s fees and leaves the parties to decide whether or not to pursue the other remaining issues.\nIII. Analysis\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b): \u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983] the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides for a' cause of action for a person who, under the color of law, is deprived of a constitutional right. Specifically, in this case Plaintiff claimed to have suffered an unconstitutional taking of its property rights under the color of state law in violation \u00a7 1983. It is apparent that the Plaintiff did not \u201cprevail\u201d on its \u00a7 1983 claims as the Supreme Court avoided analyzing the merits of the constitutional claim stating that there could be no taking because the setback provision of the preservation act did not apply to the planned development. In addition, because the Plaintiff had a vested property right in the development, the Supreme Court explained that it was \u201cunnecessary to address the claim of unfair process and notice.\u201d Nonetheless, Plaintiff may still be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988, as the Plaintiff did prevail on its state claim.\n\u201cWhere a court has decided a case in favor of the plaintiffs on state grounds and avoided reaching the merits of a \u00a7 1983 claim, fees may nevertheless be awarded under \u00a7 1988 if the \u2018pleaded-but-undecided\u2019 claim meets the \u2018substantiality\u2019 test of Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974).\u201d According to the legislative history of \u00a7 1988:\nTo the extent a plaintiff joins a claim under one of the statutes enumerated in H.R. 15460 with a claim that does not allow attorney fees, that plaintiff, if it prevails on the non-fee claim, is entitled to a determination on the other claim for the purpose of awarding counsel fees. In some instances, however, the claim with fees may involve a constitutional question which the courts are reluctant to resolve if the non-constitutional claim is dispositive. In such cases, if the claim for which fees may be awarded meets the \u201csubstantiality\u201d test, attorney\u2019s fees may be allowed even though the court declines to enter judgment for the plaintiff on that claim, so long as the plaintiff prevails on the non-fee claim arising out of a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact.\u201d\nThe substantiality doctrine of Hagans requires that petitioner establish a constitutional claim of sufficient substance to support jurisdiction in a federal court. A federal court can exercise pendant jurisdiction when: \u201c(a) there is a claim \u2018arising under [the] Constitution, the laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;\u2019 and (b) that claim, coupled with the pendent State claim, comprises but one constitutional \u2018case\u2019 that derives from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u201d In addition, a federal court cannot adjudicate claims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are \u201cso attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit.\u201d Put another way, the test to determine whether attorney\u2019s fees are appropriate in cases such as the instant case requires: \u201c(1) that the undecided constitutional claim and the adjudicated state claims arise out of a common set of facts; and (2) that the undecided constitutional claims must not be \u2018too insubstantial to confer subject matter jurisdiction in a federal court, meaning that those claims cannot be wholly insubstantial or obviously frivolous.\u2019 \u201d\nThe Plaintiff argues that it is due attorney\u2019s fees under both Wilmington Materials, Inc. v. Town of Middletown and Mirzakhalili v. Chagnon because the Plaintiff was the prevailing party in the litigation, having raised a substantial federal constitutional question that was avoided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the state law grounds that it had a vested right in the planned development. Wilmington Materials and Mirzakhalili are both well reasoned Chancery Court decisions and are squarely on point with the case at bar, thus, these cases are highly persuasive in this matter. In Wilmington Materials the court determined that the Town of Middletown was prohibited from enforcing an amendment to the zoning code against Wilmington Materials. The court did not then adjudicate the \u00a7 1983 claim because it had granted declaratory relief to Wilmington Materials solely on state law grounds. Nonetheless, the court determined that Wilmington Materials as the prevailing party was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988. Similarly, in Mirzakhalili the court completely resolved the plaintiffs claim on its state law estoppel claim. However, the court determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees even though the court concluded that the plaintiffs constitutional claim of deprivation of property \u201cbarely passed the non-stringent substantiality test that is a prerequisite to an award of fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.\u201d\nIn this case the Plaintiff presented a cognizable constitutional claim that was substantial enough to confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court. Additionally, the Plaintiffs undecided constitutional claim and its adjudicated State claim arise out of a common set of facts. Thus, the Plaintiffs constitutional claim sufficiently meets the \u201csubstantiality test\u201d to support a claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988. Although by the language of \u00a7 1988 an award of attorney\u2019s fees is discretionary, the courts have interpreted the statute to mandate an award \u201cunless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d Since the Plaintiff prevailed on its state law claim which circumvented a need for the Court to reach the constitutional issue, the Plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.\nIV. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, Plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees in this case. However, the Plaintiff has not presented evidence regarding the amount of fees to which it is entitled. Plaintiff shall file a sufficiently detailed affidavit as to the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to which Plaintiffs counsel is entitled. Upon receipt of the affidavit the State may respond, if it so chooses, as to the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees and any other issues raised by the Plaintiff.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n.

Specifically, in the original decision the Chancery Court determined that Wilmington Materials met the criteria under \u00a7 1988 for receiving attorney\u2019s fees. However, the court further determined that because the plaintiff was financially able to retain an attorney this was a \"special circumstance\u201d that would allow the court to deny it an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the matter with some instructions. On remand the Chancery Court determined that the ability to pay attorney\u2019s fees was not an appropriate special circumstance; thus, Wilmington Materials was entitled to and awarded attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988.\n.2000 WL 1724326, 2000 Del.

The court determined that Wilmington Materials had a vested right to utilize the property because it had \"incurred expenses in reasonable reliance of its belief that the Code permitted its intended use.\u201d Wilmington Materials I, 1993 WL 280411 at *2, 1993 Del.
