      {
        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant, Mary Finn, was awarded a judgment in the amount of $203,500 against appellee, City of Philadelphia, after appellant was injured when she fell on a grease-covered city sidewalk. The Commonwealth Court reversed the judgment due to governmental immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8541-8564, holding that the \u201csidewalk exception,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(7), did not pierce the city\u2019s immunity in this case. We granted allocatur to clarify precedents of this court relating to immunity, and to construe the language of the sidewalk exception to governmental immunity.\nThis case arises from the following background. After dark on the evening of December 24, 1987, appellant was walking on the sidewalk adjacent to city-owned property on Vine Street in Philadelphia, when she slipped on an accumulation of grease. Her fall caused serious injury, and she brought a personal injury action against the city. The city raised the defense of governmental immunity under the tort claims act, moving for summary judgment, which was denied, and the case was tried on stipulated facts. Judgment was entered for appellant in the stipulated amount of $203,500.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that an accumulation of grease on a sidewalk is not \u201ca dangerous condition of sidewalks,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(7), the statutory requisite to circumventing the city\u2019s governmental immunity and permitting tort liability.\nThe gist of appellant\u2019s argument is that the greasy condition of the sidewalk which caused her injury is embraced within the statutory exception to the governmental immunity created by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act; she argues that in the language of the act, the grease constituted a dangerous condition of the sidewalk. It would be erroneous, in this view, to focus on the word \u201cof,\u201d in contradistinction to the word \u201con\u201d; rather, the emphasis should be on \u201cdangerous condition\u201d and an analysis of what the legislature meant by that term. She relies heavily on Bendas v. Township of White Deer, 531 Pa. 180, 611 A.2d 1184 (1992).\nAppellee\u2019s argument emphasizes the principle that exceptions to governmental immunity must be strictly construed. The city stresses this court\u2019s holding in Snyder v. Harmon, 522 Pa. 424, 562 A.2d 307 (1989), to the effect that claims involving government property must establish an artificial condition or defect of the property itself, and that an actionable dangerous condition of government property must derive, originate from, or have as its source the property in question and may not arise from a source outside the property. The city argues that because grease does not derive or originate from the sidewalk, it is not a defect of the sidewalk itself; therefore, as a matter of law, grease cannot be considered a dangerous condition of the sidewalk. Hence it does not satisfy the statutory sidewalk exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity and the Commonwealth Court was correct in reversing the judgment against the city.\nIt is evident that this case turns on the meaning of the sidewalk exception to the tort claims act. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8642(b)(7) states:\n(b) Acts which may impose liability.\u2014 The following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency:\n(7) Sidewalks. \u2014 A dangerous condition of sidewalks within the rights-of-way of streets owned by the local agency, except that the claimant to recover must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition. When a local agency is liable for damages under this paragraph by reason of its power and authority to require installation and repair of sidewalks under the care, custody and control of other persons, the local agency shall be secondarily liable only and such other persons shall be primarily liable.\nTo apply this language to this case, we think it helpful to review the precedents which guide our decision.\nIn Mascaro v. Youth Study Center, 514 Pa. 351, 523 A.2d 1118 (1987), and Snyder v. Harmon, supra, we reviewed the origin of the legislation and the principles governing its interpretation. Mascaro provides the following history: In response to our abrogation of the judicially-created doctrine of governmental immunity in Ayala v. Philadelphia Bd. of Public Education, 453 Pa. 584, 305 A.2d 877 (1973), the legislature enacted the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8541-8564. The act legislatively raises the shield of governmental immunity against any damages on account of personal injury or property damage caused by any act of a local agency or employee thereof, except as otherwise provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542. Mascaro, 514 Pa. at 355, 523 A.2d at 1123. Snyder provides a strikingly similar history pertaining to sovereign immunity. In Mayle v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709 (1978), we abrogated the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In response, the legislature enacted the Sovereign Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8521 et seq. The act reinstated the doctrine of sovereign immunity, limiting the instances in which an individual may sue the Commonwealth to a set of specific situations enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522. Snyder, 522 Pa. at 431, 562 A.2d at 310-11.\nBecause the legislature\u2019s intent was to provide immunities, we have held that the exceptions to immunity must be strictly construed. Id. at 433, 434, 562 A.2d at 311, 312; Mascaro, 514 Pa. at 361, 523 A.2d at 1123; Kiley by Kiley v. City of Philadelphia, 537 Pa. 502, 506, 645 A.2d 184, 185-86 (1994). Moreover, this court has held that the two statutes dealing with governmental and sovereign immunities, viz., the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act and the Sovereign Immunity Act, are to be interpreted consistently, as they deal with indistinguishable subject matter. Id. at 507, 645 A.2d at 186; Crowell v. City of Philadelphia, 531 Pa. 400, 410 n. 8, 613 A.2d 1178, 1182 n. 8 (1992); Snyder, 522 Pa. at 435 n. 7, 562 A.2d at 312 n. 7.\nWithin those very general guidelines, this court has decided cases involving the real estate and sidewalk exceptions which provide more specific guidance for the question presented in this case, that is, whether an accumulation of grease on a sidewalk is a dangerous condition of the sidewalk. In Snyder v. Harmon, supra, we construed the words \u201c[a] dangerous condition of Commonwealth agency real estate\u201d as follows: \u201cThese key words indicate that a dangerous condition must derive, originate from or have as its source the Commonwealth realty.\u201d Snyder, 522 Pa. at 433, 562 A.2d at 311. \u201c[TJhere must be negligence which makes the real property itself unsafe for activities for which it is used.\u201d Id. at 434, 562 A.2d at 312. Masca-ro, supra, reiterated this rule: \u201cWe ... hold that the real estate exception can be applied only to those eases where it is alleged that the artificial condition or defect of the land itself causes the injury, not merely when it facilitates the injury by the acts of others, whose acts are outside the statute\u2019s scope of liability.\u201d 514 Pa. at 363, 523 A.2d at 1124 (emphasis in original). And again, \u2018We have consistently maintained our view that the focus of the negligent act involving a use of government owned or controlled land (including streets and sidewalks) must be the actual defect of the land itself and that the rule of immunity can be waived only in those cases where it is alleged that the artificial condition or defect of the land itself causes the injury.\u201d Kiley by Kiley, supra, 537 Pa. at 508, 645 A.2d at 187.\nThis interpretation is supported by the context of the \u201cdangerous condition of sidewalks\u201d requirement. The next sentence in the statute sheds light on what the legislature meant by \u201cdangerous condition of sidewalks.\u201d In distinguishing situations creating either primary or secondary liability of a governmental agency, the negligence of the agency relates to \u201cinstallation and repair of sidewalks.\u201d Installation and repair refer to the physical condition of the sidewalks themselves; by contrast, objects and substances upon sidewalks are not part of the physical condition of the sidewalks themselves. The language used in this section of the statute thus affords no basis to assert that foreign matter on sidewalks might result in governmental liability.\nThis much-litigated legislation has spawned other opinions which are less closely related to the present ease but have nevertheless been cited. Appellant argues that Bendas v. Township of White Deer, supra, would permit the city to be held liable in tort. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court noted apparent inconsistency between Bendas and Mascaro and Snyder, supra. We therefore review those decisions to clarify their holdings and their application to this case.\nIn Bendas, the court considered two issues: the first was \u201cwhether the Department [of Transportation] has a duty to make its highways safe for their intended purpose;\u201d the second was \u201cwhether the failure of the Department to exercise that duty is actionable under an exception to the Sovereign Immunity Act.\u201d 531 Pa. at 183, 611 A.2d at 1186. We cited Snyder, supra, in deciding that the Commonwealth agency had a clear duty to make its property safe for the activities for which it is regularly used. Id. The court found the second question more difficult, since a Commonwealth agency might breach a duty \u201cyet not be liable unless the breach is coincidental with an exception to the Act.\u201d Id. The exception applicable in Bendas was that of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4) which permits liability for a \u201cdangerous condition of ... real estate and sidewalks ... and highways....\u201d We held that when the Commonwealth agency or subdivision has a legal duty, the question of what is a dangerous condition is one of fact which must be answered by the jury, noting that a court is not precluded from entering judgment for the Commonwealth agency or subdivision when the facts establish as a matter of law that a dangerous condition did not exist. Id. at 185 n. 6, 611 A.2d at 1187 n. 6.\nMascaro involved a detainee at the defendant youth detention center who had a history of violent criminal assaults, then escaped and terrorized the Mascaro family, with tragic results. The Mascaros sued the political subdivision under the real estate exception to the governmental immunity act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(3), alleging negligent maintenance of the detention center which permitted the detainee to escape. The court held that the real estate exception \u201ccan be applied only to those eases where it is alleged that the artificial defect of the land itself causes the injury, not merely when it facilitates the injury by the acts of others, whose acts are outside the statute\u2019s scope of liability.\u201d 514 Pa. at 363, 523 A.2d at 1124. Thus, Mascaro is an example of a situation in which the political subdivision was not liable as a matter of law because the dangerous condition of the real estate itself did not cause the injury.\nSnyder was a ease in which travellers\u2019 falls from the berm of a Commonwealth highway into a mine resulted in injuries and death, allegedly due to the Commonwealth agency\u2019s negligent failure to maintain a safe roadway and to provide adequate notice of a dangerous condition; the plaintiffs relied on the real estate exception to the Sovereign Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4). The court held that the statutory language unambiguously required that \u201ca dangerous condition must derive, originate from or have as its source the Commonwealth realty,\u201d 522 Pa. at 433, 562 A.2d at 311; that \u201cthere must be negligence which makes the real property itself unsafe for activities for which it is used,\u201d id. at 434, 562 A.2d at 312; and that the real estate exception to the rule of immunity applies only when \u201cit is alleged that the artificial condition or defect of the land itself causes an injury to occur,\u201d id. at 434-35, 562 A.2d at 312.\nIn Ambacher v. Penrose, 92 Pa.Cmwlth. 401, 403-04, 499 A.2d 716, 717 (1985), and Ziccardi v. School District of Philadelphia, 91 Pa.Cmwlth. 595, 599, 498 A.2d 452, 454 (1985), the Commonwealth Court correctly applied this rule in determining that neither a wire fence which fell on a sidewalk nor a criminal assault on a city sidewalk was a dangerous condition \u201cof the sidewalk.\u201d Recent decisions of the Commonwealth Court indicate that that tribunal now consistently applies the rule in this way. In DeLuca v. School District of Philadelphia, 654 A.2d 29 (Pa.Cmwlth.1994), the court reviewed the claim of a student injured in a fall on a school sidewalk. The fall was caused by milk which had seeped from a trash bag placed next to the sidewalk by school employees and then frozen. The court held: \u201cBecause milk that has leaked onto a concrete pavement does not constitute a defect of the pavement itself, ... the School District was not liable under [42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7] 8542(b)(3) for the DeLucas\u2019 injuries.\u201d Id. at -, 654 A.2d at 31. In Shedrick v. William Penn School District, 654 A.2d 163 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995), the court reviewed a similar claim by a person injured when she fell in a high school where rainwater tracked indoors had caused the terrazzo floors to become slippery. She fell on a portion of the building\u2019s floor not covered by mats although the custodian had mopped and laid mats in an attempt to keep the floors dry. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court because the \u201crainwater on the floor of the high school neither derived nor originated from the School District\u2019s real property, and no evidence was offered to establish that the floor itself was defective.\u201d Id. at-, 654 A.2d at 165.\nThe common theme of all these cases is that liability depends, first, on the legal determination that an injury was caused by a condition of government realty itself, deriving, originating from, or having the realty as its source, and, only then, the factual determination that the condition was dangerous.\nWhat is necessary, therefore, to pierce the Commonwealth agency\u2019s immunity is proof of a defect of the sidewalk itself. Such proof might include an improperly designed sidewalk, an improperly constructed sidewalk, or a badly maintained, deteriorating, crumbling sidewalk. Here, however, we have no such allegation or proof. We have a perfectly designed and constructed sidewalk, undamaged, upon which an unidentified individual or individuals deposited a foreign substance which caused appellant\u2019s injury. In the terms of Snyder, supra, the dangerous condition did not derive, originate from or have as its source the sidewalk. In the language of the statutory exception to governmental immunity, the dangerous condition was on the sidewalk, not of the sidewalk, and thus is insufficient to create liability in the city.\nWe hold, therefore, that the Commonwealth Court correctly interpreted and applied the statute of governmental immunity, and thus affirm the judgment of the court.\nJudgment affirmed.\nZAPPALA and CAPPY, JJ., file a dissenting opinion.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.",

        "text": "GAPPY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent.\nOn December 24, 1987 Mary Finn slipped and seriously injured herself on a sidewalk owned and maintained by the City of Philadelphia (\u201cCity\u201d). This sidewalk, located in the rear of the Philadelphia Juvenile Courthouse, was covered with grease as a result of the City\u2019s regularly and improperly permitting individuals to park motor vehicles on the sidewalk. In my opinion, the trial court reasonably found that City personnel at the courthouse knew or should have known of this dangerous condition, which they had sought to eliminate by covering a portion of the sidewalk with a rug. Under these circumstances, the trial court also reasonably found that Ms. Finn\u2019s injuries resulted from a \u201cdangerous condition of sidewalks within the rights-of-way of streets owned by the local agency.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. 8542(b)(7).\nNevertheless, the Majority herein concludes that the City is immune from liability for Ms. Finn\u2019s injuries, because it believes that the dangerous condition of the sidewalk found to exist by the trial court does not fall within the \u201csidewalks\u201d exception to the immunity afforded the City through the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542 et seq.. In reaching this conclusion, the Majority resorts to adoption of a hollow distinction \u2014 that the unsafe condition of the sidewalk herein was not \u201cof\u2019 the sidewalk, but simply \u201con\u201d the sidewalk, because the sidewalk was \u201cperfectly designed and constructed and undamaged.\u201d Maj. Op. at p. 1346. The Majority reasons that the Legislature intended to retain liability only in situations involving circumstances such as \u201can improperly designed sidewalk, an improperly constructed sidewalk, or a badly maintained, deteriorating, crumbling sidewalk.\u201d Id. In my opinion, this proposition is not supported by a plain reading of the \u201csidewalks\u201d exception, and the obvious intention of the Legislature to generally retain governmental liability in situations involving injuries suffered by individuals while using governmental real property, including sidewalks, where the real property constitutes a dangerous condition of which the political subdivision possesses actual or constructive notice.\nThe \u201csidewalk exception,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(7), quite simply provides that political subdivisions such as the City herein may be subject to liability for a \u201cdangerous condition of sidewalks within the rights-of-way of streets owned by the local agency.\u201d In my opinion, the only limitation on the application thereof stems from the Legislature\u2019s requirements that the dangerous condition result in reasonably foreseeable injury and that the City have, or be reasonably charged with, notice of the dangerous condition. Thus, I see the Majority\u2019s attempt to further limit the applicability of this exception to be erroneous.\nThe Majority believes that sufficient support for this proposition exists by virtue of this Court\u2019s decision in Snyder v. Harmon, 522 Pa. 424, 562 A.2d 307 (1989) wherein it was stated that sovereign immunity is waived only \u201cwhere it is alleged that the artificial condition or defect of the land itself causes an injury to occur.\u201d Id. at 435, 562 A.2d at 312. However, the facts of Snyder are clearly distinguishable from this case, as Snyder involved injuries sustained on real property that was not owned by the Commonwealth, and accordingly cannot be relied upon for the proposition espoused by the majority. Clearly, since in Snyder the plaintiff was not injured on Commonwealth property, the expansive reading given to the above-quoted statement by the Majority is without foundation. For the same reasons, the Majority\u2019s reliance upon Mascaro v. Youth Study Center, 514 Pa. 351, 523 A.2d 1118 (1987) is misplaced, where the injuries inflicted by an escaped prisoner did not occur on Commonwealth realty, and were vastly removed from the dangerous condition that fostered the prisoner\u2019s escape.\nPursuant to Snyder and Masearo, and their progeny, the focus is more properly directed away from result-oriented analysis of what constitutes the sidewalk \u201citself\u2019 in favor of a determination of whether the City\u2019s \u201csidewalk was safe for the activities for which the property is regularly used, intended to be used or reasonably foreseen to be used.\u201d Snyder, 522 Pa. at 435, 562 A.2d at 312; Bendas v. Township of White Deer, 531 Pa. 180, 183, 611 A.2d 1184, 1186 (1992). By enacting the sidewalks exception, the Legislature intended to require political subdivisions to design, construct and maintain their sidewalks in a safe condition. Clearly, the Legislature could not have intended to hold the City to such a duty with regard to its sidewalks without intending it to be hable for injuries resulting from a breach of such duty. Once again, all that is required for the exception to apply is a dangerous condition of the sidewalk of which the City possessed actual or constructive notice, and I conclude that few citizens of this Commonwealth would agree that grease on a sidewalk does not, and can never, constitute a dangerous condition of the sidewalk.\nThis proposition is further borne out by the Majority\u2019s conclusion that piercing the Commonwealth agency\u2019s immunity is warranted only upon proof of things such as the existence of an \u201cimproperly designed sidewalk, and improperly constructed sidewalk, or a badly maintained, deteriorating, crumbling sidewalk.\u201d Maj. Op. at p. 1346. Obviously, as a practical matter, a sidewalk cannot act in a negligent manner. Rather, it is conduct attributable to the political subdivision that is being subject to scrutiny.\nUnquestionably, the City\u2019s potential liability for a badly deteriorating sidewalk would arise from the negligence of the City in failing to maintain the sidewalk. Similarly, the City\u2019s potential liability for a sidewalk that is dangerous by virtue of defective design or construction would result from the negligence of the individuals who created the defective design or performed the defective construction for the City. Given this, I cannot comprehend how the Majority can logically conclude that the negligence of the City in depositing the grease and/or in failing to correct the dangerous condition it knew about somehow compels a different result.\nThe dangerous repercussions of the Majority\u2019s interpretation of the sidewalk exception are already being felt throughout the Commonwealth. During the pendency of this particular appeal the Commonwealth Court rendered a decision in the case of McRae v. School District of Philadelphia, 660 A.2d 209 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995). The Plaintiff in that case slipped and fell on hills and ridges of ice remaining on the improperly maintained sidewalk abutting the McMichael School in Philadelphia. The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings for the school district and the Commonwealth Court affirmed. The Commonwealth Court, relying upon its earlier opinion in Finn, (now being affirmed by the Majority) determined that snow and ice are not defects emanating from the real estate itself; therefore liability does not attach. The impact of this absurd conclusion that the defect must emanate from the sidewalk itself is glaringly obvious when taken to such an absurd extreme as was done by the McRae decision. Do we really want to send a message to our school districts that they no longer need to carefully remove the snow and ice from their sidewalks?\nI cannot comprehend how the Majority can justify its decision, in light of such absurd results, to afford immunity in situations of active negligence, such as where the City itself deposits the grease, where the same would not be true in circumstances involving passive negligence, such as where the City simply permits a sidewalk to crumble.\nBecause this particular sidewalk \u201citself,\u201d was, as reasonably found by the trier of fact, rendered dangerous by the presence of the grease thereon, I respectfully but emphatically dissent.\n.\nSidewalks. \u2014 A dangerous condition of sidewalks within the rights-of-way of streets owned by the local agency, except that the claimant to recover must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition. When a local agency is liable for damages under this paragraph by reason of its power and authority to require installation and repair of sidewalks under the care, custody and control of other persons, the local agency shall be secondarily liable only and such other persons shall be primarily liable.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(7) (emphasis added).\n. I note that in Kiley v. City of Philadelphia, 537 Pa. 502, 645 A.2d 184 (1994), I similarly disagreed with the manner in which the Majority therein chose to expand the immunity of the City of Philadelphia in connection with the maintenance of its sidewalks. While my dissent in Kiley addressed numerous other shortcomings contained in the majority opinion therein, I believe the simple facts of the matter sub judice sufficiently expose the frailty of the majority's approach to these situations.",
