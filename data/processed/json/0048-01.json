        "text": "DANA, Justice.\nOn December 2, 1990, at approximately 4:35 a.m., the plaintiff Laura Dana, was arrested in Baileyville for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI). Approximately one hour and fifteen minute's later, Dana was again arrested for OUI in. Indian Township. On the date of her arrest, Dana had one prior conviction for OUI dating back to March 1989. On Dana\u2019s guilty plea to two charges of OUI arising out of the December 1990 arrests, the Superior Court (Sils-by, J.) suspended her license for two one-year terms to run concurrently. Subsequently the Secretary of State administratively extended Dana\u2019s suspension for one additional year. Pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. 80C, Dana sought review of this decision by the Superior Court (Alexander, J.) which affirmed the decision of the Secretary of State. On Dana\u2019s appeal, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.\n29 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1312-D(1) (Pamph. 1992), authorizing the Secretary to suspend the license of a person convicted of OUI, provides that \u201cif the court fails to suspend the license ... of any person convicted under section 1312-B ... the Secretary of State shall suspend those rights for the period specified in section 1312-B_\u201d Section 1312-B(2) provides in relevant part:\nC. In the case of a person having one previous conviction of [OUI] ... within a 6-year period ... the court shall suspend the defendant\u2019s license ... to operate ... a motor vehicle ... for a period of one year....\nD. In the case of a person having 2 or more previous convictions of [OUI] ... within a 6-year period ... the court shall suspend the defendant\u2019s license ... to operate ... a motor vehicle ... for a period of two years_\nF. For purposes of this section, a prior conviction has occurred within the 6-year period provided if the date of the docket entry by the clerk of a judgment of conviction or adjudication is six years or less from the date of the new conduct which is penalized or for which the penalty is or may be enhanced.\n29 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1312-B(2)(C), (D), (F) (Pamph.1992) (emphasis added).\nThe critical language of section 1312-B(2)(C) and (D) is \u201cone previous conviction\u201d and \u201c2 or more previous convictions.\u201d The only question for us is previous to what? That question is answered in section 1312-B(2)(F), i.e., previous to \u201cthe date of the new conduct.\u201d On the date of the new conduct Dana had only one previous conviction.\nThe Secretary of State concedes that \u201cit is undisputed that prior to December 2, 1990, Dana had one prior OUI conviction within the prior six years\u201d and thus that \u201cthe sentencing court was constrained by section 1312-B(2)(F) from imposing an enhanced license suspension on her.\u201d He argues, however, that \u201cno such constraint hinders the Secretary of State\u2019s authority under 1312-D(1)\u201d citing our decision in Benedix v. Secretary of State, 603 A.2d 473, 475 (Me.1992), in support of his novel proposition. We reject the Secretary\u2019s argument.\nThe Secretary\u2019s power to suspend the license of a person convicted of OUI only comes into play \u201c(i)f the court fails to suspend the license of any person convicted under section 1312-B.\u201d The Secretary of State is then empowered to \u201csuspend ... for the period specified in section 1312-B.\u201d Nothing in Benedix v. Secretary of State can be construed to give the Secretary the authority to impose a suspension greater than that mandated by section 1312-B. On the contrary, in Benedix we said that \u201csection 1312-D(1) recognizes the Secretary\u2019s back-up authority ... to enter the license suspension that according to the Secretary\u2019s records is statutorily mandated by section 1312-B\u201d and that \u201c[s]ection 1312-D(l) ... requires the Secretary to enter the exact suspension that ... is required by the OUI statutes.\u201d Id. at 474-75.\nThe entry is:\nJudgment vacated.\nRemanded to the Superior Court with instruction to vacate the decision of the Secretary of State.\nROBERTS, GLASSMAN and RUDMAN, JJ., concur.",

        "text": "COLLINS, J.,\nwith whom WATHEN, C.J., joins, dissenting.\nFor the reasons cited by the Court, I respectfully dissent.\nWhile I concede that the Court\u2019s literal and formalistic reading of the pertinent statutory sections may in fact be accurate, I cannot join in the opinion that, in my view, does violence to our well-established rule of effectuating the intent of the Legislature.\nThe legislative intent behind the OUI statutes is apparent. The progressively longer periods of license suspension mandated by the Legislature for each additional OUI conviction graphically evince the Legislature\u2019s intent to suspend an OUI convict\u2019s license for a period of time commensurate with the number of convictions. See 29 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1312-B (Pamph.1992). Notwithstanding the Legislature\u2019s clear intent, however, it does not appear that the Legislature contemplated the vagaries that would arise in connection with sentencing and administrative license suspension proceedings when the courts and the Secretary were confronted with a repeat OUI offender whose repeated \u201cnew conduct\u201d was relatively contemporaneous.\nOver the past 15 years the legislature has worked and reworked the OUI statutes at nearly every session in a consistent attempt to stop the lethal problem of drunken drivers....\nBenedix v. Secretary of State, 603 A.2d 473, 475 (Me.1992).\n\u201cWhen it is clear that the Legislature enacted specific legislation to remedy an existing special problem, social or otherwise, such statutory enactment must be construed so as to promote the policy consideration which brought about the Legislature\u2019s action. Such construction shall be adopted as will best curb the problem which the Legislature sought to suppress.\u201d Id. at 473 (quoting Waddell v. Briggs, 381 A.2d 1132, 1135 (Me.1978)); see also State v. Niles, 585 A.2d 181, 182 (Me.1990) (once purpose of statute is ascertained, we should give effect to it, avoiding results that are absurd, inconsistent, unreasonable or illogical).\nIn light of the ambiguity of the statutory language and the fact that the Court\u2019s formalistic reading flies in the face of the Legislature\u2019s intent, I would read \u00a7 1312-B(2)(F) literally to require that the date of the docket entry evidencing the prior adjudication be within six years from the time of the new conduct. Such a reading would effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent and, in this case, would have allowed the Secretary of State to impose the suspension that the Legislature intended.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.",
