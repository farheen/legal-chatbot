Such an order is interlocutory and therefore not appealable. Giarrusso v. Corrigan, 108 R.I. 471, 276 A.2d 750 (1971).\nAccordingly, treating defendant\u2019s motion for affirmance as a motion to dismiss the appeal as premature, the said motion to dismiss is hereby granted.\nMURRAY and SHEA, JJ., did not participate.",
