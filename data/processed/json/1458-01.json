        "text": "OPINION\nBy the Court,\nHardesty, J.:\nUnder Nevada\u2019s coercion statute, NRS 207.190, commission of an act of coercion using physical force, or using an immediate threat of physical force, constitutes a felony. Coercion committed without either of these components is a gross misdemeanor. In this appeal, we consider which test should be applied to determine if a threat is immediate, future, or incapable of being performed. To determine whether a defendant is criminally liable for a felony or for a gross misdemeanor under NRS 207.190, we conclude that the viewpoint of a reasonable person facing the same threat should be the focus of the inquiry. In doing so, we extend our previous holding in Deshler v. State.\nHowever, the jury instructions were erroneous because the district court did not instruct the jury to apply the reasonable person test. This error was not harmless, and it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found Santana guilty of felony coercion had it received the proper instructions. For these reasons, we reverse Santana\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial. We also note that while the jury can and should consider the testimony of victims, the jury remains responsible for determining whether a threat is immediate, future, or incapable of being performed.\nFACTS\nAppellant Vincent Mark Santana was incarcerated at the Clark County Detention Center during the summer of 2002. While he was there, Santana placed random phone calls to several women and children in southern California. Each phone call began with a recording, which explained that the call was a collect call from the Clark County Detention Center. The recipient of the phone call was then invited to accept or decline the call. Each victim in this case accepted.\nOnce Santana heard the victim accept the call, he informed her that the recording was a joke and then initiated a friendly conversation. Soon after, Santana told the victim that he was near her location, with a weapon, and that he would harm her if she did not participate in a sexual conversation with him.\nAn indictment was filed charging Santana with 19 counts of coercion under NRS 207.190. Subsequently, a superseding indictment was filed to include all 19 counts of coercion as well as Santana\u2019s prior felony convictions. Many of the victims in the present case testified during the jury trial, but some did not.\nUltimately, the jury found Santana guilty on 19 counts of felony coercion. At sentencing, the district court considered Santana\u2019s prior felony convictions and adjudicated Santana as a habitual criminal pursuant to NRS 207.010. During sentencing, the State suggested that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole was appropriate for those counts where the victims testified, but that a sentence of life with the possibility of parole would be appropriate for those counts where the victims did not testify. The district court sentenced Santana to a life sentence on each of the 19 counts. The final sentence amounted to a total of 5 consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole, while the remaining life terms were imposed to run concurrently. Santana now appeals.\nDISCUSSION\nWe first decide which viewpoint should be examined when determining whether a defendant is liable for felony coercion under NRS 207.190. Santana argues that an objective viewpoint should control, based on our decision in Deshler. Because Santana was incarcerated when he made the phone calls and could not execute his threats, he argues that, under an objective standard, he could not have violated NRS 207.190. According to Santana, this means that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for felony coercion. We then determine that the jury instructions were erroneous because they did not require the jury to apply a reasonable person analysis, which resulted in nonharmless error.\nCoercion\nThe coercion statute, NRS 207.190(1), provides that it is unlawful for any person to attempt to intimidate another by threats of force or to threaten to use violence or inflict injury upon another with the intent to compel the other person to do or abstain from doing an act that the person has the right to do or abstain from doing. The statute further provides that \u201c[wjhere physical force or the immediate threat of physical force is used,\u201d the offense is a felony, but \u201c[wjhere no physical force or immediate threat of physical force is used,\u201d the offense is a misdemeanor. Santana argues that, under Deshler, if a defendant lacks the present capacity or apparent ability to immediately execute his threats, then those threats are necessarily threats of future harm, not immediate harm. Since Santana lacked the present ability to carry out his threats because he was incarcerated, he argues that they were threats of future harm and therefore not subject to the statute. We disagree in part.\nIn Deshler, police responded to a bar fight involving Deshler and several patrons who believed that he had stolen the wallet of a fellow patron. Finding Deshler bloodied and perhaps injured, the police called for paramedics. Deshler verbally abused and fought with the police both as they arrested him and afterwards. He also violently resisted the paramedics when they tried to load him into the ambulance.\nOne of the officers, Deputy Crawford, helped the paramedics load Deshler into the ambulance and rode with Deshler to the hospital. Deshler repeatedly threatened Deputy Crawford and his family \u201cin numerous and specific ways,\u201d including threats of lethal harm. As this occurred, Deshler was strapped to a gurney but attempting to free himself. When Deshler broke free of the leg restraints, Deputy Crawford placed his knees on Deshler to control him. Deputy Crawford maintained his position until the ambulance reached the hospital. Deshler never completely broke free of the restraints.\n,Deshler was convicted of three felonies, including intimidation of a public officer based on his threats against Deputy Crawford. This court reversed that conviction. The statute in question in Deshler \u2014 NRS 199.300 \u2014 is similar to NRS 207.190 in that the level of the offense depended on whether physical force or the immediate threat of such force was used. \u201cAll of Deshler\u2019s threats, though severe and credible, were couched in future terms.\u201d Likewise, the record did not reveal any use of physical force or any realistic immediate threat against Deputy Crawford. Moreover, the court in Deshler observed that Deputy Crawford was able to immobilize and control Deshler without fear of physical harm. Consequently, Deshler did not have the \u201cpresent capacity\u201d or \u201capparent ability\u201d to carry out his threats, which a reasonable person facing the same threat could determine, necessarily making Deshler\u2019s comments threats of future and not immediate harm.\nIn addressing Deshler\u2019s apparent ability to execute his threats against Deputy Crawford, this court did not expressly articulate which viewpoint should be used to determine liability for felony coercion. However, the term \u201capparent ability\u201d necessarily implicates the defendant\u2019s ability to carry out his threats to the extent that the ability is apparent to some viewpoint. NRS 207.190\u2019s requirement of an \u201cimmediate threat of physical force\u201d implicates the same viewpoint concern because it requires the trier of fact to determine the immediacy of the threat. This, in turn, requires the jury to ascertain the viewpoint of one facing the same threat. We therefore extend Deshler to conclude that in determining whether a defendant has made an immediate threat of physical force under NRS 207.190, the inquiry must focus on the viewpoint of a reasonable person. Depending on that viewpoint, an immediate threat of physical force may exist even where the defendant is not presently able to carry out the threat. We add that while the jury can and should consider the testimony of victims, the jury remains responsible for determining whether the threat was immediate, fixture, or incapable of being performed.\nJury instructions\nThe district court did not instruct the jury to apply the reasonable person test. In fact, the jury was not instructed to analyze NRS 207.190 from any particular viewpoint. The district court\u2019s jury instructions instead echoed the language of NRS 207.190(2)(a)-(b): \u201c[i]n deciding whether a person has committed the crime of Coercion, you must also necessarily decide the type of Coercion committed, to wit: (1) Coercion committed by the use of physical force; or (2) Coercion committed by the use of an immediate threat of physical force, or (3) Coercion committed without any physical force or the immediate threat of physical force.\u201d\nThis court reviews the \u201cgiving of erroneous jury instructions under a harmless error analysis.\u201d An error is harmless if it is \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u201d\nThe viewpoint by which the jury analyzes NRS 207.190 can determine whether the defendant is found guilty of a gross misdemeanor or a felony. Under NRS 207.190, the immediacy of the threat distinguishes felony coercion from gross misdemeanor coercion. Under a more objective standard, such as the reasonable person test, the jury could decide the immediacy of the threat based on how a reasonable person facing the same threat would perceive that threat. Applying the reasonable person test, a defendant would face a uniform standard as the jury determines whether the defendant is guilty of a felony or a gross misdemeanor. Under a subjective standard, however, the jury could decide the immediacy of the threat based on how the actual victims perceived the threat. Using this standard, whether a defendant is found guilty of a felony or a gross misdemeanor will depend on the potentially varying perceptions of individual victims. This creates a troublesome legal inconsistency that in turn could yield unfair results.\nThe jury should have been instructed to apply a reasonable person analysis. Since the district court did not give this instruction, the jury instructions were erroneous. Because we do not know what the jury would have found in terms of the reasonable person test, it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found Santana guilty of felony coercion absent the error. For these reasons, Santana\u2019s convictions must be reversed and remanded for a new trial.\nCONCLUSION\nWe extend our holding in Deshler and conclude that in determining whether there has been an immediate threat of physical force under NRS 207.190, a reasonable person\u2019s viewpoint should be the focus of the inquiry. We also note that while the jury can and should consider the victims\u2019 testimony, the jury remains responsible for determining whether the threat was immediate, future, or incapable of being performed. Because the jury was not instructed to apply the reasonable person test in the present case, the jury instructions were erroneous and the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse Santana\u2019s convictions and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\nBecker, Maupin, Gibbons, Douglas and Parraguirre, JJ., concur.\n106 Nev. 253, 256, 790 P.2d 1001, 1003 (1990) (stating that where the defendant lacked the present capacity or apparent ability to carry out his threats, he could not have been guilty of felony intimidation of a public officer).\nThe prior felony convictions were on the following charges: (1) failure of a convicted sex offender to change his address; (2) coercion; (3) sexual battery; (4) false imprisonment; (5) rape, robbery, and kidnapping; and (6) assault with intent to rape.\nThe judgment of conviction' incorrectly states that Santana entered a plea of guilty.\nNRS 207.190(2).\n106 Nev. at 254, 790 P.2d at 1002.\nId.\nId. at 255, 790 P.2d at 1002.\nId. at 253-54, 790 P.2d at 1001.\nId. at 254, 790 P.2d at 1001.\nThe operative statute in Deshler was NRS 199.300. The statute has since been amended and no longer appears as it was quoted in Deshler. See Deshler, 106 Nev. at 256, 790 P.2d at 1003. However, NRS 199.300 still refers to the use of \u201cphysical force or the immediate threat of such force\u201d in classifying the intimidation of a public officer as a felony or gross misdemeanor.\nDeshler, 106 Nev. at 256, 790 P.2d at 1003.\nId.\nId.\nWe have previously adopted the reasonable person test in other criminal contexts.

        "text": "Rose, C. J.,\nconcurring:\nI concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that NRS 207.190 must be examined under an objective standard and in its reversal of Santana\u2019s convictions based on the failure to properly instruct the jury. However, I write separately to address the sentence Santana received following his first trial, and I take this last opportunity to object to a grave deficiency in this court\u2019s criminal jurisprudence that I have criticized many times during my tenure on this court\u2014 this court\u2019s continual refusal to review criminal sentences for excessiveness.\nIn most criminal cases, after reviewing all of the district courts\u2019 other determinations before and after trial for an abuse of discretion or error, this court then merely reiterates, with slight variation, the same very basic paragraph to tersely dismiss defendants\u2019 challenges to their sentences. This canned language is as follows:\nThe Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids [an] extreme sentence[ ] that [is] grossly disproportionate to the crime. Despite its harshness, [a] sentence within the statutory limits is not cruel and unusual punishment unless the statute fixing punishment is unconstitutional or the sentence is so unreasonably disproportionate to the offense as to shock the conscience.\nUse of this canned language is disturbing because, in doing so, this court pays mere lip service to the propriety of the review of defendants\u2019 sentences, which is the most important part of a criminal proceeding. I have previously addressed, in great depth, the many problems with this court\u2019s refusal to review sentences for excessiveness. Therefore, I do not repeat that discussion here, but refer instead to my dissent in Sims v. State and voice my continuing objection to this injustice.\nThe instant case illustrates what is wrong with this system. Santana was convicted of nineteen counts of felony coercion and was adjudicated a habitual criminal. The district court sentenced Santana to a total of nineteen life sentences, with five consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole and fourteen concurrent life terms. I do not disagree that Santana is a habitual criminal, but the imposition of five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for making sexually explicit telephone calls while incarcerated and physically unable to actually carry out any action described during the telephone calls is patently excessive and was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. Although Santana\u2019s punishment is within the statutory limit, this does not mean that his sentence is automatically just and not excessive. I urge this court in the future to reconsider its refusal to review criminal sentences for excessiveness and to provide criminal defendants with the opportunity to have the most important aspect of their criminal cases examined on appeal.\nSee, e.g., Cameron v.
