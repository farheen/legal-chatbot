        "text": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThis matter came before the Supreme Court on November 16,1994, pursuant to an order directing the plaintiffs to appear and show cause why their appeal should not be summarily denied and dismissed. In this case the plaintiffs, Samuel and Evelyn Bres-niek, appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s denial of their motion to amend their complaint and the granting of the motion to dismiss of the defendants, Aron and Tsilya Baskin. After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and after hearing their counsel in oral argument, this court concludes that cause has not been shown. The issues raised in this appeal will be considered at this time.\nIn September 1988 plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants, alleging that after cutting down trees and shrubs belonging to plaintiffs, defendants improperly erected a chainlink fence that encroaches approximately two feet onto plaintiffs\u2019 property. The plaintiffs alleged trespass, willful destruction of trees and shrubbery, conversion of approximately two feet of plaintiffs\u2019 property, and wrongful erection of the chainlink fence. In July 1992, when the matter was being reviewed for trial, defendants challenged plaintiffs\u2019 right to proceed to trial on an adverse-possession claim. The defendants argue that nothing in \u201cthe complaint * * * set forth a count or any language which would be fair and reasonable notice to the defendants that a count for adverse possession was being proffered and produced for the court\u2019s consideration.\u201d\nLong after the complaint had been filed, plaintiffs and defendants had surveys done that established that the fence in question had been erected on defendants\u2019 property. The plaintiffs conceded that the boundary line was no longer in dispute in light of the surveyors\u2019 reports but that they should be allowed to proceed on a claim of adverse possession. The trial justice determined that a fair reading of the complaint did not put defendants on notice that they would have to defend against a claim of adverse possession. The judge also observed that a party is \u201cjudicially bound by [its] pleadings, and that the allegations therein are conclusive against the pleader.\u201d\nThe trial justice further pointed out that plaintiffs had not formally moved to amend their complaint. He observed that despite the liberal granting of amendments, pursuant to Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, he would have been obliged to deny such a motion on the basis of the prejudice to defendants at that late date.\nAt that point the trial justice granted defendants\u2019 in-court motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs then moved to amend their complaint in open court, which motion the trial justice denied, relying on his earlier ruling.\nUnder Rhode Island law, Rule 8 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure is a liberal-pleading rule. Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 848 (R.I.1992). Although a plaintiff is not obligated to \u201cset out the precise legal theory upon which his or her claim is based,\u201d he or she must provide \u201cthe opposing party fair and adequate notice of the type of claim being asserted.\u201d Id. This court has further held that \u201cparties to an action are judicially bound by their pleadings therein and that the allegations are conclusive as against the pleader.\u201d Ogden v. Rabinowitz, 86 R.I. 294, 300, 134 A.2d 416, 419 (1957).\nWe conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not put defendants on fair notice of an adverse-possession claim. The plaintiffs failed to use the well-known language of the adverse-possession statute, G.L.1956 (1984 Reenactment) \u00a7 34-7-1, to set forth that plaintiffs\u2019 possession was \u201c \u2018actual, open, notorious, hostile, under claim of right, continuous, and exclusive.\u2019 \u201d Locke v. O\u2019Brien, 610 A.2d 552, 555 (R.I.1992).\nIt is well established that although Rule-15 amendments are liberally granted, \u201cthe decision about whether to permit a party to amend his or her pleading is one that is left exclusively to the sound discretion of the trial justice and [this court] shall not disturb that decision unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d Normandin v. Levine, 621 A.2d 713, 715 (R.I.1993). In Vincent v. Musone, 572 A.2d 280, 283 (R.I.1990), we held that a motion to amend filed on the day of trial, five years after the original complaint had been filed, was prejudicial and the trial justice should not have granted the motion to amend.\nFor all these reasons the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is denied and dismissed, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, and the papers of the case are remanded to the Superior Court.\nWEISBERGER, Acting Chief Justice, did not participate.",
