        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nEarly on the morning of April 25, 1993, after consuming a considerable amount of alcohol throughout the night, respondent, Michael J. Hoare, caused the death of a young man when, while driving the wrong direction on an interstate highway, he collided with the young man\u2019s car. Respondent was convicted by a jury in St. Clair County, Illinois, of aggravated reckless homicide, and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and forty months of probation. He was also ordered to perform forty hours of community service each month during his probation.\nRespondent promptly reported his conviction to Bar Counsel. Bar Counsel filed a certified copy of respondent\u2019s sentencing order, and, on July 31, 1996, this court temporarily suspended respondent pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 10(c). We directed the Board on Professional Responsibility (\u201cBoard\u201d) to institute a formal proceeding to determine the nature of the final discipline to be imposed and, specifically, to decide whether respondent\u2019s crime involved moral turpitude.\nWhile the matter was proceeding before the Board, Bar Counsel informed this court that respondent had been disbarred by the Supreme Court of Missouri, had been suspended for two years by the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and had been disbarred by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which disbarment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Accordingly, we directed the Board to recommend whether, and what type of, reciprocal discipline should be imposed.\nOn October 19, 1998, the Board filed a report and recommendation. The Board, in accord with the Hearing Committee, found that aggravated reckless homicide, a felony, is a \u201cserious crime\u201d within the meaning of D.C.App. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 10(b), but that respondent\u2019s conduct did not involve moral turpitude, nor violate Rule 8.4(b) of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct. The sanction recommended by the Board is a two-year suspension nunc pro tunc to the date respondent filed his affidavit pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14(g). Because the Hearing Committee conducted a full de novo proceeding, the Board recommends that the reciprocal proceedings be dismissed as moot. Bar Counsel and respondent have both informed the court that they take no exception to the Board\u2019s report and recommendation.\nWe accept the Board\u2019s findings; neither Bar Counsel nor respondent has filed exceptions to them. In so doing, we express no opinion on the Board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s conduct did not involve moral turpitude.\nWe give similar deference to the Board\u2019s recommended sanction. Generally, we will impose the sanction recommended by the Board \u201cunless to do so would foster a tendency toward inconsistent dispositions for comparable conduct or would otherwise be unwarranted.\u201d Id. The question of an appropriate sanction in this case is one of first impression in this jurisdiction. Because respondent has not filed any exceptions to the Board\u2019s report and recommendation, this court\u2019s already considerable deference to the Board\u2019s determination of an appropriate sanction is enhanced. D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 9(g)(2); In re Delaney, 697 A.2d 1212, 1214 (D.C.1997). Thus, we adopt the sanction recommended by the Board. We make no judgment about what an appropriate sanction might be if respondent or Bar Counsel had contested the sanction recommended by the Board. We note that other jurisdictions have issued sanctions ranging from suspension to disbarment in similar cases. See, e.g., In re Horwitz, 180 Ariz. 20, 881 P.2d 352 (1994) (en banc) (disbarment); Kentucky Bar Ass\u2019n v. Jones, 759 S.W.2d 61 (Ky.1988) (two-year suspension); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Michaels, 38 Ohio St.3d 248, 527 N.E.2d 299 (1988) (eighteen-month suspension and five years probation). Following the Board\u2019s recommendation, it is\nORDERED that Michael J. Hoare is suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for the period of two years. This suspension is ordered nunc pro tunc to September 11, 1996, the date respondent filed an affidavit in compliance with D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14(g). Further, the reciprocal discipline proceedings are dismissed.\nSo ordered.",
