        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nIn this case arising under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the Industrial Accident Board denied the employer\u2019s petition to terminate benefits and granted the claimant\u2019s petition for commutation of benefits. See 19 Del.C. \u00a7 2358. On appeal, the Superior Court ordered a remand for clarification of the Board\u2019s ruling as to termination.\nAfter remand, the Board denied the employer\u2019s motion to continue a scheduled hearing and reaffirmed its prior rulings. Thereafter, when the case was returned from remand, the Superior Court, on request by the employer, deferred a ruling on the termination issue and reviewed only the Board\u2019s commutation of the award. The Court approved the Board\u2019s order of commutation, 389 A.2d 269 (1978), and, on appeal, this Court affirmed. 399 A.2d 534 (February 16, 1979). The Superior Court later affirmed the Board\u2019s ruling denying the employer\u2019s petition to terminate benefits.\nThe employer has appealed from the Superior Court\u2019s most recent order, contending that the Board abused its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance of the hearing, and that the Board erred in determining that the claimant was a \u201cdisplaced\u201d person.\nThe claimant has moved, pursuant to Rule 25(a), to affirm the judgment of the Superior Court on the ground that it is manifest on the face of the employer\u2019s brief that the appeal is without merit. We have concluded that the motion should be granted.\nAs to the first contention, the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for continuance of a hearing scheduled at the employer\u2019s request. See Board Rule 12(b) which requires timely notice of a request for a continuance. Here, the application was made on the date of the hearing.\nOn the issue of the claimant\u2019s status, there is evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that he is a displaced worker, cf. Hensley v. Arctic Roofing, Inc., Del.Supr., 369 A.2d 678 (1976); Ham v. Chrysler Corp., Del.Supr., 231 A.2d 258 (1967); and the employer failed to meet its burden under Franklin Fabricators v. Irwin, Del.Supr., 306 A.2d 734 (1973), of showing that work within his capability is available.\n* * * * * *\nAffirmed.",
