The issue, as stated by the Commonwealth, is:\nWhether the Pennsylvania Superior Court erred by determining that Respondent\u2019s conviction for Arson in the Third Degree, as defined in N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 150.10, was not an equivalent offense to Arson as defined in the Pennsylvania Crimes Code at 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3301(a), and thus, not a crime of violence as defined by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9714(g)?",
