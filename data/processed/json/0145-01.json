        "text": "KING, Senior Judge:\nYetta Drayton was charged with attempted possession of a prohibited weapon, simple assault and attempted threats arising from a September 23, 1999 altercation between Drayton and her thirteen-year-old son D.D. After a two-day bench trial, Drayton was found guilty of attempted possession of a prohibited weapon and simple assault, but was found not guilty of attempted threats. Drayton\u2019s conviction was based almost exclusively on the testimony of two police officers as to the out-of-court statements of D.D. and an unidentified witness. Drayton filed a timely appeal. After briefs were submitted, the Supreme Court decided Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing Crawford\u2019s impact on the admissibility of the hearsay testimony at Drayton\u2019s trial.\nFor the reasons set forth below, we hold that the admission of the officers\u2019 testimony regarding D.D.\u2019s out-of-court statements violated Drayton\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights as defined by Crawford, supra, and that their admission was prejudicial error. We, therefore, reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.\nI.\nOn September 23, 1999, at 3:22 p.m., Metropolitan Police Department Officer Robert McCollum responded to a radio call reporting an assault in progress outside 1227 M Street, N.E. When he arrived at the scene approximately three minutes later, Officer McCollum saw Drayton, who matched the dispatcher\u2019s reported description of a \u201cblack female, red and black hair, black jeans, woman with a knife.\u201d Officer McCollum told Drayton to drop the knife and approach him, and she complied. McCollum testified that Drayton was \u201cirate,\u201d \u201cflapping her arms, talking real loud profanely,\u201d and that he smelled alcohol on her breath. At that point, Officer McCollum placed her in handcuffs and put her in his patrol car. After conversing with Drayton regarding what had occurred, Officer McCollum crossed the street to speak with some of the bystanders.\nOfficer Albert Williams responded to the same radio call and arrived on the scene as Officer McCollum was confronting Dray-ton. Officer Williams described Drayton as \u201cbelligerent\u201d and \u201c[i]ntoxicated, very irate, cussing, upset, going off.\u201d Officer McCollum testified that Officer Williams arrived around the time that Officer McCollum was placing Drayton in the patrol car, and Officer Williams stated, \u201c[W]e were trying to find out what was going on. It was kind of chaotic at the time.... Basically, I talked to witnesses to find out what was going on.\u201d Several unidentified witnesses then called to Officer Williams, yelling, \u201cThere she is. You need to get her,\u201d and \u201cShe had a knife. She\u2019s the one right there.\u201d Officer Williams was allowed to testify, over defense\u2019s objection, that he then spoke with an unidentified female witness, and that the witness told him that Drayton \u201cpulled a knife on her little boy, you need to get her.\u201d The witness was never identified nor called to testify, and the officer\u2019s testimony was admitted under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the hearsay rule.\nApproximately five to ten minutes after Officer Williams spoke with the unidentified female witness and fifteen to twenty minutes after Officer McCollum arrived on the scene, complaining witness D.D., Dray-ton\u2019s son, returned and spoke with the officers. D.D. was \u201ccrying, very upset, very emotional, in a daze, stuttering.\u201d Officer McCollum testified that D.D. told him that D.D. and his mother \u201chad got into an argument over some money he was supposed to have gave to her. Apparently he didn\u2019t give it to her and they got into an argument and she punched him in the face, and somehow they got into a scuffle. At that time, she produced a knife and stated \u2018I\u2019m going to stab you motherfucker if you don\u2019t give me my motherfucking money.\u2019 \u201d Officer McCollum testified that D.D. stated that \u201chis mother had pulled a knife on him, and wanted him to give her some money, and thought that he had had some money of hers.\u201d Both statements were admitted, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, as excited utterances.\nD.D. did not testify; however, he did complete a signed statement which defense counsel introduced into evidence through the testimony of Robert Ames, an attorney for the Public Defender Service. The statement was witnessed by Ames while Drayton sat just outside the room where the statement was given. Ames testified that D.D. wrote in the statement that he had lied to the police on the day in question because he was angry with his mother for refusing to take him shopping for clothing. According to D.D.\u2019s statement, Drayton never pulled out a knife or threatened D.D. with a knife.\nDrayton testified that D.D. was angry with her because she would not take him shopping for clothes. She explained that she had a few drinks with her lunch, and that she had eaten an apple, which was why she was carrying a knife at the time of the incident. According to Drayton, she and D.D. had a minor physical altercation, during which she removed the knife from her pocket after it cut her through her jeans, throwing the knife to the ground. She denied ever brandishing the knife, or threatening her son with it. The trial court found Officers McCollum and Williams to be credible, basing its verdict entirely on their testimony regarding D.D.\u2019s out-of-court statements. The trial court specifically discredited Drayton\u2019s testimony and D.D.\u2019s written statement, noting that Drayton was in the next room when the statement was taken, and that the statement \u201ctracks the testimony\u201d of Drayton. The trial court subsequently found Drayton guilty of simple assault and attempted possession of a prohibited weapon, sentencing her to 120 days\u2019 incarceration on each count, to be served concurrently, and two years\u2019 probation. This appeal followed.\nII.\nWe must first consider what standard of review governs in these circumstances. Constitutional claims preserved on appeal -by objection below are subject to review under the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard articulated in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Arguments raised for the first time on appeal, however, are reviewed for plain error. Harris v. United States, 602 A.2d 154, 159 (D.C.1992) (en banc). To survive a \u201cplain error\u201d review, appellants must show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). Where the three conditions are met, the court \u201cmay then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. Additionally, \u201cwhere the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal,\u201d as is the case in the instant appeal, \u201cit is enough that an error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d Id. at 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544.\nDrayton claims that defense counsel\u2019s objections below were sufficient to preserve her Confrontation Clause claim for \u201charmless error\u201d review. The government argues that Drayton\u2019s objections were insufficient to preserve her claim, and thus'her claim must be-reviewed for plain error. However, the government concedes, if we conclude that the statements at issue are \u201ctestimonial\u201d under Crawford, that their admission without the opportunity for cross-examination would constitute prejudicial error as \u201cthe trial court based its verdict entirely on the officers\u2019 testimony concerning D.D.\u2019s out-of-court statements.\u201d Such an error clearly would not only affect substantial rights but would seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. Because we conclude that the statements were \u201ctestimonial\u201d and because Drayton can therefore satisfy the more stringent of the two standards of review, we need not choose which would ordinarily apply in the circumstances presented here.\nIII.\nUntil the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Crawford, supra, the admissibility of out-of-court statements was governed by Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), in which the Court held that such statements were constitutionally admissible where they fell within a firmly-rooted hearsay exception or bore \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Id. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. In Crawford, the Court rejected the Roberts test, Crawford, 541 U.S. at 61-68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, and held that, under the Confrontation Clause, the only constitutionally permissible indicia of the reliability of prior testimonial statements is the defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. See id. at 61, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Court elected to \u201cleave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d but stated that the term \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations,\u201d as these particular practices are the closest modern equivalent to the abuses targeted by the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354.\nThe issue presented here is controlled by our decision in Stancil v. United States, 866 A.2d 799 (D.C.2005), a domestic violence appeal challenging the testimony of the responding officer. In Standi, we addressed for the first time the effects of Crawford on the admission of a police officer\u2019s recitation of certain out-of-court statements by the victim and the victim\u2019s daughter, where neither declarant testified, which were admitted as \u201cexcited utterances.\u201d Id. at 801-02, 807.\nThe Standi court first noted an emerging legal theory that excited utterances\u2014 since they are by definition made while still under the stress of the exciting event \u2014 cannot be made in contemplation of prosecution, and therefore are never testimonial. Id. at 808; see, e.g., Hammon v. State, 809 N.E.2d 945, 952-53 (Ind.Ct.App.2004); Fowler v. State, 809 N.E.2d 960, 964 (Ind.Ct.App.2004) (quoting Hammon). The court, however, rejected that view, persuaded instead by the reasoning articulated in Lopez v. State, 888 So.2d 693 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004):\nA statement made in the excitement of a startling event is likely to be more reliable given the fact that the declarant had little time to make up a story. But, under Crawford, reliability has no bearing on the question of whether a statement was testimonial. Some testimonial statements are reliable and others are not.... [A] startled person who identifies a suspect in a statement made to a police officer at the scene of a crime surely knows that the statement is a form of accusation that will be used against the suspect. In this situation, the statement does not lose its character as a testimonial statement merely because the declarant was excited at the time it was made.\nId. at 699-700. We then held that \u201c[s]ome excited utterances are testimonial, and others are not, depending upon the circumstances in which the particular statement was made.... [W]e conclude that such utterances cannot automatically be exempted from the strictures of Crawford.\u201d Stancil, 866 A.2d at 809.\nStandi also addressed the definition of \u201cpolice interrogation\u201d under Crawford, specifically as it applies to \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements. Noting that the term \u201cpolice interrogation\u201d is used throughout the Crawford opinion without indicating that it requires anything more than \u201cquestioning in a structured environment,\u201d we held that \u201c[n]either additional \u2018formality\u2019 nor an \u2018adversarial setting,\u2019 however slight, is required\u201d to define \u201cpolice interrogation.\u201d Id. at 811-12. However, the court did note that the types of police interrogations cited in Crawford \u201cinvolve[d] a declarant\u2019s knowing responses to structured questioning in an investigative environment or a courtroom setting where the declarant would reasonably expect that his or her responses might be used in future judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. at 812 (quoting United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 228 (2d Cir.2004)).\nFollowing the analysis in Kilday, supra note 6, Standi distinguished between two stages of police questioning: questioning conducted while \u201csecuring the scene\u201d during the initial stage of the encounter, and questioning conducted after the officers\u2019 attentions have turned to \u201cinvestigation and fact-gathering.\u201d Id. at 812-13. Before the area has been secured, where, for example, there is no indication that the officers are \u201caware of the nature of the crime at issue or the identity of the alleged assailant,\u201d the officers are unaware of the location of the assailant or the threats posed to the officers or the community, and the necessity of immediate medical attention is undetermined, the officers are not \u201cacting in an investigative capacity to produce evidence in anticipation of a potential criminal prosecution.\u201d Id. (citing Kilday, supra note 6, 20 Cal.Rptr.3d at 172-74). Thus, the elicited statements are not testimonial. However,\n[OJnce the scene has been secured, and once the officers\u2019 attention has turned to investigation and fact-gathering, statements made by those on the scene, in response to police questioning, tend in greater measure to take on a testimonial character, and they are thus ordinarily inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause in the absence of a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\nId. at 813. We will now apply these principles to the facts presented here.\nThis case involves testimony recounting out-of-court statements from two different people: one from the unidentified witness, who told Officer Williams that Drayton \u201cpulled a knife on her little boy, you need to get her,\u201d the other from D.D., who told Officers McCollum and Williams that he had argued with Drayton, and that Dray-ton had pulled a knife on him and threatened to stab him. It is not clear from the record whether the officers were securing the scene or investigating and fact-gathering when Officer Williams spoke with the unidentified witness; however, for the reasons stated below, we need not decide that point.\nWe are satisfied that the officers spoke to D.D. after the scene was secured. At that point, fifteen to twenty minutes after Officer McCollum arrived on the scene, the knife had been recovered, Drayton was handcuffed and inside the patrol car, Officer McCollum had conversed with Drayton \u201cas to what exactly was going on,\u201d and Officer Williams had been told by several witnesses that Drayton had assaulted her son with a knife. Officer McCollum testified that he spoke to D.D. to get \u201chis account of the story.\u201d At that point, the officers were well aware of the nature of the crime at issue and of the identities of the participants. It does not appear that there was any ongoing danger to the officers or to the community, nor is there any indication that they were evaluating the scene to determine if anyone needed immediate medical attention. See Stancil, supra, 866 A.2d at 812; Kilday, supra note 6, 20 Cal.Rptr.3d at 172. We, therefore, conclude that the officers, at this point, were investigating a crime and fact-gathering in anticipation of potential future prosecution. Therefore, D.D.\u2019s statements were \u201ctestimonial\u201d under Crawford, and, since D.D. was not available for cross-examination, their admission was plainly erroneous. Johnson, supra, 520 U.S. at 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544. Finally, because the government has conceded that the admission, if erroneous, was prejudicial \u2014 given that the trial court based its verdict entirely on D.D.\u2019s statements \u2014 there is no need for us to undertake a prejudice analysis.\nAccordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial.\nSo ordered.\n. In, violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-3214(b), - 504, and-507 (1981).\n. The statements of the bystanders, who Officer McCollum testified were \"upset\u201d and \"concerned about the child,\u201d are not at issue in this appeal.\n. These statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to place the officer\u2019s actions into context.\n. Defense counsel at trial objected to Officer McCollum's testimony regarding D.D.'s out-of-court statements by claiming that the government failed to \"[lay] enough foundation for an excited utterance.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objections to Officer Williams' testimony regarding the statements of D.D.- and the unidentified witness were similarly based on a failure to lay a foundation establishing that the statements qualified as excited utterances.\n. Government\u2019s Br. at 33 n. 29\n. See abo People v. Kilday, 20 Cal.Rptr.3d 161, 173-74 (Cal.Ct.App. 1st Dist.2004) (declining to adopt \"a blanket rule that all statements obtained from victims or witnesses by police officers responding to emergency calls are necessarily nontestimonial\u201d and rejecting the definitions of testimonial statements in Hammon and Fowler as more restrictive than contemplated by the Crawford Court), review granted, depublished, 23 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 105 P.3d 114(2005).",
