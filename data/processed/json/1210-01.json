        "text": "PELLEGRINI, Judge.\nWilliam Pizor (Claimant) appeals an order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirming the Referee\u2019s decision modifying Claimant\u2019s weekly benefits because he refused suitable alternative employment.\nOn July 30,1987, while working for Frank-ford Quaker Grocery Company (Employer) as a truck driver, Claimant injured his back while loading a truck. A notice of compensation payable was filed, and Claimant received benefits until they were terminated by agreement. However, when Claimant\u2019s disability recurred, by a notice of compensation payable, Claimant again began receiving benefits for his original July 30, 1987 injury.\nAfter having Claimant examined by its doctor, Employer filed a petition for termination of Claimant\u2019s compensation benefits, contending that Claimant had recovered from his work injuries. Additionally, if termination was not granted, Employer sought a modification of the benefits because Claimant refused suitable employment. Accepting Claimant\u2019s medical testimony over that of Employer, the Referee refused to terminate benefits. However, the Referee did agree with Employer that Claimant had refused alternative employment and modified his weekly wage. Claimant appealed to the Board which affirmed. This appeal followed.\nThe Referee\u2019s modification of Claimant\u2019s benefits was based upon the testimony of Agnes Gallen, a certified rehabilitation counselor with expertise in vocational placement. Ms. Gallen testified that, at the Employer\u2019s request, she performed a vocational evaluation of Claimant on November 29, 1989. After interviewing Claimant regarding his vocational background and interests, his educational background, his perception of his physical abilities, and his daily activities, and after reviewing Claimant\u2019s medical records, she provided Claimant with a list of jobs that were available and which he could perform.\nOver the objections of Claimant\u2019s counsel, Ms. Gallen further testified that she had subsequently contacted the employers of these positions to determine whether Claimant had received any of the jobs. Ms. Gallen testified that five of the employers told her that Claimant had not applied for the positions, while four of the employers stated that Claimant did apply for positions with them. Ms. Gallen also testified that she was told by Bayard Sales Corporation (Bayard) that Claimant had applied for a position there which was offered at a wage between $6.50 and $7.50 per hour plus benefits, but that he was not considered for the job because he had demanded a wage of $10.00. Ms. Gallen further testified that Bayard had told her that the position was still available to Claimant if he would consider the offered wages.\nContradicting Ms. Gallen\u2019s testimony, Claimant testified that he had applied for the jobs on the list provided by Ms. Gallen, and that he either did not get the job because of his physical limitations, was not contacted by the prospective employer, or was told that the companies were not hiring. Claimant also stated that, although he had applied for the job with Bayard, he never received a job offer.\nWhile accepting as credible Claimant\u2019s testimony that he had applied for all of the jobs on the referral list, the Referee, relying on Ms. Gallen\u2019s testimony of what she was told by Bayard concerning Claimant\u2019s demand for a higher wage, found that Claimant had acted in bad faith with respect to this position. Because Claimant acted in bad faith, the Referee modified Claimant\u2019s benefits. Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Constr. Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987).\nClaimant contends that, because the Referee\u2019s modification of benefits is based solely on impermissible hearsay, i.e., Ms. Gallen\u2019s testimony as to what she was told by Bayard regarding Claimant\u2019s insistence on a particular wage, there is insufficient evidence to support the Referee\u2019s decision of bad faith on Claimant\u2019s part. Hearsay evidence on the part of vocational experts has been permitted, as with all experts, when it is based upon the personal observations of the witness, or it is of \u201cthe type reasonably relied on by an expert in the particular field in forming an opinion on the subject.\u201d Acme Markets, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Pilvalis), 142 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 400, 409 n. 3, 597 A.2d 294, 298 n. 3 (1991); see also Yezovich v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (USX Corp.), 144 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 601, 601 A.2d 1341 (1992).\nIn Acme Markets, this Court noted that the testimony of an employer\u2019s vocational witness relating to the duties associated with a job was admissible to the extent that the expert was testifying as to his own personal observations or to data reasonably relied upon by vocational experts. Acme Markets at 409 n. 3, 597 A.2d at 298 n. 3. Similarly, in Yezovich, this Court held that the testimony of an employer\u2019s vocational expert was admissible when it was based upon the expert\u2019s own observations in reference to the claimant\u2019s follow-up on job referrals, including his availability, his attitude, and the sincerity of his efforts. Yezovich at 606, 601 A.2d at 1343.\nApplying these principles to Ms. Gallen\u2019s conversations with Bayard, her testimony was not of the type that is permissible hearsay because it was not premised on the type of information normally relied upon by vocational experts in forming a professional opinion. Rather, her testimony concerned the truth or veracity particular event, i.e., whether Claimant told Bayard that he would not work except at a higher wage. Being impermissible hearsay, it should have been excluded.\nBecause Ms. Gallen\u2019s testimony was impermissible hearsay, there is no evidence to support the Referee\u2019s finding that Claimant acted in bad faith in applying for the job with Bayard. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Board.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 23rd day of November, 1994, the Order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board dated December 22, 1993, No. A92-2797, is reversed.\n. Our scope of review is limited to determining whether constitutional rights have been violated, errors of law have been committed, or necessary findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence. SEPTA v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Scott), 136 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 98, 582 A.2d 421 (1990); petition for allowance of appeal denied, 527 Pa. 658, 593 A.2d 428 (1991).\n. Walker v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 27 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 522, 527, 367 A.2d 366, 370 (1970) (holding that \"hearsay evidence, properly objected to, is not competent evidence to support a finding of the Board\").\n. Claimant also contends that Employer did not make good faith job referrals because he neither informed the prospective employers of Claimant's limitations nor established that they were willing to employ Claimant despite those limitations. In this regard, an employer need only adduce medical evidence of the claimant\u2019s physical condition and prove that the job referrals comport with the claimant\u2019s physical limitations. Kachinski v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Constr. Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987). Here, Employer did produce such evidence, and in fact. Claimant\u2019s medical witness testified that he could perform the duties associated with the position at Bayard.",
