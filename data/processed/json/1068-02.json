Waring. On appeal GPPDC challenges the denial of its motion to set aside entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(c) of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. Because the record does not demonstrate either a good excuse for the failure to answer prior to entry of default or a meritorious defense to the action, we affirm the judgment. See Michaud v. Mutual Fire, Marine & Inland Ins. Co., 505 A.2d 786, 790-91 (Me.1986).\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.",
