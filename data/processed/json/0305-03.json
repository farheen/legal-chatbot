After hearing arguments of counsel and considering defendant\u2019s brief, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was correct in refusing to accept that portion of the arbitration record which consisted only of exhibits, the parties having stipulated before the arbitrators that no transcription or recording of the arbitration proceedings be made. We are also of the opinion that the trial justice applied the correct rule of law in confirming the award. Westminster Const. Corp. v. PPG Industries, R.I., 376 A.2d 708 (1977). Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s motion to affirm the judgment below is hereby granted and defendant\u2019s appeal is denied and dismissed.",
