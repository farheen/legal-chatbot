Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 121 S.Ct. 2448, 150 L.Ed.2d 592 (2001). Upon consideration of the motion and the memoranda filed by counsel for the parties, we conclude that a remand is appropriate here.\nAccordingly, the motion is granted, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for reconsideration in light of Palaz- zolo, supra. If on remand the Superior Court determines that Woodland possesses standing to pursue the temporary-inverse-condemnation claim, the Superior Court shall proceed to decide the claim on the merits, as previously directed by this Court in Woodland Manor III Associates v. Keeney, 713 A.2d 806 (1998).",
