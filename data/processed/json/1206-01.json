        "text": "OPINION BY\nOLSZEWSKI, J.:\n\u00b6 1 Appellants (Alan Feldman, Jacqueline Feldman, and Joseph Entine, M.D.) appeal the order granting appellee (Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association) summary judgment. On appeal, appellants challenge the grant of summary judgment by claiming that appellee is obligated to pay a proportional share of delay damages and post-judgment interest in addition to the amount already paid under the insurance policy at issue. We affirm.\n\u00b6 2 On December 2, 1989, the Physicians Insurance Company issued an insurance policy to Joseph H. Entine, M.D. Physicians Insurance Company Physicians Professional Liability Policy, at 1. The policy provided coverage of $200,000 per occurrence, beginning January 1,1990, and ending January 1,1991. Id. at 4.\n\u00b6 8 On August 16, 1990, Alan Feldman underwent surgery, performed by Dr. En-tine, in order to remove a cancerous growth embedded in Mr. Feldman\u2019s thyroid gland. Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/99, at 1. During the operation, Mr. Feldman\u2019s laryngeal nerve was damaged, causing paralysis of the left vocal cord. Id. at 2. Because of the paralysis, Mr. Feldman\u2019s voice was permanently injured, resulting in constant hoarseness and weakness of voice. Id.\n\u00b6 4 In April of 1992, Alan and Jacqueline Feldman commenced an action against Dr. Entine alleging medical malpractice. Pa. R.A.P. 1925(a) Opinion, 5/26/04, at 1. Physicians Insurance Company provided Dr. Entine\u2019s defense. Id. On January 21, 1998, Physicians Insurance Company was declared insolvent by an order of liquidation issued by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. Id. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (hereinafter \u201cPIGA\u201d), through statutory mandate, assumed Dr. Entine\u2019s defense; PIGA was not a party in the underlying action. Id. at 2. After a mistrial in May of 1997, a second trial was held in May of 1999, in which the jury found Dr. Entine liable. Id. The jury verdict consisted of an award of $2,500,000.00. Trial Court Order, 9/9/99, at 1. Delay damages of $1,251,868.20 were additionally assessed, resulting in a total judgment of $3,751,863.20. Id. By December 28, 2000, PIGA had issued to the Feldmans checks totaling $200,000, the amount of the underlying insurance policy. Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) Opinion, 5/26/04, at 2.\n\u00b6 5 In March of 2001, appellants commenced a declaratory action in order to determine PIGA\u2019s responsibility for a proportionate share of the delay damages and post-judgment interest. Id. On March, 1, 2004, PIGA filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted on April 12, 2004. Id. This is the resulting appeal.\n\u00b6 6 Appellants frame the issue for our review as follows:\nWhether the lower court erred in denying the motion for summary judgment of appellants and in granting the motion for summary judgment of appellee, finding that appellee had no obligation to pay the insolvent insurers\u2019 proportionate share of delay damages and post-judgment interest, even though the insolvent insurer would have been required to pay such damages, and even though the [PIGA] statute does not absolve [PIGA] of the obligation to pay such damages?\nAppellants\u2019 Brief, at 1.\n\u00b6 7 Appellant challenges the lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for appellee. Our standard of review on an appeal from the grant of summary judgment is settled: a reviewing court may disturb the order of the trial court \u201conly where it is established that the court committed an error of law or abused its discretion.\u201d Capek v. Devito, 564 Pa. 267, 767 A.2d 1047, 1048 n. 1 (2001). In evaluating the trial court\u2019s decision to enter summary judgment, we focus on the legal standard articulated in the summary judgment rule, Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2. The rule states that \u201cwhere there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to relief as a matter of law, summary judgment may be entered.\u201d Young v. Penn-DOT, 560 Pa. 373, 744 A.2d 1276, 1277 (2000). We will view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party.\u201d Pennsylvania State University v. County of Centre, 532 Pa. 142, 615 A.2d 303, 304 (1992).\n\u00b6 8 According to the Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act, the purpose of the association is \u201cto provide a means for payment of covered claims under certain property and casualty insurance policies, to avoid excessive delay in the payment of such claims and to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders as a result of the insolvency of the insurer.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1801. A \u201ccovered claim\u201d is defined as \u201can unpaid claim ... which arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this article applies issued by an insurer if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after the effective date of this article.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1802. PIGA has the duty \u201cto pay covered claims,\u201d and \u201cany obligation of the association to defend an insured shall cease upon the association\u2019s payment or tender of an amount equal to the lesser of the association\u2019s covered claim obligation or the applicable policy limit.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1803(b)(l)(i). PIGA\u2019s obligation \u201cshall be satisfied by paying to the claimant ... an amount not exceeding three hundred thousand dollars per claimant.\u201d Id. And, \u201cin no event shall the association be obligated to pay a claimant in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy or coverage from which the claim arises.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1803(b)(1)(ii).\n\u00b6 9 There is no dispute that the claim asserted by the Feldmans against Dr. Entine is a covered claim. The dispute in this matter is in regard to the amount payable under the claim. Appellants argue that had the Physicians Insurance Company not become insolvent, it would have been obligated to pay the Feldmans the $200,000 policy limit and, additionally, a proportionate share of the delay damages and post-judgment interest. They note that the statute creating the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund (hereinafter \u201cCAT Fund\u201d) states that in addition to the CAT Fund\u2019s responsibility to pay delay damages and post-judgment interest, the basic insurance carrier is also responsible for its proportionate share., Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 7; 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.702\u00ae. Additionally, appellants note that Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 238 provides that \u201cat the request of a plaintiff in a civil action seeking monetary relief for bodily injury ... damages for delay shall be awarded to the amount of compensatory damages against each defendant found to be liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of the jury ... and shall become part of the verdict.\u201d\n\u00b6 10 While appellants\u2019 arguments are well articulated, we cannot agree. First, we note that the CAT Fund is not implicated, or otherwise interested, in the current declaratory action, and as such, the statutes pertaining to the CAT Fund are not applicable in the present matter.\n\u00b6 11 Appellants\u2019 other claim, that had the Physicians Insurance Company not become insolvent, it would have been obligated to pay the Feldmans the $200,000 policy limit as well as a proportionate share of the delay damages and post-judgment interest, is not necessarily true. This Court, interpreting Pa.R.C.P 238, has held that if delay damages \u201care found owing, the plaintiff may collect them from the defendant only. There is no provision for shifting liability to an insurer who has the sole right to conduct the defense.\u201d Hall v. Brown, 363 Pa.Super. 415, 526 A.2d 413, 416 (1987). The Court held that \u201cwhere the [insurer] has paid the limits of its policy, its liability may be enlarged provided [a showing] in a subsequent action that it breached its duty to act in good faith.\u201d Id. The Hall court went on to note: \u201cit is clear that a determination that an insurance carrier is liable for delay damages, even under [a] more discretionary and fault-based analysis, is something less than a finding that the carrier acted in bad faith.\u201d Id. Here, there have been no allegations of bad faith on the part of the insurance carrier in the assessment of delay damages; it therefore does not necessarily follow that had the Physicians Insurance Company not become insolvent, it would have had to pay delay damages in excess of the insurance policy limits.\n\u00b6 12 Additionally, the trial court stated in its opinion that Pa.R.C.P 238(a)(1) provides that delay damages are to be awarded \u201cagainst each defendant ... found liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of the jury.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 5/26/04, at 5. As the trial court noted, PIGA was not found hable to the plaintiff in the underlying action; hence, delay damages are inappropriate against PIGA. See Elliott-Reese v. Medical Prof'l Liab. Catastrophe Loss Fund, 805 A.2d 1253, 1255 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) (holding PIGA\u2019s obligation to a patient who prevailed in a medical malpractice action against her physicians was limited to the policy limit of the physicians\u2019 insolvent insurance earner, so that PIGA, which paid the policy limit, was not required to pay a share of delay damages and post-judgment interest; any recovery for delay damages was to be pursued through the Physicians Insurance Company liquidation proceedings).\n\u00b6 13 PIGA satisfied its obligation by paying the Feldmans the amount of the policy limit, and the trial judge did not commit an error of law or abuse her discretion in granting PIGA summary judgment.\n\u00b6 14 Order affirmed.\n\u00b6 15 Concurring Statement by P. J. DEL sole:\n. 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 991.1801-991.1820.\n. Because the trial court did not find PIGA liable for damages above the policy limit, attorneys' fees, costs and interest, also prayed for by appellants, were not awarded.",
