        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice.\nGerald Owen Newell Emery appeals from a judgment entered in the Superior Court (York County, Cole, J.) following a jury trial convicting him of three counts of gross sexual assault, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 253(1)(B) (Supp. 1994); two counts of unlawful sexual contact, id. \u00a7 255(1)(C) (Supp.1994); and one count of assault, id. \u00a7 207 (1983). The only issue Emery raises that merits discussion is whether the trial court admitted irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony of a medical expert. We affirm the judgment.\nEmery\u2019s victims, E. and A., were the State\u2019s chief witnesses. E. was eight years old at the time of the events that led to Emery\u2019s convictions; her sister A. was ten. E. testified that Emery forced her to perform oral sex on him on two separate occasions and that he performed oral sex on her once. She also testified that he penetrated her vagina with his finger. A testified that Emery fondled her crotch through her clothing and that he pulled up her shirt and looked at her breasts. A. did not testify that Emery penetrated her vagina and he was not charged with any such offense.\nAt the trial the State offered the testimony of Dr. Edward McAbee, the victims\u2019 family physician. McAbee had examined both girls in order to determine whether they displayed any physical evidence of sexual abuse. He testified that A. had a one-millimeter vaginal opening. This finding precluded any possibility of forced vaginal penetration, which was consistent with A.\u2019s account of the abuse to which she was subjected. McAbee then testified that E.\u2019s hymenal opening measured four millimeters. McAbee characterized this finding as consistent with the vaginal penetration to which E. testified. On cross-examination, McAbee acknowledged that the four-millimeter opening, though consistent with vaginal penetration, was nonetheless within the normal range for a child of E.\u2019s age. He testified that a positive diagnosis of vaginal penetration in an eight-year-old would require an opening of eight to nine millimeters.\nEmery contends first that McAbee\u2019s testimony about A.\u2019s vaginal opening was irrelevant because Emery was not charged with a crime involving vaginal penetration of the older girl. According to Emery, M.R.Evid. 401 required the trial court to exclude McAbee\u2019s testimony about A.\u2019s hymenal opening. We review the trial court\u2019s determination that evidence is relevant only for clear error. See State v. Robinson, 628 A.2d 664, 666 (Me.1993). \u201cEvidence which has any rational tendency to prove or disprove a factual issue in the case, whether such evidence be immediate and direct or indirect and circumstantial, is relevant and should be admissible....\u201d State v. Doughty, 399 A.2d 1319, 1322 (Me.1979). The trial court must measure relevance on a continuum, and only when the \u201cevidence becomes so remote that its probative impact upon \u2018the existence of any fact that is of consequence\u2019 is reduced to zero\u201d must the court exclude the evidence. State v. Kotsimpulos, 411 A.2d 79, 81 (Me.1980) (citations omitted). McAbee\u2019s physical findings corroborated the girls\u2019 testimony. As with any such corroborative evidence, his testimony tended to prove that the behavior the girls alleged had actually occurred. It is therefore relevant.\nEmery next contends that McAbee\u2019s testimony was unduly prejudicial because it provided a basis for an unwarranted comparison by the jury of A.\u2019s one-millimeter opening to the four-millimeter opening of the younger girl. According to Emery, M.R.Evid. 403 required the trial court to exclude McAbee\u2019s testimony about A.\u2019s hymenal opening. Relevant evidence that is not otherwise inadmissible will be admitted unless it is unfairly prejudicial. M.R.Evid. 403. The trial court has broad discretion to weigh prejudice against probative value. See State v. Ifill, 574 A.2d 889, 891 (Me.1990). On identical sets of facts, \u201cone judge may admit the proffered evidence, while another judge may exclude it; and yet it may well be that neither will have committed any reversible error.\u201d Id. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial only if it inflames the jury, State v. McDonough, 507 A.2d 573, 575 (Me.1986), or results in \u201can undue tendency to move the tribunal to decide on an improper basis, commonly, though not always, an emotional one.\u201d State v. Forbes, 445 A.2d 8, 12 (Me.1982) (citations omitted).\nEmery effectively cross-examined McAbee on the significance of his physical findings, ameliorating the potential for prejudice. Moreover, the State\u2019s case focused on the testimony of the two victims who provided substantial direct evidence of Emery\u2019s guilt. The State did not refer to McAbee\u2019s examination of A. in its closing argument. On this record, we conclude that McAbee\u2019s testimony was not likely to inflame the jury or otherwise cause the jury to decide the case on an improper basis. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony.\nThe entry is:\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concurring.\n. M.R.Evid. 401 provides:\n\"Relevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\n. M.R.Evid. 403 provides:\nAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by die danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.",
