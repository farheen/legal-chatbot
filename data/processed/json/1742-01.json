        "text": "Rich, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\nThis appeal is from the decision of the Patent Office Board of Appeals affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection of the two claims remaining in application serial No. 67,411, filed November 4, 1960, for \u201cMethod of Converting a Bank Check.\u201d\nThe ground of rejection sustained was that the claimed invention is unpatentable over\nPfleiderer, 1,112,654, Oct. 6, 1914.\nIn affirming, the board considered the features in common presented by the appealed claims and the reference, considered the differences, and concluded:\nIt is our opinion that the above noted differences considered singly and collectively are not unobvious in view of the reference disclosure and the refusal to allow claims 9 and 10 is accordingly sustained * * *.\nClearly the statutory basis of this rejection is 35 USC 103. Appellant\u2019s brief says, \u201cThe rejection is based on \u2018obviousness\u2019 * *\nThe claimed \u201cmethod\u201d has to do with the conduct of banking business, more specifically the operation of checking accounts based on a line of credit or agreement on the part of the bank to loan money to the holder of the account. It operates as do permissive overdrafts with an agreement by the bank to permit installment repayment of advances made. The details are best seen in the appealed claims which read as follows:\n9. A method of producing and treating a promissory note, comprising the steps of recording a maximum credit limit between a bank and a customer for an account of said customer, preparing a stamp with a personalized notation thereon identifying said customer in the records of said bank and recording said notation on said records, writing a bank check in favor of a payee, affixing said stamp to said check and passing said check to said payee, presenting said check to said bank for payment and making said payment, and making a marking in said account in the amount of said check for debiting said amount to said customer on a periodic installment payment basis until said amount is paid by said customer.\n10. A method of converting a bank check into a promissory note, comprising the steps of making a deposit of money and writing a checking account between a bank and a bank customer to have the latter obtain bank credit and utilize a bank check for acquiring the credit upon writing the check, preparing means bearing identification indicia such that said means can be applied to said bank check and distributing said means to said customer, recording said indicia in the records of said bank under the name of said customer, writing a bank check in favor of a payee, affixing said identification indicia to said check at the selection of said customer when the latter desires to make a promissory note out of said check, passing said check to a payee for payment from said bank, and writing an entry in said account for debiting said account with periodic installment payments if said means is affixed to said check and for debiting said account with one full payment if no means is affixed to said check.\nPfleiderer discloses a scheme of certifying checks pursuant to which the holder of a regular checking account is issued stamps to the amount of his deposit, in various denominations, which he can affix to the check in amount sufficient to equal the amount for which it is drawn. Each stamp has his account number on it. The presence of the stamps on the check is supposed to indicate to the payee, assumed to understand the system, that there is money on deposit to cover the amount of the check and thus to act as a certification. While the purpose is different from appellant\u2019s, the reference discloses the mechanical feature of his claims, defined in claim 9 as \u201ca stamp with a personalized notation thereon identifying said customer in the records of said bank\u201d and also discloses the steps of \u201cwriting a bank check in favor of a payee, affixing said stamp to said check and passing said check to said payee, presenting said check to said bank for payment and making said payment * * In fact, except for the stamp, the last-mentioned steps are all conventional and so notoriously old and well-known that no reference is required to show them.\nIn arguing that the differences between his system and the disclosure of the reference would not be obvious, appellant begins by saying,\nAppellant\u2019s Claims 9 and 10 define a method of establishing and practicing an installment credit account with a bank and to have it in effect simultaneous [ly] with a conventional checking account, while both accounts utilize conventional checks, and the conventional checking system is utilized simultaneously. Thus, a customer may write a conventional bank check, and have it honored as either a conventional check or as a promissory note.\nThis is a revealing argument. First, it admits that the checking account is \u201cconventional\u201d and the checks are \u201cconventional.\u201d Second, it becomes quite clear that the customer really has two \u201caccounts\u201d with the bank, a regular checking account and a loan or installment credit account. Third, it is apparent that the bank must know\u2014as it always lias to know when a customer has a plurality of accounts\u2014which account is being drawn against. It knows this from the stamp or other \u201cindicia\u201d which the customer \u201caffixes\u201d to the check. We do not see in this anything unobviously different from writing the word \u201cspecial\u201d or putting some other account indication on a check. In any event, the specific device of an adhesive stamp bearing the account number is shown by the reference to be an old device. The board found nothing unobvious in appellant\u2019s calling his check with a stamp on it a \u201cpromissory note\u201d whereas the reference calls the same a \u201ccertified check\u201d and we are in accord. Finally, appellant refers to \u201chonoring\u201d a check with an indication affixed to it \u201cas a promissory note.\u201d The terminology here seems confused. Such a check is not honored by the bank as a promissory note. It is honored as a check in that the money is given to the payee, just as Pfleiderer\u2019s check is honored. It is thereafter treated by the bank as though it were a note drawn by the customer in favor of the bank and it is the customer who has to \u201chonor\u201d it as such. This is merely a matter of the contractual relations between the bank and its customer with whom it has agreed to advance money when, as, and if called for by checks drawn on the loan account. The checks remain checks. The customer must repay the advances. We see nothing unobvious, or novel, in this. We agree with the board that this is merely a matter of \u201cprivate arrangement between the bank and the customer\u201d and not an unobvious difference from the reference.\nAs to the concluding limitation of the appealed claims that the customer is debited for all money borrowed in a periodic installment payment account, the examiner said, \u201cIt is considered immaterial whether the bank chooses to collect in installments.\u201d We likewise consider that claimed feature to be immaterial to patentability, presumably for the same reason as the examiner, though he did not state his reason. Repayment of loans in installments, however, has become one of the commonest business practices in the United States long prior to appellant\u2019s 1960 filing date. We seem to recall that an excess of installment credit was considered to be one of the primary causes of the Great Depression which commenced in 1929. No reference need be cited by the Patent Office to show lack of novelty in such a notoriously old business arrangement as the repayment of loans in installments. Appellant\u2019s brief makes no assertion of novelty in the installment repayment feature, the board did not even consider it, and appellant\u2019s specification contains no mention of it (see fn. 1, supra). In support of the examiner\u2019s position, we deem ourselves justified in taking judicial notice of its antiquity, even without a reference, under the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Code of Evidence (1942) of which Rule 802 states, in part:\nThe judge may of his own motion take judicial notice of * * * (b) specific facts so notorious as not to be the subject of reasonable dispute * * *.\nThe examiner put the appellant on notice that installment repayment of money advanced against stamp-bearing checks was not a difference conducive to patentability and appellant has done nothing to meet that point.\nWe have reviewed the board\u2019s careful consideration of all of the asserted differences between the claimed invention and the disclosure of the reference and we fully agree with the Patent Office that in view of the disclosures of Pfleiderer the appealed claims define only subject matter which would have been obvious, at the time the invention was made, to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains, which is, in this case, the art of banking.\nThe decision of the board is affirmed.\nWoeley, C. J., concurs in the result.\nAppellant\u2019s claims call for installment payment of the loan and he argues about it but, oddly, his specifleation, as it appears in the record, never mentions this feature.\nWe note that we are not here concerned with whether systems of banking- are within the categories of patentable invention as enumerated in 35 USC 101. The examiner rejected the claims as not within that section but the board, on grounds not entirely clear to us, said, \u201cWe do not sustain the refusal to allow claims 9 and 10 on the ground of non-statutory basis * * That rejection is therefore not before us. This opinion should not be regarded as a precedent on that question.",

        "text": "Smith, Judge,\ndissenting, with whom AlmoND, J., joins.\nInitially, it should be made clear that what Wiechers is claiming here is, beyond question, a method of doing business. I agree with majority that the issue of patentable subject matter under 35 USC 101 is not before us. The only question is whether, on the present record, appellant\u2019s claimed method of doing business would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time appellant invented it,\n1 likewise agree with the majority regarding appellant\u2019s admission that checks and checking accounts are conventional. The Pfleiderer patent discloses these admittedly conventional concepts. The only other aspect of the Pfleiderer patent which has even the remotest bearing on the obviousness of appellant\u2019s claimed method of doing business is the concept of affixing stamps to a check for identification purposes.\nTo this disclosure, the majority adds several well known facts of business and banking life, and reaches the conclusion that appellant\u2019s claimed method of doing business would have been obvious. Thus the majority mentions \u201ca line of credit\u201d or an \u201cagreement on the part of the bank to loan money;\u201d \u201cpermissive overdrafts with an agreement by the bank to permit installment repayment;\u201d \u201ca periodic installment payment account\u201d and \u201crepayment of loans in installments.\u201d\nI am in complete agreement with the majority that the individual differences between appellant\u2019s claimed method and the certified check patented by Pfleiderer are all fairly conventional steps and, when considered individually and out of context, may be said to be \u201cobvious.\u201d But it is not obviousness of the differences which section 103 contemplates, but obviousness of the claimed subject matter as a whole. And appellant\u2019s claimed subject matter as a whole is a unique method of doing business which involves short-circuiting that marvel of modern-day society, the installment charge account, and its ubiquitous companion, the credit card. With appellant\u2019s scheme the consumer need not establish an account with each retailer he wishes to buy from; he need establish but one account, with the bank, and need make periodic installment payments to but one creditor, the bank.\nWhere, in the sum total of the prior art, including the conventional banking and business practices mentioned by the majority, is there even the slightest suggestion of such an ingenious scheme? I would not, of course, require a reference to meet every \u201cnut and bolt\u201d of the claim. But when, as in the instant case, the art is devoid of the barest suggestion of the very heart of a claimed idea, I feel the step from what the art does show to the holding of obviousness is overlong, and one not countenanced by section 103.\nThe majority states that \u201cRepayment of loans in installments * * * has become one of the commonest business practices in the United States long prior to appellant\u2019s 1960 filing date.\u201d I agree. And I would not limit it to the United States nor to any time short of remotest antiquity, for money lending is surely one of the world\u2019s oldest businesses. The same is true with the other conventional practices mentioned by the majority\u2014they are hoary with age. Note also the date of Pfleiderer\u2019s patent. In view of this, I ask the \u201cobvious\u201d question: If appellant\u2019s method of doing business is so clearly obvious, why does the record not show it ? I would reverse.",
