        "text": "KRAVITZ, Associate Judge:\nA Superior Court jury found appellant Kendrick H. Gaines guilty of two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. The verdict was based on evidence that appellant, a twenty-four-year-old black male, dropped a bag containing multiple packets of cocaine and marijuana as he fled on foot from police officers who had just stopped him in his car for driving while using a cellular telephone without a hands-free device in violation of District of Columbia law. On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court impermissibly curtailed his Sixth Amendment right to expose the officers\u2019 biases and prejudices through cross-examination concerning their pretextual reliance on minor traffic violations as grounds to stop and search suspects for drugs and, in particular, their selective enforcement of the hands-free law against black males. Appellant also contends that the trial court gave an unbalanced jury instruction on flight and erroneously allowed the government to elicit an opinion from its drug expert on the ultimate issue of his intent to distribute. We find no reversible error and accordingly affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.\nI.\nA.\nFour officers of the Metropolitan Police Department were working together in two marked scout cars on the night of February 18, 2007 \u201cchecking out drug activity\u201d in an area of Northeast Washington. At approximately 11:45 p.m., the officers \u2014 Glenn and Jordan in one car, and Hairston and Heraud in the other \u2014 drove in tandem eastbound through the 1200 block of Raum Street, N.E. toward an apartment building on the corner known to the officers for drug use and other drug-related crime. The officers traveled eastbound on the one-way westbound street hoping to catch drug dealers out in front of the building by surprise.\nAs the officers proceeded slowly down the narrow street, appellant passed within a few feet of them driving a car heading westbound in the same block. Appellant, too, was driving slowly, and the officers were able to see him by looking directly into his car through its driver\u2019s-side front window. Officer Heraud saw a portion of appellant\u2019s face, and Officers Heraud and Glenn both observed that appellant was using his left hand to hold a cellular telephone to his left ear in apparent violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 50-1731.04(a) (2004), which prohibits the use of a cellular telephone while driving except with a hands-free device. The officers discussed their observations over the police radio and decided to make a traffic stop. They turned their scout cars around, followed appellant through an alley, and tried to effect a stop in the 1200 block of Simms Place, N.E.\nAppellant promptly pulled over to the curb in response to the scout cars\u2019 lights and sirens. Before any of the officers could approach to investigate, however, appellant jumped out of his car and took off running. Officer Heraud chased appellant on foot down Simms Place and into an alley on the north side of the block. It was a bitterly cold night, with recently fallen snow and ice covering the ground, and the footing was treacherous for both appellant and Officer Heraud.\nOfficer Heraud testified that as appellant led him around a turn in the alley he observed appellant reach into his left front pants pocket and pull out a black plastic bag rolled up in a ball. Officer Heraud testified further that without breaking stride appellant dropped the bag to the snow- and ice-covered ground and continued running, with Officer Heraud in pursuit approximately ten feet behind. Appellant and Officer Heraud soon emerged from the alley onto Mount Olivet Road, N.E., still separated by a few feet. Appellant, however, slipped and fell on some ice in front of a convenience store on Mount Olivet Road, and Officer Heraud apprehended him.\nOfficer Jordan joined Officer Heraud on Mount Olivet Road and maintained custody of appellant while Officer Heraud walked back into the alley to look for the black plastic bag. Officer Heraud testified that within a minute and a half he found the bag lying on top of the snow and ice in the same location in which he had seen appellant drop it during the chase. The officers recovered the bag and found inside of it seventeen zip-lock bags containing a white rock substance (later proven to be cocaine) and ten zip-lock bags containing a green weed substance (later proven to be marijuana). The officers arrested appellant for possession with intent to distribute, and in a search incident to the arrest they seized $307.62 in small bills from appellant\u2019s person. The officers subsequently issued appellant a traffic ticket for violating the hands-free law, although they did not recover a cellular telephone from appellant\u2019s person or seize or take photographs of a cellular telephone Officer Her-aud testified he observed inside appellant\u2019s car following the arrest.\nB.\nAppellant sought through argument and cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses to present a defense that the officers were out late at night in a high crime area looking for pretextual reasons to stop and search people for drugs. Appellant argued that the officers\u2019 ulterior motives in stopping him for the hands-free violation showed their bias against him and cast doubt on Officer Heraud\u2019s testimony that he dropped the bag of cocaine and marijuana during the foot chase through the alley.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel first articulated the defense theory in his opening statement. Counsel told the jury that this was \u201ca case about police harassment, about police manufacturing an excuse ... to stop somebody and harass [him] and search [him] for drugs.\u201d Counsel continued, adding a suggestion that the officers focused their attention on appellant because he is a black male: \u201cAnd they manufacture this not because they\u2019re interested in issuing a ticket for using a cell phone without a hands-free device; they do it because they want to stop somebody, a black male driving a car, so that they can search for drugs.\u201d \u201c[T]he evidence will show that ... the police are biased, they have a bias against [appellant], and they\u2019re biased against him because they\u2019re looking to just manufacture a drug case. And because the police are biased, because they are manufacturing this case, because [they are] harassing somebody, we expect that there will be questions as to the credibility of the police.\u201d\nOfficer Glenn was the government\u2019s first witness at trial. He told the jury on direct examination about his observations of appellant holding what appeared to be a cellular telephone to his ear while driving and about the officers\u2019 efforts to effect a traffic stop. In response to a question from the prosecutor, Officer Glenn explained that he and his partners \u201ccommonly initiate traffic stops over things like cell phones\u201d because violations of traffic laws lead to accidents if the police do not intervene.\nOn cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel tried to establish an alternative motivation for the traffic stops effected by the officers. Specifically, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Officer Glenn whether the officers were trained \u201cabout ways that [they] can stop cars and commence searches of those cars.\u201d Officer Glenn answered \u201cYes.\u201d Yet when appellant\u2019s counsel then sought to pose a follow-up question (\u201cAnd one of the things that you\u2019re taught about is how to make traffic stops so that you can go ahead -and search cars and ask for \u2014 \u201d), the government objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The court explained that in denying a pretrial motion to suppress, it had already determined that the officers observed appellant violating the hands-free law and that the stop of appellant therefore was lawful under the Fourth Amendment even if it was pretex-tual, i.e. even if it was motivated by investigative interests beyond the enforcement of the hands-free law. See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 811-13, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). The following discussion occurred at the bench:\nTHE COURT: You spent a lot of time in opening [statement,] and now you\u2019re going ... into basically challenging the legality of the stop, which I\u2019ve already ruled is legal, so you can\u2019t be arguing to the jury through argument or cross-examination that the stop is pretextual because I\u2019ve ruled the stop is legal. You can argue that the officers aren\u2019t telling the truth about what they saw, but you can\u2019t go into pretext stops because the jury\u2019s not going to be deciding the legality [of] the stop.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: We would submit that it\u2019s proper for the jury to assess the motives of the police and the bias of the police in terms of why they made the stop to begin with.\nTHE COURT: But the stop, the stop is not in question. And you can argue that he\u2019s not credible, the officers aren\u2019t credible that the defendant [had] drugs or [was] fleeing or anything else ... but I think basically what you\u2019re trying to say is, which you certainly implied in opening, was this is an improper stop and, therefore, [the jury] should find him not guilty, and you can\u2019t argue that.\nNotwithstanding the trial court\u2019s ruling at the bench, however, the court then allowed appellant, over the government\u2019s objection, to ask Officer Glenn several additional questions relating to the officers\u2019 motives in stopping appellant for the hands-free violation:\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Now, officer, when you stop somebody for a traffic stop, is it \u2014 in this particular case was it your intention just to give a ticket for the traffic stop?\nOFFICER GLENN: Yeah.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: You didn\u2019t have any other motives in stopping someone for a traffic stop at this time?\nPROSECUTOR: Objection.\nTHE COURT: Overruled to some latitude.\nOFFICER GLENN: Every traffic stop can lead somewhere else.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: And when you conduct a traffic stop at 11:45 in the evening, you\u2019re looking for it to lead to something else, aren\u2019t you?\nOFFICER GLENN: Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. We made multiple stops every night.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: But my question is what you\u2019re looking for. OFFICER GLENN: We look for the violation that we stop them for, and if something else comes out of it then it does.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel voluntarily moved on at this point to another subject of cross-examination. He never sought to ask Officer Glenn any further questions aimed at exposing the officers\u2019 pretextual motives in stopping appellant, and he never raised with Officer Glenn the issue of selective enforcement of the hands-free (or any other traffic) law on the basis of race.\nOfficer Heraud testified next for the government. On direct examination, he recounted his observations of appellant holding a cellular telephone while driving and told the jury about the officers\u2019 efforts to effect a traffic stop. He then described the chase and, in particular, the motion by which appellant dropped the black plastic bag of drugs to the snow- and ice-covered ground in the alley.\nOn cross-examination, Officer Heraud testified that he observes between one and fifteen drivers violating the hands-free law in the course of a typical eight-hour shift. He stated, however, that he does not conduct a traffic stop every time he witnesses a hands-free violation. Asked why not, Officer Heraud explained that he \u201cmay be responding to a radio assignment ... [or] have another purpose for [his destination], whether it be the Fifth District, whether it be a radio assignment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel tried to probe further and to explore other possible motivations for Officer Her-aud\u2019s decisions to stop some but not all of the drivers he observes violating the hands-free law. The government objected, however, and the trial court ruled once again that the defense could not cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses (or argue to the jury) about the officers\u2019 reasons for stopping motorists for hands-free violations:\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: But if \u2014 if you want to find a reason to pull that car over \u2014 \u25a0\nPROSECUTOR: Objection.\nTHE COURT: All right, approach for a moment.\n(Bench conference)\nPROSECUTOR: Your Honor, this motion has been litigated.\nTHE COURT: Right, how does this not [go] directly to the basis for the stop? You seem to be saying you don\u2019t pull everybody over, which doesn\u2019t make the stop any less valid, and you seem to be trying to argue it\u2019s a pretext stop, right?\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: No, Your Honor, I\u2019m just asking questions to determine the facts, and the facts, even though the court has found the facts, the jury\u2019s entitled to make their own determination as to what the facts were. I\u2019m not arguing that it\u2019s an illegal\u2014\nTHE COURT: But then why are you asking him if he does or doesn\u2019t pull everybody over who\u2019s using cell phones?\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, it goes to his credibility.\nTHE COURT: How?\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Because our position is that \u2014 that there was no cell phone.\nTHE COURT: Obviously you can \u2014 I want to make it clear you can obviously cross-examine on credibility and the credibility is obviously an issue in every case, but when you start asking about pulling other people over for using cell phones you seem to be implying that he was improperly pulling this defendant over, and I\u2019ve already ruled it was proper. And you can go to questions about credibility, but motive for the stop, the pretext for the stop, and \u2014 and\u2014and the legality of the stop have all been ruled on.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: I\u2019m making the argument that the facts, the facts as stated by this officer that he saw the cell phone, that I\u2019m challenging the credibility of the officer on that fact, and the other questions are designed not to challenge the legality of the stop but to challenge the credibility of the officer that that was the reason.\nTHE COURT: But it doesn\u2019t matter what the reason for the stop was, and you are trying to argue that it was pretext and \u2014 and harassment and discrimination, mentioning, for example in the opening about black males, which again has nothing to do with this case\u2014 and attempting to, I think, invoke the jury\u2019s sympathies or prejudices improperly, and \u2014 and again I think your opening was [a] very aggressive opening that \u2014 that to me crossed the line in several places about what you\u2019re permitted to argue. And you can argue that he never saw a cell phone and a cell phone was [not] recovered and therefore you should disbelieve him about the drugs. That\u2019s [a] credibility argument. But to start discussing whether he pulls everybody over or not, that only \u2014 that purely goes to the basis for the stop; you can\u2019t do that.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: It would be our position that that also goes to bias.\nTHE COURT: I disagree.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel shifted to other subjects of cross-examination of Officer Heraud immediately following this bench conference. In his closing argument, however, counsel returned to appellant\u2019s defense theory that the officers used the hands-free violation as a pretextual basis for stopping appellant and searching him for drugs: \u201cSo we would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the testimony of the police is not to be believed, that it\u2019s all manufactured, that the police are biased in this case against [appellant], that they\u2019re in this area, they\u2019re just looking for drugs, and they\u2019re looking for anybody that they can stop to try to show that they have drugs on them. And that they\u2019re manufacturing these cases, this case in particular.\u201d\nII.\nAppellant claims that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to conduct bias cross-examination of the officers concerning their alleged pretextual motives in stopping him and what he contends was their selective enforcement of the hands-free law against black males. We are not persuaded.\nA.\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees every criminal defendant the right to confront the witnesses against him through cross-examination. Cross-examination \u201cis the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested,\u201d Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 808, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), and the opportunity for meaningful cross-examination therefore \u201cis critical for ensuring the integrity of the factfinding process,\u201d Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 736, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 96 L.Ed.2d 631 (1987).\nIn particular, \u201cthe exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u201d Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105. Questions aimed at uncovering the \u201c \u2018possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness\u2019 \u201d thus are \u201c[c]entral to\u201d and \u201c \u2018always a proper subject of cross-examination.\u2019\u201d Jenkins v. United States, 617 A.2d 529, 531 (D.C.1992) (quoting Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105; Springer v. United States, 388 A.2d 846, 855 (D.C.1978)). \u201c[A] criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \u2018to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors ... could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u2019 \u201d Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (quoting Davis, 415 U.S. at 318, 94 S.Ct. 1105).\nTrial judges nevertheless retain wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on bias cross-examination so as to prevent \u201charassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, or repetitive, cumulative, or only marginally relevant questioning.\u201d Scull v. United States, 564 A.2d 1161, 1164 (D.C.1989); see also Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431. \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985). Indeed, we have observed that \u201c[t]he inflammatory nature of racial bias is such that it requires careful shepherding in its presentation to the jury\u201d and that \u201c[t]rial court limitation of racial bias cross-examination may therefore be appropriate.\u201d Moreno v. United States, 482 A.2d 1233, 1238 (D.C.1984).\nMoreover, a defendant (or any other party) who seeks to cross-examine a witness to establish bias must lay a proper foundation, \u201cincluding a proffer of facts sufficient to enable the [trial] court \u2018to evaluate whether the proposed question is [in fact] probative of bias.\u2019 \u201d Howard v. United States, 978 A.2d 1202, 1207 (D.C.2009) (quoting Jones v. United States, 516 A.2d 513, 517 (D.C.1986)). \u201cThis requirement serves to prevent harassment of the witness, prejudice to the opposing party, confusion of the issues, and unnecessary waste of time; it [also] enables the [trial] judge to \u2018guard against the danger that counsel will ask highly prejudicial questions of witnesses with the almost certain knowledge that the insinuations are false.\u2019 \u201d McCraney v. United States, 983 A.2d 1041, 1052 (D.C.2009) (quoting Scull, 564 A.2d at 1164).\nThe requisite proffer must contain \u201cfacts supporting a \u2018genuine belief that the witness is biased\u201d in the manner asserted, or at least \u201ca \u2018well reasoned suspicion\u2019 rather than \u2018an improbable flight of fancy\u2019 to support the proposed cross-examination.\u201d McCraney, 983 A.2d at 1052 (quoting Brown v. United States, 683 A.2d 118, 124 (D.C.1996); Scull, 564 A.2d at 1164). This foundational requirement \u201cis meant to be \u2018fairly lenient,\u2019 \u201d id. (quoting Carter v. United States, 614 A.2d 913, 919 (D.C.1992)), and it must be applied flexibly, Clayborne v. United States, 751 A.2d 956, 963 (D.C.2000). \u201cEspecially in crimi nal cases, cross-examination is often genuinely exploratory rather than directly accusatory, for counsel often cannot know in advance what an opposing party\u2019s witness may have to say.\u201d Id. \u201cIt is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop.\u201d Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 692, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931); accord Best v. United States, 328 A.2d 378, 382 n. 3 (D.C.1974). However, the foundational requirement is not intended to be \u201ctrivial,\u201d and \u201c \u2018[t]he more pointed and directly accusatory the examiner\u2019s question, the stricter the foundational requirement becomes.\u2019 \u201d McCraney, 983 A.2d at 1052 (quoting Clayborne, 751 A.2d at 963).\nB.\nDespite the trial court\u2019s statements at the bench that cross-examination on the issue of pretext would be precluded, the court permitted appellant to question Officer Glenn without limitation about the full range of the officers\u2019 motives in stopping appellant for the hands-free violation. The trial court also allowed appellant to ask enough questions of Officer Heraud to expose that officer\u2019s inconsistent enforcement of the hands-free law and to imply a pretextual purpose for the stop. Appellant thus had a meaningful opportunity on cross-examination to show that the officers\u2019 predominant interest was in making drug arrests and thereby to suggest to the jury that the officers\u2019 ulterior motives cast doubt on their credibility \u2014 and, in particular, on the accuracy and reliability of Officer Heraud\u2019s testimony that appellant dropped a bag to the ground as he turned a corner in the alley and that the bag of drugs the officer later found was the same bag appellant dropped during the chase.\nThe trial court\u2019s preclusion of additional cross-examination of Officer Heraud concerning the officers\u2019 alleged pretextual motives therefore is subject only to an abuse of discretion standard on appeal. See Stack v. United States, 519 A.2d 147, 151 (D.C.1986) (\u201cOnce a trial judge has allowed enough cross-examination on an appropriate issue to satisfy the Sixth Amendment, limitation on further cross-examination will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Particularly in light of appellant\u2019s strong assertions, in both opening statement and closing argument, that the officers used the hands-free violation as a \u201cmanufactured\u201d basis to stop him for the purpose of searching him for drugs, we are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s rulings did not prejudice appellant. We conclude, accordingly, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion even if it did act prematurely in foreclosing further questioning of Officer Heraud. See Johnson v. United States, 398 A.2d 354, 367 (D.C.1979).\nC.\nWe have recognized ever since our decision in Moreno v. United States, 482 A.2d 1238, 1237-38 (D.C.1984), that a witness\u2019 racial animus or prejudice is a proper subject of bias cross-examination as long as the questions posed are relevant to the witness\u2019 credibility, supported by a sufficient factual proffer, and carefully tailored so as to limit their potentially inflammatory effect on the jury. \u201cIt is hard to conceive of a more \u2018prototypical form of bias\u2019 than racial bias.\u201d Brinson v. Walker, 547 F.3d 387, 393 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431).\nThe selective enforcement of traffic laws on the basis of race is intentional discrimination and a clear manifestation of racial bias. \u201cStops based on race or ethnic appearance send the underlying message to all our citizens that those who are not white are judged by the color of their skin alone.\u201d United States v. Montero-Camargo, 208 F.3d 1122, 1135 (9th Cir.2000). See Whren, 517 U.S. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769 (selective enforcement of traffic laws on the basis of race violates the Equal Protection Clause); McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987) (\u201cpurposeful discrimination\u201d is an essential element of any Equal Protection claim).\nIt is nevertheless a close question whether the record here supported bias cross-examination of the officers concerning their alleged selective enforcement of the hands-free law on the basis of race. Appellant made no explicit factual proffer supporting a claim of racial bias, and the record established no more than that the officers were aware of appellant\u2019s race and stopped him even though Officer Heraud does not pull over every driver he observes violating the hands-free law.\nYet even if we assume for purposes of this discussion that appellant was entitled to ask some exploratory (and appropriately limited) questions on cross-examination aimed at determining whether the officers considered his race in deciding to stop him for the hands-free violation, appellant never posed such a question to any witness at trial, and in all of the discussions about pretext up at the bench his counsel never even suggested that he wished to do so. Although appellant stated repeatedly that he wanted to show the officers\u2019 bias, his only mention of race or racial bias was his counsel\u2019s reference in opening statement to the police \u201cwanting] to stop somebody, a black male driving a car, so that they can search for drugs.\u201d\nThat lone reference was insufficient to support a conclusion that the trial court precluded proper bias cross-examination aimed at establishing the officers\u2019 racial bias. It was not the trial court\u2019s duty to engage in speculation about the intended direction of appellant\u2019s bias cross-examination. To the contrary, once the government lodged its objection on the ground of relevance, appellant was obliged to give the trial court at least a basic outline of what he wished to ask the officers and to explain to the court how the officers\u2019 answers to his questions would establish the officers\u2019 bias. Appellant failed to meet this obligation, and we accordingly find no error. As the Ninth Circuit explained in Harris v. United States, 371 F.2d 365, 366 (9th Cir.1967) (quoting United States v. Easterday, 57 F.2d 165, 166 (2d Cir.1932) (L. Hand, J.)), \u201cwhen a question is objected to as irrelevant, counsel conducting the inquiry should advise the court of the question\u2019s purpose. If he fails to do so, and the question is not \u2018inevitably and patently material,\u2019 the objection may be sustained without error,\u201d\nIII.\nAppellant\u2019s other contentions warrant only brief discussion.\nA.\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred by giving a non-standard jury instruction on flight that focused too heavily on the relationship between flight and feelings of guilt and failed to indicate that a variety of factors fully consistent with innocence can motivate a person to flee from the police.\nThe trial court instructed the jury as follows:\nA person who flees or hides after a crime has been committed or after he has been accused of a crime may be motivated by a variety of factors. You may, for example, consider flight or concealment as a circumstance tending to show feelings of guilt, and you may consider feelings of guilt as tending to show actual guilt. On the other hand, flight or concealment does not create a presumption of guilt, nor does it necessarily reflect that the person has feelings of guilt. You may not, therefore, presume a defendant is guilty merely because he fled or concealed himself.\nIf you find evidence of flight or concealment, you should consider and weigh such evidence along with all the other evidence in the case and give it the weight you think it deserves.\nAppellant asked the trial court to instruct the jury that the factors motivating a person\u2019s flight or concealment may be \u201cfully consistent with innocence,\u201d as stated in the standard Red Book jury instruction in effect at the time of trial. The trial court declined appellant\u2019s request.\nAn instruction on flight must give the jury a full explanation of the variety of motives and feelings that might prompt a person to flee, Austin v. United States, 414 F.2d 1155, 1157-58 (D.C.Cir.1969). We thus have held that a flight instruction is \u201cincomplete\u201d if it fails to state that flight may be motivated by factors that are fully consistent with innocence. Woody v. United States, 369 A.2d 592, 594 (D.C.1977). The instruction given here did not satisfy these requirements, and it therefore was erroneous.\nThe error, however, was harmless. Appellant established on cross-examination of Officer Heraud that he was driving without a license at the time he was stopped, and he argued in closing that it was his lack of a driver\u2019s license, rather than his alleged possession of cocaine and marijuana, that caused him to run from the police. Given the strength of the government\u2019s evidence and the forcefulness with which appellant put his theory of innocent flight before the jury, we are \u201cable to \u2018say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 \u201d Hinton v. United States, 979 A.2d 663, 690-91 (D.C.2009) (en banc) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).\nB.\nAppellant also complains that the trial court permitted the government to elicit an opinion from its drug expert on the ultimate issue of his intent to distribute. Relying exclusively on federal court decisions applying Rule 704(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, appellant contends that an expert witness may not \u201cstate an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged.\u201d Appellant did not raise this issue in the trial court, however, and we have long held that the local law of evidence in this jurisdiction does not prohibit expert witnesses from stating opinions on ultimate facts or issues to be resolved by the jury. See, e.g., Wilkes v. United States, 631 A.2d 880, 883 n. 7 (D.C.1993); Lampkins v. United States, 401 A.2d 966, 970 (D.C.1979). Particularly in light of the absence of any substantial dispute at trial over appellant\u2019s intent to distribute, we are satisfied that the trial court did not commit plain error on this issue. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); Davis v. United States, 984 A.2d 1255, 1259 (D.C.2009).\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that appellant\u2019s convictions must be affirmed.\nSo ordered.\n. Appellant does not challenge on appeal the trial court's pretrial ruling denying his motion to suppress.\n. The trial court's pretrial determination that the officers' motives in stopping appellant for the hands-free violation were irrelevant to the lawfulness of the stop under the Fourth Amendment, although clearly correct under Whren, 517 U.S. at 811-13, 116 S.Ct. 1769, was not dispositive of the analytically distinct question, raised at trial, of the admissibility of bias cross-examination relating to those same motives.
