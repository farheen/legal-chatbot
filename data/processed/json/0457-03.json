Therefore, the Court has determined that before a petition for allowance of appeal can be filed with this Court, it must first be reviewed by the Superior Court. Such a transfer, however, disregards the clear mandate of 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9546(d), which provides that petitions for allowance of appeal should be filed from the trial court\u2019s order.\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.",
