        "text": "REID, Associate Judge:\nThis case concerns a lawsuit brought by the principal clarinetist of the National Symphony Orchestra (\u201cNSO\u201d), appellant Loren Kitt, against the company responsible for producing and promoting the 1993 Fourth of July concert at the U.S. Capitol. The concert was shown on national television. Mr. Kitt took offense at the company\u2019s use of an actor to portray a clarinetist during the production. He subsequently filed a complaint against Pathmakers, Inc., the concert\u2019s production company; Jerry Colbert, the principal owner and operator of Pathmakers; and Walter Miller, the principal director of the performance, alleging: 1) Invasion of Privacy \u2014 False Light; 2) Fraud; and 3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. See Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6). This court reversed that judgment in Kitt v. Pathmakers, Inc., 672 A.2d 76 (D.C.1996), concluding that the trial court had erred in its consideration of factual matters outside of the complaint. After remand and discovery, the trial court granted summary judgment for appellees, Pathmakers, Inc. and its principals. Capital Concerts, Inc. is Pathmak-ers\u2019 successor (hereinafter, we refer to Capital Concerts and its principals as \u201cCapital Concerts\u201d). On appeal, Mr. Kitt contends that the trial court erred in its decision because: 1) there are disputed issues of material fact; and 2) he established a prima facie case on all three counts. We affirm.\nFACTUAL SUMMARY\nCapital Concerts had an agreement with NSO to promote and produce its July 4, 1993 concert. The contract granted Capital Concerts numerous rights, including \u201cthe exclusive right to record, edit, package, distribute and broadcast [the ojrches-tra\u2019s performance,\u201d and the authority to use the names and likeness of its members. Mr. Kitt performs under a contract with NSO.\nAt a rehearsal for the concert, Capital Concerts offered Mr. Kitt the opportunity to appear in a thirty-five second camera shot (\u201ca beauty shot\u201d) of a clarinetist playing, apart from the rest of the orchestra, on the balustrade of the Capitol during the opening of George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d Mr. Kitt, through management, rejected the offer, as well as a proposal that an actor pretend to \u201cplay\u201d the clarinet for this camera shot. Despite assurances to the contrary and without NSO\u2019s knowledge, Capital Concerts filmed the shot with an actor during the concert. The actor, who was dressed in a top hat and a tuxedo, neither physically resembled Mr. Kitt nor played the clarinet visually in the way he did.\nIn its decision to grant Capital Concerts\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that Mr. Kitt failed to satisfy the fourth element of a prima facie invasion of privacy \u2014 false light claim because he could not demonstrate that \u201ca reasonable person viewing the beauty shot would .., find the scene offensive.\u201d The trial court determined that: (1) the actor looked like a normal person and was not engaged in obnoxious or offensive behavior; and (2) regardless of whether the actor was portraying an orchestra member or Mr. Kitt, which was unclear, a reasonable juror would not find that an ordinary viewer would be offended. With respect to the fraud count, the trial court stated that Mr. Kitt failed to show that \u201che relied on misrepresentations by the defendants to induce him into performing, because his contractual obligation with NSO required him to perform.\u201d Furthermore, the court stated that Mr. Kitt had not \u201cassert[ed] any provable damages[, because] the concert, his earnings, performances, and private teachings have increased.\u201d Finally, the trial court determined that Mr. Kitt\u2019s claims of \u201cirritation, embarrassment, sleeplessness, and angst\u201d arising from the alleged impersonation of him, were insufficient to qualify as intentional infliction of emotional distress in light of our strict interpretation of what constitutes outrageous conduct.\nANALYSIS\nStandard of Review\nWe review the grant or denial of a summary judgment motion de novo. See Walton v. District of Columbia, 670 A.2d 1346, 1353 (D.C.1996). Summary judgment is appropriate only if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Colbert v. Georgetown Univ., 641 A.2d 469, 472 (D.C.1994) (en banc). It is \u201c \u2018properly granted if (1) taking all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, (2) a reasonable juror, acting reasonably, could not find for the nonmoving party, (3) under the appropriate burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d Kendrick v. Fox Television, 659 A.2d 814, 818 (D.C.1995) (quoting Nader v. de Toledano, 408 A.2d 31, 42 (D.C.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1078, 100 S.Ct. 1028, 62 L.Ed.2d 761 (1980)). \u201cThe moving party has the burden of \u2018demonstrating the absence of material disputed issues and the right to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Galloway v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 632 A.2d 736, 738 (D.C.1993) (citation omitted)). \u201cOnce the movant has made such a prima facie showing, the nonmoving party has the burden of producing evidence that shows there is \u2018sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute ... to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties\u2019 differing versions of the truth at trial.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Nader, supra, 408 A.2d at 48 (citation omitted)). \u201cConclusory allegations by the nonmoving party are not sufficient for that purpose.\u201d Id. at 818-19 (citing Beard v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 587 A.2d 195, 198 (D.C.1991)).\nAfter Capital Concerts moved for summary judgment, Mr. Kitt filed a statement of disputed material facts. Despite his allegations, our review of the record on appeal reveals no disputed issue of material fact. \u201cWe thus turn to examine the only remaining issue \u2014 whether there exists a legal theory entitling [Mr. Kitt] to judgment.\u201d Wolf v. Regardie, 553 A.2d 1213, 1216 (D.C.1989) (citing Williams v. Gerstenfeld, 514 A.2d 1172, 1177 (D.C.1986); Nader, supra, 408 A.2d at 42).\nInvasion of Privacy \u2014 False Light Claim\n\u201cThis court has relied on the Restatement] (Second) [of Torts\u2019] formulation of the law applicable to \u2018invasion of privacy\u2019 in determining the appropriate contours of a cause of action for invasion of that right....\u201d Vassiliades v. Garfinckel\u2019s, 492 A.2d 580, 587 (D.C.1985) (citations omitted). An invasion of privacy \u2014 false light claim requires a showing of: 1) publicity 2) about a false statement, representation or imputation 3) understood to be of and concerning the plaintiff, and 4) which places the plaintiff in a false light that would be offensive to a reasonable person. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652E (1977). \u201cFailure to establish any one of these elements will defeat a plaintiffs cause of action.\u201d Wolf, supra, 553 A.2d at 1220.\nMr. Kitt argues that Capital Concerts invaded his privacy by casting him in a false light with a flawed impersonation \u201ccalculated to make it appear that [he] was engaging in buffoonery inconsistent with his status as the principal clarinetist of a distinguished symphony orchestra.\u201d Moreover, he contends that a jury, not the trial court, should have decided whether the telecast was \u201cflattering\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d The trial court concluded, and we agree, however, that Mr. Kitt cannot establish a prima facie false light claim because he cannot show that the portrayal by the actor was \u201cof and concerning the plaintiff\u2019 and \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d Although Mr. Kitt contends that Capital Concerts placed him in a false light by hiring an actor to impersonate him \u201cplaying\u201d the clarinet, he agrees that the actor neither resembled him, nor \u201cplayed\u201d the way that he would. Certainly, his peers in the music industry would not have mistaken the actor for him. Moreover, there were four other clarinetists in the NSO and, unlike in other cases, there was no identification of the actor, either as Mr. Kitt, or as the principal clarinetist. Cf., Vassiliades, supra, (defendant used plaintiffs actual before and after plastic surgery photographs); Dempsey v. National Enquirer, 702 F.Supp. 934 (D.Maine 1989) (defendant specifically attributed authorship of article to plaintiff). Thus, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Kitt, we cannot conclude that the beauty shot was \u201cof and concerning\u201d him. See Schaffer v. Zekman, 196 Ill.App.3d 727, 143 Ill.Dec. 916, 554 N.E.2d 988, 991-92 (1990) (Plaintiff claimed false statement during editorial that \u201c \u2018evidence was mishandled by the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office\u2019 \u201d was \u201cof and concerning\u201d him because the office employed only two toxicologists, and he was the chief toxicologist. Although dismissing on other grounds, the court noted that the statement did not name or refer to plaintiff, nor mention toxicologists or the chief toxicologist. \u201cAt most, it refer[red] to a group of which [he] is a member, the ... Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\u201d); Bernstein v. National Broadcasting Co., 129 F.Supp. 817, 832 (D.D.C.1955) (concluding that only link between plaintiff and television character in fictionalized dramatization about him \u2014 the alleged physical resemblance of the actor to the plaintiff twenty years prior \u2014 was \u201ctoo tenuous a thread on which to permit a jury to hang identification, with consequent liability for invasion of privacy\u201d).\nIn addition, the facts alleged by Mr. Kitt are insufficient to satisfy the \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person\u201d requirement. Indeed, as the trial court indicated, the actor was not \u201cengaging in any sort of obnoxious or offensive behavior\u201d and it was \u201cunclear whether a musically sophisticated viewer would actually know who was playing.\u201d Consequently, based on the evidence presented, no jury could justifiably conclude that the beauty shot of a man in a tuxedo standing alone \u201cplaying\u201d the clarinet would offend an ordinary, reasonable person. See Machleder v. Diaz, 801 F.2d 46, 49 (2d Cir.1986) (trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and J.N.O.V. because no reasonable juror could have concluded that the alleged portrayal of plaintiff as \u201cintemperate and evasive or as an illegal dumper, of chemical wastes\u201d was highly offensive), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1088, 107 S.Ct. 1294, 94 L.Ed.2d 150 (1987); Osby v. A & E Television Networks, No. 96-7347, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8656, at *16, 1997 WL 338855 (E.D. Pa. June 17, 1997) (no \u201creasonable person could ... find the two scenes of [plaintiff] walking in an airport [in a segment profiling another person engaged in criminal activity] \u2018highly offensive\u2019 \u201d). Nonetheless, Mr. Kitt contends that a jury, not the trial court, should have decided whether the beauty shot would be offensive to \u201ca reasonable performing artist.\u201d We have, however, previously stated that \u201c[w]hile determining offensiveness in an invasion of privacy case is usually the province of the jury, the trial court must make a threshold determination of offensiveness in discerning the existence of a cause of action for intrusion.\u201d Wolf, supra, 553 A.2d at 1219 (citations omitted). Moreover, the offensiveness of such alleged tortious conduct is measured by an \u201cordinary, reasonable person\u201d standard, not that of a reasonable performing artist, as Mr. Kitt incorrectly suggests. Id.\nFraud\n\u201cTo be entitled to a trial on the merits of a fraud claim, a plaintiff must allege \u2018such facts as will reveal the existence of all the requisite elements of fraud. Allegations in the form of conclusions on the part of the pleader as to the existence of fraud are insufficient.\u2019 \u201d Hercules & Co. v. Shama Restaurant Corp., 613 A.2d 916, 923 (D.C.1992) (quoting Bennett v. Kiggins, 377 A.2d 57, 59-60 (D.C.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1034, 98 S.Ct. 768, 54 L.Ed.2d 782 (1978)). The essential elements of common law fraud are: \u201c(1) a false representation (2) made in reference to a material fact, (3) with knowledge of its falsity, (4) with the intent to deceive, and (5) an action that is taken in reliance upon the representation.\u201d Id. (citing Bennett, supra, 377 A.2d at 59). In addition, the plaintiff must show that \u201cprovable damages\u201d resulted from the fraud. Dresser v. Sunderland Apartments Tenants Ass\u2019n, 465 A.2d 835, 839 (D.C.1983). Mr. Kitt argues that he agreed to perform in the concert after relying upon Capital Concerts\u2019 false representation that it would not hire an actor to impersonate him. Thus, he claims that Capital Concerts is liable for defrauding him out of exercising the alternatives available to him as a union member, such as striking or refusing to work. We agree with the trial court that essential elements of a prima facie fraud case are lacking. In light of Mr. Kitt\u2019s contractual obligation with NSO to perform, there is no proof, much less the requisite clear and convincing evidence, that in playing the concert, he relied upon Capital Concerts\u2019 promise not to hire the actor. See Hercules, supra, 613 A.2d at 933 (must prove actual reliance); Owens v. Curtis, 432 A.2d 737, 739 (D.C.1981); Bennett, supra, 377 A.2d at 59 (fraud must be established by clear and convincing evidence).\nFurthermore, in his complaint, Mr. Kitt only makes a blanket allegation that his \u201cprofessional and personal reputations were damaged, and [that] he sustained other damages.\u201d Indeed, he conceded during discovery, as the trial court noted, that \u201c[s]ince the concert, his earnings, performances, and private teachings have increased.\u201d To recover in the District, \u201cappellant\u2019s proof of damages [is] crucial.\u201d Dresser, supra, 465 A.2d at 839 (citations omitted); see also Day v. Avery, 179 U.S.App.D.C. 63, 74, 548 F.2d 1018, 1029 (1976) (per curiam) (\u201ca sine qua non of any recovery for misrepresentation is a showing of pecuniary loss proximately caused by reliance on the misrepresentation\u201d), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 908, 97 S.Ct. 1706, 52 L.Ed.2d 394 (1977) (citations omitted). Thus, we -conclude that his fraud claim must also fail because he has not alleged any provable damages.\nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\u201cTo prove a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, \u2018a plaintiff must show (1) extreme and outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant which (2) intentionally or recklessly (3) causes the plaintiff severe emotional distress.\u2019 \u201d Crowley v. North American Telecomms. Ass\u2019n, 691 A.2d 1169, 1171 (D.C.1997) (quoting District of Columbia v. Thompson, 570 A.2d 277, 289-90 (D.C.1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 942, 112 S.Ct. 380, 116 L.Ed.2d 331 (1991) (internal quotation and citations omitted)). Mr. Kitt contends that Capital Concerts intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him when it broke its promise to not hire an actor to impersonate him. He claims that he suffered \u201cangst, sleeplessness, and humiliation ... as a result of comments and innuendos by colleagues and business associates.\u201d These allegations, however, are simply insufficient to warrant, liability under this tort theory for the following reasons. First, we have repeatedly stated that \u201c \u2018[t]o be actionable, conduct must be so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.\u2019\u201d Weaver v. Grafio, 595 A.2d 983, 991 (D.C.1991) (quoting Howard Univ. v. Best, 484 A.2d 958, 986 (D.C.1984) (internal quotations and citations omitted)); see also Homan, supra note 4, 711 A.2d at 818 (extreme and outrageous conduct does not include \u201c \u2018mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Waldon v. Covington, 415 A.2d 1070, 1076 (D.C.1980) (citations omitted)). Second, Mr. Kitt has offered no evidence proving that his discomfort was greater than a reasonable person could be expected to tolerate. See Sere v. Group Hospitalization, Inc., 443 A.2d 33, 37 (D.C.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 912, 103 S.Ct. 221, 74 L.Ed.2d 176 (1982) (plaintiff must suffer from severe emotional distress \u201c \u2018of so acute a nature that harmful physical consequences might be not unlikely to result\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Therefore, based on the record before us, we cannot say that an average member of the community would consider Capital Concerts\u2019 alleged broken promise so \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d as to permit recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court was correct in entering summary judgment against Mr. Kitt in his false light, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.\nAffirmed.\n. Mr. Kitt also alleged intentional interference with artistic integrity in his complaint, but did not appeal the dismissal of that count.\n. The majority of facts alleged by Mr. Kitt, such as that Capital Concerts never personally asked him to appear in the beauty shot and NSO did not approve the proposed scene, are not only undisputed, but also immaterial to establishing a prima facie showing of his three claims, and thus, irrelevant in our analysis. Others are either not material also, con-clusory, or amount to a question of law which the trial court properly decided: 1) a NSO member commiserated with him over the alleged impersonation; 2) he believes that the shot caused him not to be invited to join other orchestras; 3) he suffered distress as a result of the beauty shot; 4) the contract between NSO and Capital Concerts did not give Capital Concerts' partial or total artistic control; and 5) the image portrayed by the actor in the beauty shot was \"of and concerning\u201d him.\n. Mr. Kitt also argues, incorrectly, that whether Capital Concerts\u2019 conduct was outrageous is necessarily a jury, not trial court, decision. See Homan v. Goyal, 711 A.2d 812, 818 (D.C.1998) (\" \u2018It is for the court to determine, in the first instance, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous\u201d \u2019 to be actionable.)
