        "text": "PER CURIAM:\nIn the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, respondent Richard W. Allison Jr. pled guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Mr. Allison had participated in a scheme to defraud homeowners and mortgage lenders. After Bar Counsel informed this court of the guilty plea, we temporarily suspended Mr. Allison pursuant to D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 10(c) and directed the Board on Professional Responsibility (\u201cBoard\u201d) to institute a formal proceeding to determine the nature of the offense and whether it involved moral turpitude within the meaning of D.C.Code \u00a7 ll-2503(a) (2001).\nIn its Report and Recommendation, the Board concluded that Mr. Allison\u2019s offense constituted moral turpitude per se and recommends disbarment. Neither Bar Counsel nor Mr. Allison takes exception the Board\u2019s Report and Recommendation. We therefore accept the Board\u2019s findings and adopt its recommendation. See D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 9(h).\n\u201cIt is well settled that mail fraud is a crime of moral turpitude per se.\u201d In re Leffler, 940 A.2d 105, 106 (D.C.2007); see In re Schainker, 871 A.2d 1206 (D.C.2005); In re Firestone, 824 A.2d 47 (D.C.2003); In re Evans, 793 A.2d 468 (D.C.2002). Under D.C.Code \u00a7 11-2503(a) (2001), disbarment is mandatory for a member convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude where, as here, a certified copy of the respondent\u2019s conviction is presented to this court. Accordingly, it is\nORDERED that Richard W. Allison Jr. is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia, and his name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys authorized to practice before this court. Mr. Allison\u2019s disbarment shall run, for the purposes of reinstatement, from the date he files an affidavit that complies with the requirements of D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14(g). See In re Slosberg, 650 A.2d 1329, 1331 (D.C.1994).\nSo ordered.\n. Violations of the 2006 edition of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343 and 1349.",
